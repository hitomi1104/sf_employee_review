A terrific re-focus on Equality.","Increasingly over-politicized activism. A significant number of customers, as well as employees of Salesforce, do not share Marc's, and by extension Bay area's, far-left vision of the world. Employees have to keep their mouths shut and opinions to themselves to avoid problems. This year's election put it out in front. Chatter (company's internal ""facebook"") was filled with support for Hillary. Had someone built Trump groups etc., Bay Area folks would have demanded their safe spaces. Personally, I'm not against the Marc's positions and I didn't vote for Trump, but I don't care for the way it impacts employees and some customers. I had a customer this year who refused to go to Dreamforce because of this issue...and that hurts my bottom line.",3 people found this review helpful

12,"Was a great company to work for, not anymore!","Feb 7, 2015 - Manager in San Francisco, CA",3.0,Salesforce was an amazing company with great culture and work environment. It maintained its culture even during the years of exponential growth (2009-12). The talent at this company is phenomenal. Opportunities to contribute and grow were great.,"A bunch of Oracle execs were hired over the last 3 years, and they have been busy replicating the Oracle culture here. The worst changes to the company have come in at the beginning of 2015. Quality Engineering was de-prioritized across the R&D organization. Many of the QE execs have been given different roles (I am not complaining about this. To be fair, many of these so-called QE execs should be fired. Do we really need 10 VPs in Quality Engineering? QE heads are now reporting to development managers. The road ahead points to converting all teams to Engineering teams. So if you are a QE trying to get a job, look elsewhere. Do not listen to the drivel from the recruiters. QE ROLE IS ENDING AT SALESFORCE! Added to this, the conflicting priorities are ever increasing in this company. R&D is at its 3rd attempt to re-write the UI, and make it adaptive at the same time. The so-called Salesforce 1 app was a disaster. The next attempt is starting in 2015. Although there is not a lot of hope for it, many of the ""leaders"" driving this will surely make hay via promotions and stock grants.",Be the first to find this review helpful

20,G & A Positions are terrible,,1.0,"Salesforce has great benefits and they treat their sales, marketing and product development teams as well as any company could treat their employees. Very generous benefits package including great health insurance, company paid for vision insurance, a decent PTO policy, and much more.","Salesforce falls short in how they treat their G&A teams. Succeeding in G&A is not based on skills, qualifications, or ability. As a qualifier, I am not saying this out of spite for being passed over for a promotion or a raise, as I have not even tried for those opportunities yet, this is based on the observations I have of other people in the workforce. First issue, G&A treats those in the main offices much better than they do some of the smaller offices. There truly is a disparate treatment between those in main hubs and those in smaller offices. If you are not located in a main hub, regardless of if the position needs to be at one of the hubs, you have a nearly 0% chance of being given the same opportunities as those in the main hubs. They will not look at what you have accomplished nor will they recognize the value you provide to the company. They will promote from the main hubs or place people in positions that are in the main hubs without even considering other employees across the country. The other key to being given opportunities in the G&A functions is to campaign for the position. Even if you are not the most qualified, if you can make people think you are, Salesforce G&A leadership will not even do interviews to determine who is best for the job. They will wave their little magical wand and poof, the person who has less skills and abilities, but who knew who to align themselves with and convince they are better than everyone else will get moved into positions of authority. If you are a person who does not mind being dishonest, immoral, and you are willing to put down and crush those around you, apply for a G&A function in one of the main Salesforce offices around the country, you will move up quickly and never have to worry about actually knowing your stuff before you are promoted. You may not even need to wait for a position to open up, they may just create a brand new position for you. If you are a great worker who does not like to step all over other people to move up or if you are not in one of the main offices this is not the place for you. They will not even listen to your qualifications skills or abilities when positions open up.",11 people found this review helpful

23,Corporate Nirvana,,5.0,"In my late forties. I've been working in mid-sized software companies since mid-90's. Hired in Jan 2017. Wish I had found this place years ago! - Culture: in most companies, people roll their eyes when this word is used. Not at Salesforce. The spirit of giving back to the local community is strong. The spirit of wanting to do the right thing for the customer is SUPER strong. And the spirit of wanting their employees to succeed and move up is strong. - Pay/Bennies: better than I've gotten elsewhere. - Mgmt: I love my manager. He expects the very best of me, genuinely cares about my work/life balance, and doesn't micro-manage. Lots of opps for my career growth. - Co-workers: the politics are here, but not nearly as strong as other companies. I love my team of 12 people. - Wellness: if you're into Mindfulness, this is your job. Strong mindfulness community, if you look for it.","- Everyone works HARD and FAST. People looking to work the system won't last long. Not for everyone. - It's different in every group, but in my group WFH is not really an option, except 1 day a week (which is ""no meeting Thursdays""). - Srini (under Parker Harris) isn't much of an inspiring leader, and I don't agree with all of his decisions.

I've experienced that volunteering isn't ""encouraged"" unless it's WITH the group (no personal causes) and if you want to support a personal cause, it had better be on the weekend (when you want to spend time with family) rather than during working hours. Cornhole must be played at every event. And people pour themselves into the job, 24/7. No turning off or tuning out - no matter what is ""touted"" from corporate.

If you happen to work on a feature last, you are the single point of contact and have to maintain the whole load of it. -Watch out for all the good perks, at some points, when SalesforceIQ is fully melted into Salesforce family, these perks will also go away. Take a look at the Fraiche account, the Lyft credit, the housing stipend, they are all gone. -Don't let the offer congratz email blast from the recruiting and engineering team cloud your judgement. All the things about the family like culture and what's not, this culture is no longer respected. -Some middle managers are control freaks who like to micro manage every of you move. -Every Friday demo is just a hacky thing that squeezes out your extra work and you feel obligated to demo something to the company. -The quarterly Hackday mentality is just another way you work extra hard and late night to produce something really cool.",7 people found this review helpful

It saddens me that even a below-21 intern feels he/she can't participate fully in the ""culture"" because drinking is such a ""big part"" of it, as seen in a recent Glassdoor review. I don't drink for health reasons, and I often feel like work events (holiday parties, team celebrations, Dreamforce) are less rewarding for me because the non-alcoholic choices are an afterthought. Can I have a $20 gift card instead?! I've seen a lot of employees misbehaving and embarrass themselves through alcohol. Time to cut back. Alcohol is not the same thing as a company culture. Second, I have no illusions that working remotely is a perfect situation. I know I miss out on a lot in the office and I am ok with it. That said, I think the company could do more to make Salesforce better for non-SF members of the Ohana. I also think there should be better career paths for those who are not managers. Because I'm remote, I have been told I don't have much room to move up since I can't manage remotely (even though my manager manages me remotely... and that seems to work fine).

However, there have been a number of changes over the last year that have slowly eroded the magic - starting with some of the new leadership. Our group has become more fragmented and less collaborative. There's more fear of making mistakes and the general sense of trust and support for our work from our leadership has gone way down. The transparency and access we had upwards is becoming more hazy largely because of layers being added. My autonomy and empowerment to make decisions is slipping away. Politics were always there, but now they're something you have to consider daily. You used to be judged based on the work you created and what you shipped, it doesn't feel that way anymore. Some of my favorite people have already moved on. Perhaps it's just the nature of a company growing this fast. There's not a clear avenue for safely giving upwards feedback for our group.

The people at SalesforceIQ are some of the brightest, hard working and friendliest people you can work with. In a fast pace environment, interns are given the same responsibilities as full time employees - making you feel part of the team and contributing to the product. As an intern, not only do you get great experiences with other interns, but executives make time to interact with you and make sure you are invested in your few months as part of the company. This past summer was an internship I will never forget.","It is really hard to think of any negative experiences I have had at SalesforceIQ.

169,Acquisition has been rough on veteran SteelBrickers,,3.0,"The foundation of why SteelBrick was a great place to work still exists in small amounts; great employees, caring and friendly environment, opportunities to move your career forward, etc. - Salesforce has brought on some nice benefits like Volunteer Time Off (VTO), and access to more resources about the SFDC ecosystem that we already lived in as a separate company. So it's been great for employees who were already passionate about this space. -Working at Salesforce now has opened doors to try out new roles in other teams and transfer internally. -Non-sales SteelBrick employees work out of a nice building in SF with great perks; free catered lunches, on-site gym, yoga classes, meditation, etc. Sales team works out of HQ SF office and enjoys being closer to core AE's.","- The Salesforce acquisition changed a lot of things about the culture, positions, teams, and leadership of SteelBrick for the worse (as expected with any acquisition, but still tough to manage). - The acquisition happened so fast (announcement to close ~1 month), that it barely gave employees time to process. The business had to be wrapped up and packaged for SFDC so quickly that employees were basically handed their offer letters and told 'sign now and we'll figure out logistics about how your position will change later'. -The lack of communication during the acquisition, on boarding, and transition process created a divide between leadership and employees, causing distrust in leadership. Employees were commonly given answers about the future of their positions with 'we're not sure yet, we're working on it, and we'll let you know when we figure things out'. - SteelBrick leadership focused primarily on their money-making teams (sales and dev) as their priority to ensure a smooth transition. The other teams we're offered positions with Salesforce, but haven't been given the opportunity to get the same improvements. The leadership team is only willing to fight for the teams that make more money for them. - The further we get into Salesforce, the more we've lost our personal identity and culture. There's not as many fun events or opportunities for employees to come together and enjoy some time off. Everyone's too overworked and underpaid to want to stay around the office longer then they have to.",7 people found this review helpful

179,Great Summer Internship,,5.0,"Specific To Interns: Interns are given a lot of resources to both learn and have fun. There are about 1-3 speaker series every week for interns as well as other tech talks which are open to all employees. There were also so many fun events to help interns explore San Francisco such as a cable car tour, a small cruise ride, or street food tours. Overall Company: The company culture is fantastic. Salesforce is huge on doing social good and do a lot to help employees have a positive impact as well. For example, there is generous donation matching, hours of VTO (time off for volunteering,) and awards for employees who volunteer more. For example, the company has an internal Facebook-like system where posts are public to everyone and most communication / business is done on it. Every 4 months, there's an internal career fair where you can learn about other teams' projects and transfer to another team if you'd like.","It's a larger company so work tends to move more slowly.

181,Like sipping water out of a firehose,,4.0,"Hands down the best product in the market when it comes to Q2C. It's easy enough that even folks without any background in technology can competently set-up and maintain the application. While most competitors need to bastardize their application to ""make it work"", SteelBrick is all about out-of-the-box functionality which makes it a breeze. The market is hot to trot as well. Analysts indicate that Q2C is a massive, multi-billion dollar market by 2019 and even though we have 2x more customers than anybody in the space, we're only scratching the surface. The leadership team at SteelBrick knows everybody by name and works to build meaningful relationships - which goes a long way. Wellness plan covers up to $100 a month and working for Salesforce comes with a BUNCH of employee perks. Offices are moving downtown (and out of the suburbs) which I'm personally excited about.","Before the Salesforce acquisition, SteelBrick was growing at an explosive pace. Since the acquisition, explosive growth is an understatement. With that said, everybody is running at breakneck speed and I think that (as a team) we're a bit worn down. If you join SteelBrick, be prepared to be pulled in a million directions all at once. Work / life balance is out of sorts. Right now (8/22/16), the CORE Salesforce team doesn't have much education on Q2C or understanding of product fit. This means we're talking with a lot of customers that are poor fit or having to field angry calls about why we ""killed"" a poorly qualified opportunity. I don't foresee this problem going away any time soon since Q2C is the most complex product offering in Salesforce's portfolio. There are a limited amount of SteelBrick-certified partners (~50), but customers insist on working with partners that have no experience implementing Q2C applications. This means that their implementations are taking longer than they should. There's nothing we can do about this since it's ultimately the customer's choice, but it puts unnecessary burden on our team. Customers come back during their implementation asking for support, but what they really want is implementation guidance. There is a lot of process change happening right now. For current employees, it's been pretty frustrating. I don't know if this has any barring on new hires, but it does make it difficult to get straight answers since we're all new to these processes as well.",3 people found this review helpful

184,Software Engineering Internship,,5.0,"An amazing summer full of learning, fun, and hard work. The FutureForce team does an amazing job filling the summer with fun experiences (party on a boat, renting out all of SOMA Streatfood Park, a baseball game, and so much more) as well as learning experiences. We had lunch and learns from executives like the CFO, CEO of Heroku, and tons of thought leaders. What's really great about all of these experiences though is that it's clear the fun and learning is not just an opportunity for interns but for full time employees too. Throughout the summer, there was an all Tech and Product summer picnic at the zoo with included animal adventures and an amazing barbecue, a Summer of 99 party, and tons of lunch and learns with internal and external people presenting research. On my team I was able to contribute to features and bugs and was challenged and stretched but supported the whole time. I was able to demo to high level executives and definitely contribute real value. Another really unique aspect of Salesforce is their commitment to Ohana, or family. All of the employees, customers, and partners are treated with the highest level of respect. I especially appreciated the commitment to increasing diversity in the tech industry. One way Salesforce aims to do this is through the employee resource groups, like FemmeForce, BOLD, OutForce, and LatinoForce. Another way Salesforce aims to help the community is through volunteering. Every employee gets 56 hours to volunteer and we as interns were able to spend up to 56 hours volunteering as well! I was able to volunteer at an urban farm, a beach cleanup, and much more!",There really aren't any downsides.

205,"If your company is getting acquired by Salesforce, be careful",,2.0,"- 5 months after my company was acquired by Salesforce, I was ultimately transferred to a manager who was very kind and understanding. Despite having my team thrown upon him, he tried the best that he could without knowing anything about us. He did not micro-manage and I thoroughly enjoyed working for him. I appreciated everything he did for me, but ultimately, he did not have enough power to change the situation. - I loved the people I worked with at my original acquired company and still got to work with them closely after the acquisition. - Good snacks and wellness benefits.","- If you come from an acquisition, Salesforce isn’t going to pay you as well as they pay their internal employees. Even if you are doing the same exact job as someone inside Salesforce, you will probably be making significantly less than what a core employee will be making. It was extremely frustrating and completely demeaning to hear all the hype and news about how Salesforce employees are so happy with their compensation and how Salesforce is making strides towards equal pay. Apparently, acquired company employees are not part of that equation and we do not hold as much value and shouldn’t be treated as equals…ridiculous. I asked for a compensation change in order to match or even come close to the pay of my peers within the Salesforce organization but was told that Salesforce does not have enough internal data to justify a compensation change. Essentially, there was no proof at Salesforce that I was worth a compensation change. This blew my mind because when you first hire someone, you have no proof internally that they are worth the salary that you are going to pay them. What you do instead is evaluate their past experiences and then you determine what is fair pay based on their experiences, skills, and the job that they are doing. You have no internal data or proof in that situation. If you acquire a company, yes, you have no Salesforce data to prove that an employee is worth a certain salary but you acquired a product that you clearly thought had value and the people who helped to create that product are not worth a compensation change because you don't have enough data? I had been working for the acquired company for almost a year, but all of that was meaningless because if you're acquired, it seems like you're not truly a ""Salesforce employee"" and being paid fairly is not something that applies to you. - Our entire acquisition process was a complete mess. My team and I essentially had to operate “as normal” which was completely impossible given that all of our management and the rest of the company were trying to figure out the acquisition themselves. We were lost in the transition, did not have managers for quite some time, and were essentially left to fend for ourselves for the better part of 4 months. It didn’t seem like the M&A team knew what to do with us and had forgotten we existed. - During the acquisition process, we were told that there would be tons of opportunities within the Salesforce organization but once we were in the Salesforce organization, in reality, there were no opportunities. We contacted departments and teams we were interested in and were repeatedly told that they were not hiring or that you needed XYZ experiences that none of us had. We had no choice in what department or role we were assigned. A role was thrown on us, whether we liked it or not, with no other presented opportunities. - My team and I were expected to hit ridiculous numbers as soon as we were acquired despite the fact that we were not fully integrated, did not receive the goal numbers until halfway through a quarter, and still had to facilitate the entire merging of all our systems with Salesforce's systems. We received very little support from the core Salesforce organization and were treated as if we were incompetent because we could not hit these numbers. It seemed like my team and I were being set up for failure so that the core team had a reason to get rid of us once we did not hit a specific goal.",32 people found this review helpful

The company provides inside details on revenue specifics which gives you confidence in its decision. Despite hiring so many people, they still invest quite a bit of the budget into its employees.

Previously, everyone would say ""hi"" to everyone and make a chance to learn everyone's names. Now, there's a ridiculous amount of people and cliques have formed. You can't really fault the company for this, that's on the employees. From an engineering perspective, Pardot is inherently stuck on this giant monolithic legacy code base. When you hire 5 new engineers each week, there are the same exact questions because no one can even google the answer given how old the majority of the tech stack is. There have been efforts to split this out into micro services but decisions are often made by engineering managers and tech leads who have been dispositioned into enterprise related solutions that are often dated for the modern web and just not fun to work with. You can't blame them too much for this, product managers are breathing down their necks constantly. More often than not, these early decisions aren't well thought out and lead to projects getting scrapped 6 months later or resulting in a significant re-design. Annoyingly too that is that Pardot has a concept of ""hack days"" to work on whatever you want. This used to be an engineering fun event and solutions that made a better coding experience would often win. Since the T&P (Technology and Product) lingo started evolving, the only thing that wins is something that can sell something.",1 person found this review helpful

If you're considering joining as a new graduate, I'd highly encourage it. It's a fast moving environment, but you'll learn so much and it'll be a great addition to your career journey.","As a big company, it can be hard to get visibility cross-functionally. This is the first ""big-ish"" company that I have worked for and it is interesting to see how compartmentalized we can get.

Although I was a top performer at my previous company, it was clear that I was disposable to them regardless and they would rather hire someone with less experience than try to retain me (my requests were not related to salary, but changes to projects and overall happiness). I provided a lot of feedback on how to improve processes and promote collaborative culture as other coworkers were feeling similarly, but nothing was done. At Salesforce, I completely feel as if I'm heard by management. I've transferred to several different teams with ease (in fact, after one year at the company they encourage it and create programs to shadow other roles). My managers are genuinely interested in progressing my career and enabling me to succeed and I've enjoyed working with all the teams I've been on. I've had a lot of flexibility to ensure I still have a nice work/life balance and that I actually get to use all the perks available! I personally use all of the $100 gym membership stipend (you can use it for massages too if you don't work out!) and the generous VTO balance (56 hours to volunteer at my local animal shelter, yes please!).","There's a learning curve to trying to not become too corporate, but at the same time 19,000+ employees globally.

312,The Grass Only Looks Greener,"Jun 23, 2016 - in San Francisco, CA",1.0,"Amazing, charismatic and inspiring CEO - I can listen to Marc B. talk for hours! The company has a pretty competitive compensation package, but vacation time needs some work. Health and dental are ok but could use a boost. They pay for your gym membership. Dreamforce is a phenomenal experience","The workforce is not very diverse and the environment is all about doing what it takes to launch product without any thought to employee burn out. No work/life balance & their work from home policy is also misleading. Layers and layers of politics beyond anything you will ever experience (& I've worked for some large corporations but nothing like SFDC)! More often then not, people get promoted based on popularity & not on merit. Internal opportunities are few as they would rather backfill from outside rather than consider developing an internal candidate. I'm surprised at the number of people that say this company cares about their people as all the depts I've worked with including my own often referred to having a ""thankless job"" and the sentiment seemed consistent everywhere I went - the only exceptions are the employees that are fairly new to the company. I am a firm believer in giving back which is why volunteerism was an important criteria for me when seeking out employees. I was so disappointed to discover that my management saw volunteer hours as a game - ""log your hours and volunteer so we can beat the other dept....I will be checking hours by the end of the week"" This is disturbing!",20 people found this review helpful
