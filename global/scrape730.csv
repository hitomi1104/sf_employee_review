242,Horrible Experience in Sales Dev Team,"Apr 19, 2022 - Sales Development Representative",1.0,"Benefits, Good learning exposure, boost to the health sector because you end up buying a lot of headache meds.","Definitely one of the worst decisions of my life. You’d expect a company like Salesforce to have a smooth process. But here’s the real story- My onboarding and interview was an absolute nightmare. This was my dream company, so obviously when I received an offer from them, I accepted it, even if it meant taking a huge pay cut. These guys would leverage Salesforce US culture into talking you down for salaries but would say shamelessly that Salesforce has a transparent pay scale. When I entered the company, I found out that I was the least paid employee in the team. Anyhoo, I accepted the offer and it was their turn to send laptop and other peripherals. Well they didn’t, their procurement team never replied, not on slack, not on calls, not anywhere and I had to bring senior management into this. Well after 15 days of joining, I had received the laptop but mind you even though you don’t have your company phone or company laptop, they’ll start evaluating your performance from day 1, because dude you are in Business Development. So you gotta be an Einstien and a God maybe to do 500 billion things at one time and managers even then would find a way to complain. They expect us to work for 10 hours every day, attend useless meetings, and work like a machine without taking a breath. And they’ll preach about the helping culture of Salesforce, lol. The AEs don’t respond on time, hell even the managers themselves don’t respond until you ping them again and again. And they want us to feel gratitude for the company bevause it pays salary. They have 0 empathy for their employees, they turn deaf ear to our problems. I am suffocating here but I can’t teach out to anyone because guess what everyone is the same. This is a typical employee exploiting company which has created a bubble of a good work culture. PS- this is just for India. I have some friends in the US team of Salesforce and they are having their best time.",2 people found this review helpful

245,"Not so much of an ""Ohana"" anymore","Dec 9, 2021 - Anonymous Employee",3.0,"The 4 star rating was just to give justice for all the years I've spent at Salesforce. For the first few years, the experience was almost a 5-star one. I remembered the days when we actually had great, caring, nurturing, open-minded leaders, where we focused a lot on a great culture and work-life balance.","However, the recent years' experience was more like a 2-3 star company. The culture is definitely not the same anymore. All the decisions are top-down. Some of the leaders don't even have domain knowledge. The culture became very political. Promotions were very unfairly done. No career band framework at all. People being overworked and dragged into political plays. You can't be your authentic self anymore, but have to wear a mask to work everyday coz your boss need you to be 'perfect'.",11 people found this review helpful
