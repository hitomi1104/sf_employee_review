There are some highly intelligent and capable people right throughout the organization. This means that projects and evaluations can become very creative and the standard of work is typically incredibly high. It is by the far best place I have worked in terms of learning from those around you. The benefits are second to none, including health insurance, gym membership, fertility/adoption allowance, generous maternity/paternity leave, a degree of informal flexi-time. The offices are decent, with fresh fruit and snacks available. There are a wide variety of career options available, both internally and also externally due to the expanse of the Salesforce ecosystem.

314,This is the best work culture you you will ever find in an organisation. Best Work Life Balance
323,"Without doubt the majority of the employees at Salesforce are wonderful, combining intellectual rigour with a fierce determination to do the right thing for our customers. The Ohana (broadly interpreted as family) culture is a real living culture, that imbues most people's behaviours. People help each other, and are not focused on trying to get one over on each other. The company is very much in growth mode, which makes for optimism and a sense of purpose."
324,- Community involvement is high with 7 days (56hours) of VTO during business hours encouraged - Better culture for women than most tech companies - Commitment to equality and doing better (appreciating no one is perfect and entrenched bigotry/sexism/racism takes a long time to overturn) - Chief Equality Officer Tony Prophet - Regular salary comparisons to eliminate inequality in salaries based on gender - Australian private health insurance paid by the company - Flexible working arrangements in some teams so you can work remotely
325,"The product is awesome and the culture was fun! Good for getting software sales experience and great for your resume when you interview for jobs. Competing with smart people was challenging and kept me on my toes. I enjoyed working there because I never expected to stay past the 2 year mark. I knew what I wanted going in and was happy with what I got out of it. I learned about the software business, people, politics, how to play the game, and big company culture. Best of all I learned about myself and what I liked and didn't like in a future job. It was an overall great experience for me and helped me to land an amazing job after wards."
338,"Employee benefits are like nothing I’ve ever seen and everyone is so on board with the company culture and vision.

375,"Salesforce is an amazing company! It has a strong and inclusive culture as well as great people. It offers lots of opportunities for career growth and defining your own path as well as very good salary. Lots of learning opportunities. I joined as an experience architect but without experience of Salesforce. My first 90 Days at the company were an educational ramp program designed to immerse me in all the offerings of Salesforce. Really helped me to get up to speed. And the learning opportunities didn't stop after my 90 Day Ramp, Trailhead is a key part of the Salesforce learning system which is always available."
381,- Fantastic perks - Great culture - Excellent level of repsonsibility and exposure
391,"Great opportunities, culture and people!"
402,"Great pay, good people. Successful company. Very flexible. Very open culture with great internal communications system. Not averse to conflict, but communication is respectful. Willing to spend money when its needed. Truly agile, releasing every four months. Invest heavily in test automation."
404,"Senior leader in HQ once said, many companies have an onboarding process that likens a rock tumbler. Salesforce's onboarding likens a car wash. Gentle and gets the same result. This has been my experience so far as a new hire. People around are always looking out for you to make sure you can cope. There's a level of trust and faith that you'll ramp up to be productive in the company. I'll list just a few reasons why Salesforce is the number one place to work. Culture- many of us would agree that it's challenging to explain what working in salesforce is like to those who are not inside, simply because it's rare to find a culture as unique as Salesforce'. When you're in the company, you get a sense of positivity day in and day out, everyone wants to get to know you as a person, it's not just work, it's the person behind the work. You will also feel that every single person in the company sincerely wants you to succeed. From the enablement team equipping you with tools and resources to succeed, to Employee Success (more commonly known outside as HR) taking care of your wellbeing, to your sales leaders leading from the front to win with you, the company's values of trust and growth resonates deeply in the employees. Salesforce is particular about who gets hired in the company. It's not so much of your competency (though it's important), as it is of your character and how you work with people. If you like to outsmart others and constantly seek personal glory, you're not going to have a good time. Leadership - I believe a huge part of the success culture in salesforce stems from the leadership team. Of course, salesforce hires great managers who can already lead and motivate team, but there's a proper coaching system which enables each employee to align with the direction of our leaders vision quickly, and also improve performance. Think professional athlete teams. Continuous training and learning - we get a ton of training and resources on industry trends, salesforce products, professional skills like giving effective feedback etc. There's a proper system in place for those who want to develop their competencies or gain more knowledge. Even staff who are here for many years benefit from the training and development programs. The fun 'stuff' - you get wellness reimbursements (some get gym memberships, some get supplements, you can use it for most physical activities). There're also many team activities and celebrations which makes work a whole lot more fun. We also have 7 days volunteering time off where you can do it with the team or on your own. Big shoutout to the team in Singapore for making Salesforce the number one place to work!"
413,Great work culture and learning environment.
423,"Amazing culture, opportunities, benefits and salary. Career development second to none. Company Growing rapidly. Staff are looked after and peers genuinely care. Amazing community/charity giving back program - staff actively encourage to volunteer 7 days per year during normal working hours (inc as part of annual Goals). Manager / company very appreciative of goals achieved / job done"
426,Lots of growth and learning; incredible CEO and visionary; fun culture; great pay and earning potential
429,"This is the best time of my career. Salesforce is an extremely successful company that combines unique values with innovative technology. You can effectively contribute towards making the world a better place while working on a fast-paced tech environment where your company is a leader and an innovator. The Salesforce Ohana culture is unique and an example to companies worldwide. There are many growth opportunities within the company and you feel that you're constantly growing, while being properly supported."

441,"Salesforce is a great place to work with a bunch of top notch people and an awesome culture. If you are the kind of person who likes holding yourself against others and being in a healthy competitive environment, this is a good fit. The opportunities to progress are tied to results and management will work to help you find a path if one isn't working for you."
442,"Great Culture, Flexible Hours, Excellent Benefits and Rewards, Exceptional Talent Pool, Opportunity to grow yourself & Reimbursements for training programs attended by Employees (For employee growth).

The leadership team give the ECS team the confidence to thrive under high pressure and they create an inclusive and supportive culture which develops leaders with the team. The coaching provided is world class and the ECS business is recognised for nurturing and developing talent within Salesforce. The management team will always go above and beyond to support their team."

481,"This review will probably come off biased as I've spent the last 8 years at SF and have grown my career with the company. I also met my wife at SF and we now have a lovely 2 year old daughter so suffice to say the decision to work here has proved a good one personally as well as professionally. I started fresh out of university with no idea what CRM or cloud computing was in a biz dev role, progressed into sales and am now a sales manager. Here are the top reasons I love SF: - upward mobility: the company is growing 30% YoY and with growth comes opportunity. I've held 6 positions in 8 years working here. - people & culture: I'm humbled on a daily basis by the people I work with. SF employees are smart, ambitious, fun and tend to genuinely care about the communities we work in and the world around us. There are exceptions to every rule, of course, but by and large we're a hard-working, fun-loving, high-achieving group that is just as collaborative as we are competitive. - pay: money talks! Compensation and benefits are top notch. For those in sales, the base pay will seem low but in 8 years I've never made less than 30% more than my OTE (base + commission). - trust: the vast majority of the people I've reported to have instilled a lot of trust in me to get my job done without interfering or micro-managing my day-to-day."
482,"- Flexible workplace with lots of freedom - Multi culture, friendly environment - Good basic perks for all full-time employees - Kitchen stacked with breakfast, snacks and drinks - A good space for fun, creativity and humor - Moving up usually works as planned (most cases)"
486,"Heroku has had its ups and downs over the last few years as it has become more integrated with the larger Salesforce org, but it still feels staffed by the best minds in the business, and I love the product that we make. Salesforce itself has all the pros and cons of a large org, complete with hawaiian culture kool-aid and large-org inertia, but on the whole it feels like Benioff puts his money where his mouth is on societal issues, in a way that few corporate titans do. They're generous when it comes to family and benefits and have a corporate culture of giving. Inside Heroku, we are still a little bit inside our purple-tinted bubble. On balance it feels like the engineers, junior to senior, are a standard deviation or two above the median. The problems we solve are difficult and satisfying. The business is large and the opportunity remains even larger. It feels miraculous that we operate a product at such crazy scale with so few people, and speaks to our expertise in building scalable, automated things."
488,"-Scope of career possibilities is amazing -Employee benefits are above and beyond what I had hoped for -Career Development opportunities are regularly offered with open discussions invited. -Social company culture -Pay rates are generally well above the average -Being a cloud company, we have the opportunity to literally work from anywhere in the world! (I know cause I've done it!) -Individual contributions and ideas are invited, shared, discussed and respected. One idea really can bring change with our very democratic process with sharing and collaborating on ideas and concepts."
489,"Jeff Bezos said: “Your brand is what people say about you when you are not in the room”. I prefer “Your brand is how people take care of it when you are no longer in control”. The way my colleagues talk and care about Salesforce business when Salesforce is not in control is just amazing. To me is the sign of an healthy company culture and vision, very proud to be part of this Ohana (family)."
490,"I have been a professional for about eight years have held various positions with different employers in different locations - Salesforce is by far the best place to work. The culture is amazing and it is felt on a daily basis. As an employee, I feel valued and trusted; Salesforce invests a lot in its employees and the career opportunities are incredible. I wouldn't want to work anywhere else."
498,"Fantastic people and culture, especially at the field and mid-level range. Incredible technology and very smart acquisition strategy. Really, with the exception of maybe Google, this is the only place to be in tech, in terms of making an impact on the way the world does business. Also, the (genuine) philanthropic focus remains strong and helps in fostering a very strong team culture."
506,"It is great working for Salesforce. If you like the Salesforce products then this is a place closest to the source where all the magic happens. Great culture (transparent, open, collaborative) and loads of highly knowledgeable experts around you. A lot of autonomy is granted as long as you deliver."
507,"Over my career with Salesforce I've had the chance to work with and influence the development of many of the product offerings. The pace of innovation - some organic, some acquisition related is phenomenal and for an engineer like myself I feel I'm involved in using the latest technology to help our customers. I've worked at many companies - the culture at Salesforce is definitely different and in a very good way."

Salesforce hires extremely talented, ambitious, and laser-smart people, and I've learned more here in 6 months than I have in the last several years. The salary is excellent, benefits unparalleled, and the culture is one of generosity and giving back (volunteer hours are highly encouraged and employees can take time off work, with pay, to give back to their communities locally and globally)."
538,Nice working culture and healthy competition.

In Dublin we take care of lower end clients so interest from main office is really small and standard on management is very low. Focus is on monthly sales and quizzing out of the clients anything you can like there is no tomorrow. Also there is way too many sales guys and very very few hit target. Pressure is really high on Sales guys and turnover of sales staff is very very high.

801,"Was debating between this company and a few other large tech companies in the bay area. Was blown away by the culture and people here. It sounds cliche, but the people here are really what made me choose SalesforceIQ. Everyone is social, intelligent, and extremely helpful. Onboarding has been smooth and the development pace is much faster than what you'd find in a traditional tech company. You get the best of both worlds within SalesforceIQ - a startup environment that has the stability of a large company. Compensation is highly competitive with the bay area. SalesforceIQ was definitely one of the best choice I've made."

858,"In Indy, the people, environment, and culture are what really sets Salesforce Marketing Cloud apart from other places I have worked. The people that are hired in Indianapolis, are a different breed than most-in a good way. I am in sales, and we are a sales family, rather than everyone being selfish and only out for themselves."

There are about 1-3 speaker series every week for interns as well as other tech talks which are open to all employees. There were also so many fun events to help interns explore San Francisco such as a cable car tour, a small cruise ride, or street food tours. Overall Company: The company culture is fantastic. Salesforce is huge on doing social good and do a lot to help employees have a positive impact as well. For example, there is generous donation matching, hours of VTO (time off for volunteering,) and awards for employees who volunteer more. For example, the company has an internal Facebook-like system where posts are public to everyone and most communication / business is done on it. Every 4 months, there's an internal career fair where you can learn about other teams' projects and transfer to another team if you'd like."

964,"I've been at Salesforce for several years now after coming from one of the big 4 consulting firms, and it's been night and day! Although I was a top performer at my previous company, it was clear that I was disposable to them regardless and they would rather hire someone with less experience than try to retain me (my requests were not related to salary, but changes to projects and overall happiness). I provided a lot of feedback on how to improve processes and promote collaborative culture as other coworkers were feeling similarly, but nothing was done. At Salesforce, I completely feel as if I'm heard by management. I've transferred to several different teams with ease (in fact, after one year at the company they encourage it and create programs to shadow other roles). My managers are genuinely interested in progressing my career and enabling me to succeed and I've enjoyed working with all the teams I've been on. I've had a lot of flexibility to ensure I still have a nice work/life balance and that I actually get to use all the perks available! I personally use all of the $100 gym membership stipend (you can use it for massages too if you don't work out!) and the generous VTO balance (56 hours to volunteer at my local animal shelter, yes please!)."

I have worked with more execs in my one here at Salesforce, than I had in my 5 years at my previous company. Salesforce is also very engaging with volunteer opportunities, speakers and other hosted events that expose you to new ideas and perspectives both internally and externally. Lastly, pay and benefits are very fair."
993,"Great culture, benefits, flexibility, and compensation. Working with some of the smartest people around The company is constantly growing and it's an exciting time. The company is focused on giving back and letting employees do what they are interested in. Working with some of the most respected technology on the market."

1002,culture is laid back and accepting
1003,"Seriously a phenomenal culture and place to work all around. Employees are being spoiled by Salesforce and in turn are given way more employee perks (housing/travel stipend, regular events, ect), and are in an environment where employees have amazing opportunities for growth in their careers and abilities. The engineering culture is open and employees are often encouraged to teach others their expertise. The team is impressive and talented, and for the most part, the only people that have ever left the company have only done so to go start their own companies."
1007,"The culture is phenomenal. Salesforce provides a culture of ""pay it forward"" which is evident in every department. They are huge on team selling, so you win as a team and loose as a team. There's endless resources to learn, training galore, and the office is like a 2nd home to me. By far the best job i've ever had and I see myself growing, moving up ladder, and having cross departmental opportunities for a very long time."

1047,"Salesforce, as a whole, is by far the best company I could wish to work for. It was my dream company to work for, mainly because of the culture. Beyond the in-house perks, there’s the 56 hours a year we are given to volunteer and give back in pretty much anyway you see fit. The benefits are superior to any company I’ve worked for. The buildings are a pleasure to work in each day. They focus on wellness and striking a good work-life balance. And in all earnesty, want to, and do give back to our communities."
1048,"Original CEO, doing more for the community and social change, but isn't involved in how the company is run and the ""Ohana"" culture is not working, look inside.. you can create ""Ohana"" but if people are stabbing eachother in the back and arrogant, there is no Ohana."
1049,"Great opportunity to make money. There is no lack of business. This can be a pro and a con, it is very young culture, the average age is 29."

1109,Company culture aligns well with publicly stated values Training is comprehensive and supported by manager

1114,"Great teams, great benefits, great culture."
1116,"The company truly embodies the tenets it stands for - Trust, Customer Success, Equality, Growth. There is a feeling of Ohana (family) within the entire community.

It was a very hard decision to leave Salesforce, and while I learned a lot at the start-up, I also gained a lot of context regarding how great my experience was at Salesforce. I am now back at Salesforce, and while I interviewed with other companies, I wanted to come back to Salesforce. Pros: Great culture Great onboarding You work with brilliant people People care, a lot You get to help companies successfully transform"

1141,"Salesforce made me feel welcome from day one, respecting my diversity and who I am. It is a very supportive company where everyone is willing to help you succeed. The culture can be overwhelming at first and might not be for everyone, but if it is a good fit, it will be one of the main reasons for you to go to work every day."
1144,"-Community (52 hrs paid volunteering, 1-1-1 model, Ohana groups for a variety of identity affiliations and allies) -Training (1 mo. in and I have had 5 full days of training on culture, products and many 1/1s and small group meetings in my own department to get oriented) -Leadership transparency (Laulima: 2x/yr all-hands strategy meeting)"
1150,"Definitely the best job I've ever had, the work is constantly changing, endless opportunities to learn something interesting everyday. The culture at the company is very strong and they emphasize it constantly. There's very few companies that have as good of benefits as Salesforce healthcare, well being, volunteer time. There's so many programs it seems impossible to take advantage of them all (check em out at getsalesforcebenefits dot com). There's also so many different offices and positions within the company, and it's strongly encouraged to move around."

1239,Very strong brand recognition in market. Great experience selling an enterprise platform solution. Strong internal culture of giving back (1:1:1 Model). Superb CEO ledership. Fun perks.

1261,"Woven into the culture of Salesforce is both the strong desire to make the world a better place and the enabling of each employee to do exactly that. Volunteer time isn't a once-a-year event; it's seven full days of paid volunteer time every fiscal year. Colleagues (at least within my rather large extended team) are incredibly helpful. At least part of the reason is that we're encouraged to work cross-group, avoiding the ""silo"" effect. Salesforce invests heavily in maintaining its distinct culture as it grows rapidly."
1263,"Great leadership team, proven track record of success, relevant and improving perks for employees, builds a productive and successful team culture."

1286,"Great benefits, very nice culture. I have heard phrases along the lines of ""at least we're paid well to do it"" multiple times in passing now. There is a saying that if others at your company talk about being underpaid, chances are you're being underpaid as well. This place is definitely not the case."
1288,Great culture Great people Great benefits Great perks Great name I’m a little more than a week into my new role at Salesforce and loving it so far.
1291,"I worked for both large and small companies, and even though Salesforce is not small (over 30000 employees and counting!) it does feel like one, rather than a megacorp. I don't know how they've been able to retain this culture for almost 20 years but it is definitely working! Salesforce does care about its workforce as a whole and every member of the family individually."
1295,"Everyone talks a good game about caring for their employees or feeling as though an employee is a part of a family. And, speaking from experience, that's usually where that sentiment ends...with talk. Salesforce consistently PROVES how much they care about their employees, their customers and their customer's customers. I have never worked for an organization that worked so diligently to provide a healthful, relaxed and comfortable place in which to excel. This organization is truly unique and truly head, shoulders, knees and toes above every other place I've ever chosen to be employed. They earn their ""Best Places to Work"" status every day and I am proudly soaking up the culture of inclusiveness, equality and contributing to the greater good. Happy days!"
1297,"In my first 30 days this journey at Salesforce has been nothing short of inspiring! I have been in the workforce over 35 years, working for corporate America, small companies and large tech companies as well. Never have I felt so much enablement, support and encouragement as I have felt and witnessed here at Salesforce. I have always told my family, ""company culture"" is more important than salary and benefits."
1299,"Dynamic and awesome culture, lots of social events. Lots of training and knowledge sharing opportunities. Great benefits. Working from home frequently (this may depend on the team). ""No meetings"" Thursdays."
1303,Amazing on boarding experience. The company culture really shines and everyone is very helpful and willing to give time to help out.
1304,"Supportive folks are everywhere at this company. Everyone wants everyone to be successful because they want the company to be successful. There's a wonderful culture of giving, Ohana, and equality. Everything at Salesforce moves fast, but it's so worth it."
1307,"The 1-1-1 Model here (google it) and a tangible benefit that results of it is 7 full days of VTO (volunteer time off) to be used responsibly at your discretion. Matching gifts to a non-profit of your choice. - Benefits here overall are incredible - ESPP is attractive - Time off is generous - comp package works in your favor- i.e. hard work does in fact = revenue. - equipment is all up-to-date and excellent (iPhone as work phone, and MacBook as laptop) - Training that consists of bootcamp in San Francisco, and further training at a local hub. Ongoing trailheads and updates also keep you on your toes. - Fast-paced environment - Great culture - Talented professionals - Collaborative environment across different segments - Brand recognition - Smooth employee processes in the background (payroll, time logged, benefit tracking, incentive tracking, employee profile, etc). - Continuous acquisitions of companies continues to strengthen our products and offerings. - Snacks, events, and happy hours - Flexibility and autonomy given to consult with your clients - Networking opportunities here are endless"

1309,Great culture and teammates. Very supportive environment
1311,"I feel so lucky to be apart of Salesforce. Interview process and bootcamp was fantastic and everyone truly wants you to succeed. I was skeptical of the “Ohana” culture prior to my first day but it is the real deal. Yes, it can be stressful at times but that is to be expected with any leading company."
1312,"The culture and people are fantastic! Everyone is very friendly, and I'm happy to come into work everyday."
1317,Good product and culture for sure
1318,Amazing company culture. You will become a sales assassin
1319,Great company Tons of opportunities Startup culture Global company
1321,"The culture at Salesforce is great. People and teams are collaborative and helpful overall, and people seem to work within the framework that we're working toward a shared goal as opposed to competition against each other as I have experienced at previous jobs. Management seems willing to listen to employee's ideas, concerns, and grievances and do what they can to address them. Lots of decent perks, good pay (I'm not in the bay area, so can't speak for there), and reasonable workloads."
1322,-supportive and fun culture -great benefits -opportunity to learn
1323,Great work culture. Smart people. Good Work life balance.

2169,"Quality work/life balance - This is baked into the benefits and culture. Although, you need a manager that actually supports this for you. If you have that it is great but, when you don't it can feel defeating. Personally, I have experienced the good and the bad with this. Training - Trailhead is a wonderful tool that provides a great introduction to many products/services. It's self-guided and you can pursue what interests you at your own pace. Time off to volunteer - Again a great benefit but, your manager has to be supportive of your endeavors. Employees are encouraged to give back using the 1/1/1 model. On one hand you are praised if you meet or exceed the number of hours you give back. If you don't have a manager or a team that does a lot of volunteer work, you might be criticized or singled out for ""wasting time."" Free Snacks - This is nice when you need a 3:00 snack or can't get out for lunch. Access to great perks - Wellness activities, a gym, workout classes, a benefit you can use to pay for massages. Unlimited vacation time, sometimes free tickets to events."

Management will set you up to succeed by providing all the resources, trainings, and other tools needed to make it to ""get to the next level"" and advance your career. I personally have no immediate plans to switch teams because I currently love the work that I am doing right now. I have seen people easily move across different teams and organizations (lateral and vertical) within Salesforce without issue. This is important to those that want to eventually work on different projects/teams/technologies within the company. The company promotes a lot of volunteering for employees and is consistently active within the community. It's recommended and encouraged for employees to volunteer and give back and they set a side a large amount of VTO (Volunteer Time Off) for you to do so. I absolutely love this because volunteering makes such a big impact to those in need. You are treated with dignity and respect working here. I have never come across any issues while working here but there is always an open channel to communicate with management (direct management or other management) if you do encounter anything. Senior management is very honest and transparent during meetings/emails/town halls, ect. with what is going on within our organization and company as a whole. Besides all of the stuff mentioned above, there are: - Excellent Work/Life Balance (I've never worked a weekend, I get off on time each day, and have never felt any stress while working here) . All of our work as a team is consistently completed by the deadlines too! - Unlimited opportunities to learn and grow your career with tools/resources readily available. (The company promotes enablement and provides you with a bountiful of resources to get to where you want to go in your career) It's just up to YOU to activity take initiative and take advantage of them! - You have the ability to take Professional Led Salesforce Certification classes for free - Tuition Reimbursement - Commuter benefits - ESPP - Amazing health insurance packages - Awesome views from the top of the Salesforce Tower - Ability to work from home every now and then (varies from team to team and role) - Baristas available in the main buildings to provide free handcrafted coffee and tea - Professional Chef's making food at the top of the Salesforce Tower and in Salesforce East - Arcade games, pool tables, ping pong tables, foosball, - Various ERG Groups to join (they do a lot of events that are fun and good for the community) - Social groups to join (Board games, video games, camera clubs, exercise/workout classes) - Lots of comfy sofas/lounge chairs - Access to the Salesforce Park - Awesome holiday parties!!! - HUGE Dreamforce event every year (Really fun and informative) All and all, this is absolutely the best company I have ever worked for and I currently don't have any intensions of leaving. 😃"

At the end of the day, it's the people of ExactTarget that have made me find this company to be so special. We have created and maintained this internal culture, which we simply define as ""Orange."" As a result, I have the opportunity to work with some of the most innovative, kind, smart, and hardworking people I've ever met. From leadership down, we all try to follow strong ethical values for our customers, for the community, for ourselves. One of my favorite things is how they always seem to be giving back. I feel like I'm a valued employee because ExactTarget thanks their employees. Not just verbally, once a year at the holiday party cramped into a break room - but with quantifiable actions, benefits, and rewards. • Growth opportunities that include yearly reviews with internal promotions encouraged • Career development courses, tuition reimbursement (up to $5000/year after 1 year at ET), mentorship opportunities, and a dedicated Talent Management team to support you • Networking opportunities (ie ExactWIN - our Women's Inspirational Network, ExactFun - They plan over 40+ social events like going to the Indian's game with the family, drinks and apps at Howl at the Moon, our annual holiday party at Crane Bay etc) • Volunteering opportunities encouraged by the company (6 Volunteering Days off/year, ExactImpact and ExactFoundation - organizations that participates in local service and grant opportunities with organizations like Gleaners, Habitat for Humanity, as well as local schools and hospitals.) • Reasonable time off.

2586,"This company is growing and has rightfully earned many accolades. The benefits are fantastic, and you'll earn a lot of money if you're smart, motivated, and get things done. One key piece of advice that I have is to be proactive about your career. It can be tempting to code all day long, but you'll need to take a step back every now and then to chart your course over the next several releases to get ahead and stay in control of your career. If you don't, then others may put you into a direction that you might not like. Take charge and make your case to others, and resources will flow to you if others agree with your vision. That actually ties in well with my next point. Every year, each of us must create a ""V2MOM,"" which is Marc Benioff's method of distilling down what you want to do over the next year from both a high level and from a detailed level. You start off with a single vision, list your values, determine the methods that will realize your vision, identify the obstacles that may prevent you from realizing your vision, and create metrics that can measure how you know when you've realized your vision. Many people secretly blow it off and just copy their managers' V2MOMs, but if used properly, it really can make a difference in your own career. As one of the leaders had said, you get from it what you put into it. If you really embrace and use the V2MOM, you'll go far both at work and in life. The culture increasingly uses the V2MOM in its decision making and resource allocations. But don't worry; it's not a cult or anything remotely like that. Salesforce.com invests heavily in its employees. From the high-end office space to comfortable interiors, generous benefits, and firm commitment to meeting and exceeding workplace fairness, policy, and procedure rules and laws, anyone can be free to be themselves at Salesforce.com and do the best work of their lives. I know I am :). I'm an openly gay male, and that has never been held against me (as far as I'm aware, at least)."

At Salesforce we have that in spades. Not only are my immediate team always willing to pitch in and help, but so is the wider pre-sales organisation and people from other teams. There is a really strong sense of family in the organisation that stems from the CEO downwards and permeates the culture. The products are rock solid too, and continually evolve at a terrific pace which keeps a techy like me constantly challenged and interested (always something new to learn)"

3582,"Salesforce has a really solid business model, with a subscription-based approach to software that was revolutionary when it was first introduced 23 years ago. This subscription-based approach means that ongoing revenue can be relied on, for all customers that remain with the company. Since the attrition, or the loss of customers, is very low, this means that the cash flow for this business is very reliable and predictable over the long term. The company really strives to gain the trust and to ensure that customers are successful. These happy customers then become highly referenceable, and recommend our solution for others. Our product has become such a vital part of their business that it is also very sticky over the long term. As our company continues to acquire new capabilities, our solution becomes even more enticing and relevant, since we can address and integrate a broad cross-section of the needs of each of our customers (Marketing, Sales, Commerce, Service, Analytics). We deliver a comprehensive enterprise software solution, which is cohesive and integrated in ways that no other company can provide. In addition to this, we constantly think of ways to innovate and make our customers lives easier. We are able to digitize and improve the efficiency of a broad cross-section of enterprises out there who do not focus on digital solutions as their core business. All of these factors together represent a very strong opportunity for continued growth of this business. Salesforce has also been executing really well on surmounting many of the more difficult technical challenges that they faced due to the fact that the product is based on legacy code. There is technical debt related to the database, also there is a major migration underway to move to the public cloud. The company has executed incredibly well on these and many other challenges internally. The culture is incomparable. The leadership of the company have a genuine concern for each employee, and a real investment in doing the right thing for the community. The company takes a leading role in helping to champion initiatives that address homelessness and environmental issues for example. We also are really committed to the success of all of our stakeholders, including employees, customers, partners, communities, and all of the trailblazers who form the broader salesforce community. The ecosystem of administrators, architects and developers who are part of our space has continued to grow, and the company is also really proactive in helping to develop the skills of those people that might be interested in growing a career with our products."

3756,"- Innovative company and culture that is striving to be best-in-class when it comes to driving social impact, emphasizing diversity and inclusion, giving back to the community, sponsoring employee wellness and development, and carrying out sustainability initiatives. Salesforce lives and leads with its values from the top down and encourages transparency and feedback throughout the organization. - For a large enterprise, Salesforce works hard to ensure we are agile and nimble. The company is not afraid to fail fast, pivot strategies, execute on new ideas and proactively lead with a bold vision in the face of a rapidly changing world. The phrase ""Better, better, never best"" is a great way to describe the culture. - Individually in my customer-facing sales role, I enjoy being able to work with so many different types of businesses and executives. It's rewarding to help clients succeed, transform, and adapt their businesses - and it's also a fantastic learning experience for my own development. Because Salesforce has such a huge platform, we are enabled to have conversations with every business department and are empowered to deliver real value. While we are selling a technical product, working at Salesforce allows me to elevate the conversation by leaning on Salesforce's own internal success and leadership to inspire my customers. - There is a sense of pride in working here; there are just so many cool things about this company, it's hard to list them all!"

5184,"Great benefits, very nice culture. I have heard phrases along the lines of ""at least we're paid well to do it"" multiple times in passing now.

The former ExactTarget culture still exists to an extent but is fading over time. Marketing is a growing area in most companies, so there is plenty of room for growth. Being a part of Salesforce is a benefit from a company values perspective. The 1-1-1 model makes me proud to work for an organization that gives back."

The company is built on certain core values and these are amazingly into each and every employee. The working staff and management are very kind, understanding and motivating. The other best thing about them is the equal pay policy. This means that everybody at a certain level gets paid in the same range if not exactly equal.

Coming straight out of college where I got to study and work on interesting challenges in 7 different countries, I was looking for a culture that promotes continuous learning and problem-solving. Salesforce proved to be beyond my expectations. Being one of the most innovative companies in the world, there are so many moving parts that make this company great. There is always interesting stuff to fill your plate with. What amazes me is that even though the company has grown to a headcount of 40k+, the opportunities and encouragement for cross-team collaborations match that of a startup."

5884,The culture is the differentiator. Amazing senior leadership team that drives the company in the right direction
5888,Amazing culture and opportunity for employees
5889,"Salesforce's culture has consistently exceeded my expectations time and time again. Salesforce truly acts in the best interest of their employees, instead of only focusing on shareholders. This has become even more apparent during the COVID-19 pandemic. Salesforce quickly and efficiently shifted to having all their employees work from home to protect their safety, began weekly company-wide calls with the executive leadership team so employees are always away of updates across the company during COVID, financially supported employees' home office setups, made numerous additions to the benefits plan to adjust to COVID-19, and continually prioritize employee wellbeing during all these changes. Salesforce talked a lot about ""Ohana"" or ""family"" in my interviews, I'm so happy to say that culture they talk about to candidates is genuinely the culture we all get to experience day-to-day. It's everything I had hoped, and more!"

5996,What can be said that hasn't already? Great product. Strong leadership. Fun culture. Salesforce is an extremely competitive place that hires outstanding people. You are never the smartest person in the room and there are nearly unlimited resources to help you do your job.
5998,"Honestly I thought people were just ""drinking the Kool-Aid"" from the reviews posted, but this large company lives and breathes their culture & values. COVID put all companies to the test and Salesforce reacted with their employees (and customers) first and still continues as the pandemic stretches on. I have been incredibly impressed at everything they have done and continue to do to make sure we still make money, keep our health and family life in mind, and over communicate so we know exactly what is happening inside and outside of the company. COVID aside, the people they hire are all really talented and a culture fit so you are working with incredibly smart people that want to help you succeed even if they don't benefit at all. I don't think I've run across one person yet that hasn't offered to help with anything I need now or in the future. The bar has been set incredibly high and I don't see myself making a move to another company anytime soon, even if I was offered more money. I am happy at my job and feel really supported and am encouraged to take breaks or days off to recharge. Highly recommend!"
6001,It is a laid back culture

6056,I worked for Pardot prior to it being acquired by Salesforce. They have a pretty good culture considering their size.
6058,"First and foremost, the company's philosophy on philanthropy is great. Salesforce fosters a culture where every employee is encouraged to give and allows for great team events. Also, the past successes of Salesforce have set itself up for great continued growth as a company."
6072,"Great people, great training, fun culture, career options"
6074,"The best product by far...bar none. The best visionaries, technical ops (the guys that keep the platform up and running), and internal platform engineers on the planet - these are the guys that deserve all the glory. What is done behind the scenes to keep the app going is nothing short of amazing - several million concurrent users while constantly adding functionality and innovating...and no down time? Come on. It's ridiculous. The tenured and long-timers that are still around are incredible. They're not only the best in the company, they're the best in the industry. Prove yourself to them and they will take care of you. If YOU have the drive and the ability, you can build a career path in the company...and if YOU make a case and have something behind it, it's one of the few companies in the world that will allow you to do so. Salesforce will not give you a map when you're hired that shows you a career path...but if you succeed in the role you're giving and prove yourself and earn trust, they'll actually allow you to create your own. The culture of the company is like nothing else in the world. Yes...you are expected to work more than anywhere else in the world...but if you like philanthropy, no questions asked...go do it - on company time. The best in the business keep coming on board. Marc is the best CEO in the business - different for sure - but the best. For a few years I thought the company had plateaued...several different times (at $750M...at $1B..at $2B...)...but I really do see this company making it to $10B in rev and beyond. Without a doubt. So if you're considering joining Salesforce but are worried about growth, don't be. That should be the last of your concerns."
6078,"Smart colleagues with passion for the product and driven to perform at 110% to make sure the product is successful at launch. Bonuses were regularly paid and pretty good. Highly collaborative cross functional culture between product, design, and engineering. People weren't afraid of making the hard calls to move the teams forward."

6207,"I just joined Salesforce.com, and my experience has been excellent in every way. The onboarding process has been a breeze because the company uses the tools they sell which allows new hires to get up and running quickly. Specifically, the company uses Chatter groups where employees can find virtually all the information they need for any questions and get immediate responses, rather than spending 6 months trying to find out ""who does what"" within their new company. Furthermore, everybody I speak with seems to love working here and the company culture is very positive and supportive of employee success."

7541,"Salesforce is an amazing company. Built on the foundation & philosophy that “we do well by doing good”. This is true for how we care for our customers, employees and the communities and world we live in. It’s truly remarkable to see 17,000 people rowing in the same direction. From “Day 1” to today I continue to be impressed. Growth and innovation run through the DNA of the company. Which gives it the feeling of a 16-year-old start up & creates exciting opportunities for individual career growth. Exciting to work for a company with this type of trajectory. Performance of our industry-leading products results in very happy customers. And our customer list represents the world’s greatest brands in every industry vertical. The culture is unlike any other company I’ve worked for. As a sales person, it’s great to know we view “sales is a team sport” and “no one wins or loses alone”. And the teams I get to work with are made up of the top talent in every discipline. Compensation is great and the benefits are exceptional."
7552,Amazingly talented people and culture. Incredibly sales driven organization that sets you up for success and gives you access to world class training and processes. Tons of career advancement and development opportunities

7562,"Marketing Cloud offers a ton of great solutions. They are (mostly) fully integrated, which many competitors can't say, and the individual solutions are leaders in their respective areas. The former ExactTarget culture still exists to an extent but is fading over time. Marketing is a growing area in most companies, so there is plenty of room for growth. Being a part of Salesforce is a benefit from a company values perspective. The 1-1-1 model makes me proud to work for an organization that gives back."
7566,The focus on philanthropy is unlike any place I've worked and truly is great. 7 days of Volunteer time off and 5k donation matching is huge. It really is an important piece of the culture. I'd also say: - Competitive Pay - ESPP program - Fun people - Office downtown SF - The coffee shops - Company events
7571,Salesforce is a fantastic culture and really embodies their core values and follows through with them. It also does a great job at supporting distributed teams.
7575,"Please are great and super supportive. When you join the company, everyone is there for you, to help you learn and do the best you can. 6 months in, it's still the same. In addition, the culture of the company is great. Not only are you encouraged to support your colleagues but you're also encouraged to help the community. Volunteering is a big part of the company and trust and customer success are one of out most important values. We're not just saying it. We're actually practicing it too. In addition, for such a large company, we're moving lightning fast, we 3 major releases a year. This dictates a fairly fast pace for planning, developing and releasing."

Opportunity to really contribute to change. Access to global organizations (customers) making a difference in the experience of great numbers of people. The culture, openness, intention for good, and larger ideals to which the company subscribes make this work more than a job."

7596,"Strong numbers (benefits, salary, bonus, stock, etc). Stronger culture. Commitment to the customer success is unrivaled. Amazing products solving real problems.

7675,I have never been at a company where you should expect to be promoted within 18 months. The growth opportunity is unmatched by all other tech companies here in the Chicago. The culture in the office is amazing. I have never worked at a job where I have enjoyed Sundays because I always dreaded Monday. Everyone works hard and plays hard. I am constantly referring Salesforce to my friends.
7677,"I have been employed by salesforce.com for over 3 years and it is exciting to be at a growing, leading edge company.

I've been home-office, field sales for the last 11 years and some were concerned with my adjustment moving to an office culture, but it's been a great transition. Being in the office during the days when I'm not in front of customers has really shown the advantages of being together as a team. There are so many ad hoc conversations that have happened where being a remote employee, you'd miss out on."

I never dreamed I could enjoy work this much - it's hard to call it work. For those skeptics, I've been around the block with some top tier Chicagoland companies - they don't even compare to the culture, daily responsibilities. career mobility, and pay that you get here. You are absolutely surrounded by brilliant people that want nothing more than to help you learn and be successful. Team members are amazing to work with. Everyone works together."

The biggest pro's that I have found about this company is that it takes a tremendous amount of pride in being the best. The focus of ongoing training both internal & external is top notch. The hiring process is very engaged, thorough & challenging, even if you are referred, which lends to the talent that you work alongside. The job has grown my professional skill set ten fold, especially in my business & selling acumen. From a selling perspective I would describe the pay and OTE to be undersold and over delivered vs. other sales jobs that sell you on high OTE's that almost always fall short. Amazing culture, amazing job, selling a platform that is the world's most innovative and good pay is why I love working here."
7903,"-The people - everyone here is talented, driven, smart, fun, etc. I can't get over how much I'm learning from people in the same role, and even other roles a few seats away. -Really fun culture. Everyone wants to help, there's a ton of competition, but collaboration is priority #1. -Benefits are great, pay is excellent, office is in a great location downtown."

7914,"I've never been one to ""drink the kool-aid"" but it's hard not to considering the culture Salesforce has built. Having the ability to compete against the colleague next to, but at the same time collaborate, is hard to come by. Salesforce does a phenomenal job at caring for their customers, as well as their employees. There is so much room for growth and Salesforce empowers you to make this your career rather than a stepping stone. The best career decision I've ever made was coming onboard to Salesforce."

Everyone is willing to share solutions and help each other. - Communication and feedback are clear, in part because of our own technology, in part because of our culture. - Top-down, Marc and Keith care about people and our planet.

We share workloads when we need help. - We build enablement to teach each other at regular intervals, which scales our organization's productivity. Everyone has a specialty that we want to share."
8118,Have been working at Salesforce for 2 years. The company culture has definitely changed along with strategy but by and large the things that attracted me to the company still ring true: - Great benefits - Technology always on the cutting edge and pointed in the right direction - Get to work with A players - Collaboration is not just a catch phrase here ... work as a team is a mantra - Overall great customer base that likes the technology - Great product suite

8167,"Technology leader, with a culture that is focused on building great teams, developing people, ensuring they can pursue doing more than just the job (training, time allocated for charity) and very focused on customers. The company will continue to change, which is something that people struggle with."
8172,"Was debating between this company and a few other large tech companies in the bay area. Was blown away by the culture and people here. It sounds cliche, but the people here are really what made me choose SalesforceIQ. Everyone is social, intelligent, and extremely helpful. Onboarding has been smooth and the development pace is much faster than what you'd find in a traditional tech company. You get the best of both worlds within SalesforceIQ - a startup environment that has the stability of a large company. Compensation is highly competitive with the bay area. SalesforceIQ was definitely one of the best choice I've made."
8173,"- Lots of opportunity, you can make of it what you'd like, just reach out and grab things that interest you and inspire passion in your work. - Great culture of transparency, low politics, and honest feedback is valued and actioned on. - The company really listens to it's employees and customers alike. - Good benefits & compensation."
8179,"Salesforce is a great company with a great culture. The top leaders are all awesome and inspiring. I consider myself lucky to have worked in a company with very smart, talented and driven people."
8181,"I've spent over 8 years with Salesforce in various management and individual contributor roles, all customer or partner facing. Some of the pros: - vibrant, fast paced culture - smart, fun, aggressive colleagues - management is focused on latest tech trends and staying or becoming a leader for many of them - by and large, customers and partners are very positive about the technology - good benefits and perqs - hip urban culture at HQ - a chart-your-own-course mentality that rewards those who aggressively seek out the job they want and pursue it, or sometimes even create it"
8199,Their Ohana culture is REAL - the company functions as a family built on relationships. The company truly values Trust in their employees and extends that to their partners and customers. Benefits are excellent. I love that they encourage giving back to the community and actually support it by providing Volunteer Time Off for their employees. Check out their 1-1-1 philanthropic model.
8200,"I was impressed with the company culture and branding with onboarding, orientation, and conferences. The company uses software to automate business processes to simplify administrative functions. The company is able to leverage analytics to drive data-driven decision maker. I enjoyed the focus on learning in the company and the ability to align with goals. The company leverages the platform to ensure communication and information sharing. A focus on customer success."
8206,"The Ohana culture at Salesforce is truly unparalleled. You will often hear Marc Benioff state, ""Business is one of the greatest platforms for change"". This statement resonates with me most because we really do live this mantra in every way - internally and externally. We are encouraged to give back to our communities and support our schools (often referred to as the future leaders of the world). We support non-profit organizations and the list of good will we do goes on and on. We help our customers connect with their customers in a whole new way - making a positive impact on their business. We truly are setting the bar for how all Companies should impact positive change in our world. With all of these pros, it is no wonder that we are the # 1 Workplace in the World and I am so happy to be a part of an amazing organization."
8211,"Salesforce fosters a motivated, hard-working environment. You are surrounded by extremely intelligent people and there is huge opportunity to learn in order to better yourself both personally and professionally. Great company culture, friendly employees, great environment overall."
8220,"The best product by far...bar none. The best visionaries, technical ops (the guys that keep the platform up and running), and internal platform engineers on the planet - these are the guys that deserve all the glory. What is done behind the scenes to keep the app going is nothing short of amazing - several million concurrent users while constantly adding functionality and innovating...and no down time? Come on. It's ridiculous. The tenured and long-timers that are still around are incredible. They're not only the best in the company, they're the best in the industry. Prove yourself to them and they will take care of you. If YOU have the drive and the ability, you can build a career path in the company...and if YOU make a case and have something behind it, it's one of the few companies in the world that will allow you to do so. Salesforce will not give you a map when you're hired that shows you a career path...but if you succeed in the role you're giving and prove yourself and earn trust, they'll actually allow you to create your own. The culture of the company is like nothing else in the world. Yes...you are expected to work more than anywhere else in the world...but if you like philanthropy, no questions asked...go do it - on company time. The best in the business keep coming on board. Marc is the best CEO in the business - different for sure - but the best. For a few years I thought the company had plateaued...several different times (at $750M...at $1B..at $2B...)...but I really do see this company making it to $10B in rev and beyond. Without a doubt. So if you're considering joining Salesforce but are worried about growth, don't be. That should be the last of your concerns."
8223,Great company culture that offers strong support for new employees as well as on-going training. They sponsor numerous employee events and are heavily involved in volunteering and non-profits.

8227,I am working for Salesforce for the past 3 years. So far I have not seen any valid point for me to make a move to another company. - Compensation is good compared to its equivalent companies - Great benefits and perks - Work-life balance is very good - Management helps employees to grow in their career - More innovative projects coming up which gives me a chance to learn the emerging technologies - Company does a lot of volunteering activities to support the society and people in need of help - Great culture and values which is why I hope this company is rated as the best place to work

I don't know how they've been able to retain this culture for almost 20 years but it is definitely working! Salesforce does care about its workforce as a whole and every member of the family individually."

The past 3 years in the ECS team has been incredible, both on a personal and professional level. I have made friends for life because the culture within this team is without a doubt a family unit. On a professional level, I have had my ups and downs for sure (I'm in sales, it wouldn't be natural if I didn't), but under the fantastic leadership, I have been educated, trained & coached into the salesperson I am today. I have learned so much over the past 3 years and will be forever grateful for the opportunity.

The leaders in my business unit have a really good vision, but could do better to communicate it downward all the way to the ICs."

This is true for how we care for our customers, employees and the communities and world we live in. It’s truly remarkable to see 17,000 people rowing in the same direction. From “Day 1” to today I continue to be impressed. Growth and innovation run through the DNA of the company. Which gives it the feeling of a 16-year-old start up & creates exciting opportunities for individual career growth. Exciting to work for a company with this type of trajectory. Performance of our industry-leading products results in very happy customers. And our customer list represents the world’s greatest brands in every industry vertical. The culture is unlike any other company I’ve worked for. As a sales person, it’s great to know we view “sales is a team sport” and “no one wins or loses alone”.

It's great where you know that stuff is taken care of and you can focus on getting the customers to where they want to go.

Work IN the city - no commute! Incredibly passionate CEO who in the 5 years I've been at Salesforce where I've watched us grow from 5K to 20K employees, he STILL replies to personal emails from employees. He's amazing. His enthusiasm is infectious. And his philanthropic passion is admirable. Flexible work environment - easy to WFH if necessary without feeling like you're missing out. Camaraderie among team and company - on a global scale. Travel - just recently I was asked to go to Japan. Incredible experience immersing myself into our office there and really getting to know the culture and people who up until then, was all conducted remotely.

The company treats people right. There is no emphasis on constant evaluation like you see at companies like Microsoft and Amazon. The result is that the employees are self-motivated to be productive and innovative and collaborative. Benefits are excellent, including receiving pay for volunteer work you do for nonprofits.
