8,"Salesforce has posted the benefits its offers employees online so I will not cover those here. What I want to share is Salesforce actually walks the walk when they say they support employees to find a work life balance especially where family is concerned. Over and over again I have been able to flex my schedule to meet family obligations. The on-going pandemic has really brought to the fore front the huge advantage of SalesForce as a company that actually support employees. Recently I needed to drop a project to be with a sick parent. Working with my manager I was able to be there with my family without thinking about work.The only feedback I received from my manager was ""go be with family and there is no project that supersedes that"""

They appear woke, but are generally respectful to those who are not. They are continuously working on their processes that need work (constantly sending out surveys and requesting blunt opinions). They even have us actively working on self improvement and advancement, even if it's lateral."

585,"Work life balance Training - broad range of business related topics €5K education fund per year Freedom/ Trust to do your job Career Progression/ development Excellent benefits package 6 Paid volunteering days a year Honestly, I have been working technology for over a decade now and my time at salesforce has been really positive. There are tonnes of technology jobs on offer around Dublin but from speaking with friends in other companies - salesforce offer one of the best opportunities to grow your career and bank balance. Don't get me wrong - I have seen some people take on the role of SMB and within 6 months it's obvious that they just aren't a good fit for technology solution selling. I personally have had to work my behind off and thankfully this year I'll be getting promoted to MM and I really look forward to the challenge ahead of me. If your considering a job with salesforce ask yourself 1. Do I want to work for the worlds most innovative tech company? 2. Does it matter if management really encourage me to give back to the local community and do some rewarding charity work? (It's real and trust me - you'll be overwhelmed by how good it feels) 3. Is career development really that important? 4 Could i spend €5K per year educating myself? 5. Would I enjoy working for a company that has a work hard/ play hard buzz? If yes is the answer then I really don't know of a better gig than salesforce.... FYI - the reason I'm using this forum right now is because my manager just did me a huge favour regarding my current promotion and this is my way of balancing the Karma!! it was either that or buy the guy some whiskey - this is the cheaper option :-)"

742,"In my late forties. I've been working in mid-sized software companies since mid-90's. Hired in Jan 2017. Wish I had found this place years ago! - Culture: in most companies, people roll their eyes when this word is used. Not at Salesforce. The spirit of giving back to the local community is strong. The spirit of wanting to do the right thing for the customer is SUPER strong. And the spirit of wanting their employees to succeed and move up is strong. - Pay/Bennies: better than I've gotten elsewhere. - Mgmt: I love my manager. He expects the very best of me, genuinely cares about my work/life balance, and doesn't micro-manage. Lots of opps for my career growth. - Co-workers: the politics are here, but not nearly as strong as other companies. I love my team of 12 people. - Wellness: if you're into Mindfulness, this is your job. Strong mindfulness community, if you look for it."

964,"I've been at Salesforce for several years now after coming from one of the big 4 consulting firms, and it's been night and day! Although I was a top performer at my previous company, it was clear that I was disposable to them regardless and they would rather hire someone with less experience than try to retain me (my requests were not related to salary, but changes to projects and overall happiness). I provided a lot of feedback on how to improve processes and promote collaborative culture as other coworkers were feeling similarly, but nothing was done. At Salesforce, I completely feel as if I'm heard by management. I've transferred to several different teams with ease (in fact, after one year at the company they encourage it and create programs to shadow other roles). My managers are genuinely interested in progressing my career and enabling me to succeed and I've enjoyed working with all the teams I've been on. I've had a lot of flexibility to ensure I still have a nice work/life balance and that I actually get to use all the perks available! I personally use all of the $100 gym membership stipend (you can use it for massages too if you don't work out!) and the generous VTO balance (56 hours to volunteer at my local animal shelter, yes please!)."

Management in my chain at least does a really good job of making sure not to overload anyone with to much work and makes it a point to get feedback about work/life balance every other week at the end of sprints. Not to repeat to much other information but benefits overall are very good and compensation seems to be top of market.
1047,"Salesforce, as a whole, is by far the best company I could wish to work for. It was my dream company to work for, mainly because of the culture. Beyond the in-house perks, there’s the 56 hours a year we are given to volunteer and give back in pretty much anyway you see fit. The benefits are superior to any company I’ve worked for. The buildings are a pleasure to work in each day. They focus on wellness and striking a good work-life balance. And in all earnesty, want to, and do give back to our communities."

2169,"Quality work/life balance - This is baked into the benefits and culture. Although, you need a manager that actually supports this for you. If you have that it is great but, when you don't it can feel defeating. Personally, I have experienced the good and the bad with this. Training - Trailhead is a wonderful tool that provides a great introduction to many products/services. It's self-guided and you can pursue what interests you at your own pace. Time off to volunteer - Again a great benefit but, your manager has to be supportive of your endeavors. Employees are encouraged to give back using the 1/1/1 model. On one hand you are praised if you meet or exceed the number of hours you give back. If you don't have a manager or a team that does a lot of volunteer work, you might be criticized or singled out for ""wasting time."" Free Snacks - This is nice when you need a 3:00 snack or can't get out for lunch. Access to great perks - Wellness activities, a gym, workout classes, a benefit you can use to pay for massages. Unlimited vacation time, sometimes free tickets to events."

Being entirely remote (because of COVID) since beginning, there is good work/life balance.

4708,Ohana Challenging and interesting work Work life balance
4730,"- Benefits here are incredible. Bonus, stock options (both RSUs and ESPP), generous 401k policy, plenty of PTO, 3 months of paternal leave (even more for mothers), sit/stand desks, free snacks / drinks, free food pretty often - Work/life balance is not perfect but a big step above other companies I have worked for. Your free time is for the most part respected (emergencies non-withstanding) and in my experience no one feels judged for using their PTO or VTO. - Many companies talk the talk in terms of diversity, but Salesforce walks the walk. They famously fought discriminatory laws in Indianapolis and unilaterally gave raises to ensure female employees were paid at the same rate as their male counterparts (without forcing pay cuts on anyone). They also strive to have a diverse board of directors, though I think this still needs work. - All full-time employees receive 7 paid days off (in addition to normal PTO) to pursue volunteer opportunities - and, again, this is actively encouraged. - Most managers do not have a ton of direct reports, meaning you can build a good relationship with your manager. - Career changes are not only permitted but encouraged. Some areas of the company have annual job fairs for lateral moves if you are not happy. In my case, my manager started to talk with me about where I want my career to go before I had even started to consider it. - Right now, great job security as the company is growing like crazy - which is great if you're used to consulting work."

4749,"Core benefits are good. Healthcare options seem competitive and are always looking to make better. The people you meet won’t all be so difficult. You’ll get the opportunity to volunteer and do some real good for someone else. I noticed if you have a family or are looking to start one, that the work life balance is probably your best benefit. However, such a good balance can often times appear to make individuals seem lazy and have little to no motivation to work quickly. That in turn has a trickle down effect to the rest of the teams who want to work quickly and build product."

6002,"Salesforce is a great place to work, for a lot of people a lot of the time. My perspective is mostly from consulting services/CSG, but there are some things that apply across the board. -Excellent focus on work/life balance. Better than anywhere else I've found in terms of consulting or engineering jobs. -Excellent salary. My title maps to ""senior manager"" level as an individual contributor, and all things considered I am extremely satisfied with it. -Health insurance is excellent, in terms of coverage/cost/options. One of the better plans I've seen. -401(k) is excellent if you're an investing wonk. The match tops out at $5k which is middle-of-the-pack, and the plan is through Fidelity (meh) with which you get a good selection of funds, but more importantly, BrokerageLink to invest in the wider markets, and the ability to contribute after-tax beyond the 402(g) limit and auto-convert to Roth with 1 phone call to set this up. This is relatively new in the marketplace, and still rare. Tl;dr is you can contribute as much as $52,000 to your plan for 2020 and characterize as Roth in the end, not $19,500, regardless of your age (research ""Mega Backdoor Roth""), which is a huge benefit for financial planning for highly-compensated employees. -Working for Salesforce comes with a lot of cachet within the world of software vendors and partners, and access to awesome tools and information. If you've been a consultant or worked for an ISV and geek out to the product, you're going to love it here, and often be able to get involved with really interesting clients, projects, and internal initiatives shaping future product development."

8047,"I've been with Salesforce for several years and it just keeps getting better. The leadership team continues to strive for improvements overall with the culture, quality of talent, and dedicated core values around wellness, equality, fun, and work-life balance."
8049,"This is a great company to work for in a very exciting time in the industry. It is a leader in its field of business which makes for an exciting opportunity before you even get to the front door. There is a healthily vibrant atmosphere in the company, a word-hard/play-hard attitude and a decent respect for work-life balance. The company is growing fast and there are a ton of opportunities to raise your career profile, move departments and discover more about your skills and abilities in the workplace."
8052,"I had competitive offers from multiple companies, but I decided to go with Salesforce for a few reasons. What stuck out during the hiring process was: 1) I was a real person to Salesforce, and I really mattered. At another company in the Bay Area (which is widely considered to be *the* most prestigious company to work for... no specifics, but it's a search engine that starts with a G), I had an interviewer call me 1 hour late for an interview and 15 minutes late for the rescheduled interview, on top of telling me that their interview process was 6-8 weeks long and was totally inflexible. At Salesforce, on the other hand, every interview started right on the dot of the scheduled time and the hiring process was just under 3 weeks from beginning to end. I had to have special accommodations and stay an extra night after the interview due to a disability that makes it difficult to travel late at night, and they extended my hotel booking without any question. 2) All the employees are passionate about their work. This is because of a system called Open Opportunity Market where you are allowed to leave your team and join any other team with an open spot during releases. Basically, everyone does the job that they want and nobody is stuck in a role they hate. 3) Everyone is super friendly. My interviewers all asked me if I was comfortable, if I needed a break/anything to drink/a snack. Now that I'm here, I'm happy with the decision I made. I think my favorite thing about the company is that they are very open to change. Management really, really listens to what everyone wants, whether it's a change in development process or better snacks in the kitchen. The work/life balance is great - you can work remotely as often as you'd like and you can come in/leave whenever as long as you're productive. There's catered lunches all the time and a full-service coffee shop in the office. The parties are great (I was second row to see Metallica at a company party 2 weeks after I joined!) and the people are awesome."
8074,"I have been in the IT industry for the 20 years and worked for multiple consulting companies and I feel Salesforce is one of the best companies which focus on work life balance, employee first strategy and employee growth."

Meetings are highly efficient and productive. Managers are understanding and make an effort to support your goals - both personal and professional. Work-life balance exists here. People typically work 9am-5pm, with the occasional long days of 8am to 6 or 7pm. The snacks are also great - free LaCroix, popcorn, greek yogurt, coconut water, fruit, hummus, chocolate-covered pretzels, cereal, etc. Also, the cafes are amazing!"
