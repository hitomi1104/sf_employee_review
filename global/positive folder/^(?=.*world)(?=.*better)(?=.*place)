792,- Excellent training - Outstanding company culture that is focused on customer success and making the world a better place - Colleagues are extremely helpful and collaborative
1261,"Woven into the culture of Salesforce is both the strong desire to make the world a better place and the enabling of each employee to do exactly that. Volunteer time isn't a once-a-year event; it's seven full days of paid volunteer time every fiscal year. Colleagues (at least within my rather large extended team) are incredibly helpful. At least part of the reason is that we're encouraged to work cross-group, avoiding the ""silo"" effect. Salesforce invests heavily in maintaining its distinct culture as it grows rapidly."

3332,"rom the beginning, Salesforce sought to make the world a better place through technology that builds stronger relationships. Between companies and their customers or between employees and their teams; Salesforce was founded with three foundational core values: 1. Trust, Salesforce wins through transparency, security, compliance, privacy and performance the trust of customers, employees and extended families. 2. Innovation, innovation is not only reflected in the design of software, but also includes encouraging employees to innovate within the company, encouraging employees to use their imagination, and allowing each employee to use their imagination to create miracles. 3. Equality, Salesforce believes that everyone should be seen, heard, valued and empowered to succeed, and listening to each employee's different perspectives fosters innovation, deepens human connections, and enables Salesforce becomes a better company. Salesforce has also built an employee communication site, where employees can speak up, make their own suggestions and the company's shortcomings."

6002,"Salesforce is a great place to work, for a lot of people a lot of the time. My perspective is mostly from consulting services/CSG, but there are some things that apply across the board. -Excellent focus on work/life balance. Better than anywhere else I've found in terms of consulting or engineering jobs. -Excellent salary. My title maps to ""senior manager"" level as an individual contributor, and all things considered I am extremely satisfied with it. -Health insurance is excellent, in terms of coverage/cost/options. One of the better plans I've seen. -401(k) is excellent if you're an investing wonk. The match tops out at $5k which is middle-of-the-pack, and the plan is through Fidelity (meh) with which you get a good selection of funds, but more importantly, BrokerageLink to invest in the wider markets, and the ability to contribute after-tax beyond the 402(g) limit and auto-convert to Roth with 1 phone call to set this up. This is relatively new in the marketplace, and still rare. Tl;dr is you can contribute as much as $52,000 to your plan for 2020 and characterize as Roth in the end, not $19,500, regardless of your age (research ""Mega Backdoor Roth""), which is a huge benefit for financial planning for highly-compensated employees. -Working for Salesforce comes with a lot of cachet within the world of software vendors and partners, and access to awesome tools and information. If you've been a consultant or worked for an ISV and geek out to the product, you're going to love it here, and often be able to get involved with really interesting clients, projects, and internal initiatives shaping future product development."

7112,"I've been working at Salesforce for over 10 years, and continue to be impressed with Salesforce as an organisation and the people we employ - smart, hard-working people. Salesforce is a great place to work with tremendous opportunity to learn and grow, great benefits and lots of great perks. I feel privileged to work not only for a high-paced, innovative company who has been a pioneer in it's field since 1999, but one that also has strong values and does it's part to make the world a better place. At an individual level, we are encouraged to volunteer in our community (we get 56 hours of volunteer time off per year) but on a company-wide level, our leaders have taken stands to improve the state of the world. One of the more recent examples is spending $3M to erase the gender pay gap internally."
