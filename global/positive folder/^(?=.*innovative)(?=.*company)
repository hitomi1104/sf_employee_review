It is extremely fast paced, what else would you expect from such an innovative company, one of the many reasons I love Salesforce."

585,"Work life balance Training - broad range of business related topics €5K education fund per year Freedom/ Trust to do your job Career Progression/ development Excellent benefits package 6 Paid volunteering days a year Honestly, I have been working technology for over a decade now and my time at salesforce has been really positive. There are tonnes of technology jobs on offer around Dublin but from speaking with friends in other companies - salesforce offer one of the best opportunities to grow your career and bank balance. Don't get me wrong - I have seen some people take on the role of SMB and within 6 months it's obvious that they just aren't a good fit for technology solution selling. I personally have had to work my behind off and thankfully this year I'll be getting promoted to MM and I really look forward to the challenge ahead of me. If your considering a job with salesforce ask yourself 1. Do I want to work for the worlds most innovative tech company? 2. Does it matter if management really encourage me to give back to the local community and do some rewarding charity work? (It's real and trust me - you'll be overwhelmed by how good it feels) 3. Is career development really that important? 4 Could i spend €5K per year educating myself? 5. Would I enjoy working for a company that has a work hard/ play hard buzz? If yes is the answer then I really don't know of a better gig than salesforce.... FYI - the reason I'm using this forum right now is because my manager just did me a huge favour regarding my current promotion and this is my way of balancing the Karma!! it was either that or buy the guy some whiskey - this is the cheaper option :-)"

Salesforce is a great place to work with tremendous opportunity to learn and grow, great benefits and lots of great perks. I feel privileged to work not only for a high-paced, innovative company who has been a pioneer in it's field since 1999, but one that also has strong values and does it's part to make the world a better place. At an individual level, we are encouraged to volunteer in our community (we get 56 hours of volunteer time off per year) but on a company-wide level, our leaders have taken stands to improve the state of the world. One of the more recent examples is spending $3M to erase the gender pay gap internally."

7902,"I have been at Salesforce for over a year and the experience has been nothing short of outstanding. The biggest pro's that I have found about this company is that it takes a tremendous amount of pride in being the best. The focus of ongoing training both internal & external is top notch. The hiring process is very engaged, thorough & challenging, even if you are referred, which lends to the talent that you work alongside. The job has grown my professional skill set ten fold, especially in my business & selling acumen. From a selling perspective I would describe the pay and OTE to be undersold and over delivered vs. other sales jobs that sell you on high OTE's that almost always fall short. Amazing culture, amazing job, selling a platform that is the world's most innovative and good pay is why I love working here."
7962,"I've worked at Salesforce for approximately 18 months. Overall, I love the spirit of the company. Very energetic, team-based atmosphere. Strong, smart workforce.

8227,I am working for Salesforce for the past 3 years. So far I have not seen any valid point for me to make a move to another company. - Compensation is good compared to its equivalent companies - Great benefits and perks - Work-life balance is very good - Management helps employees to grow in their career - More innovative projects coming up which gives me a chance to learn the emerging technologies - Company does a lot of volunteering activities to support the society and people in need of help - Great culture and values which is why I hope this company is rated as the best place to work
8267,"Unbelievable products and culture. Customers, in general, love us. The most innovative company in the world (Forbes) three years running. This is the place to be, and we are moving into new territory daily."

8707,Truely thinking for the customer and keep producing innovative products. I always inspired by the company's value.
8984,Health insurance and education allowance; the product is great and it really is the most innovative company out there from a tech perspective
9215,"A fast growing, innovative company. Full of smart, intelligent, caring people. Really lives the core values of ""Trust, Customer Success, Innovation and Equality"" in a way that I have never seen in any other company that I have worked for. I love the 1+1+1 philanthropy and way every employee embraces this. From the CEO down people liv the values, publicly express those values and passionately care for the customers success. It is a fun, exciting and vibrant place to work. You get swept along with the raw energy of working here. Senior managers walk the talk and this is learning culture, You work hard and play hard and have a lot of fun on the way. There are not many companies in the world who have a weekly all hands call that thousands tune in to, the CEO and leadership team attend, and nearly always has a major Hollywood, business or musical star as part of the event!"

9473,"Amazing company, leadership, values, innovative. Best career move!! Highly recommend a career at Salesforce"
9492,"Amazing company to work for - fast paced, innovative, very focused on customer success & happy employees"
9507,Smart people and big challenging problems to solve in engineering. People are allowed to be innovative and take chances. Focus on giving back (1:1:1) is pervasive throughout the company.
9508,"Volunteerism, flexible hours, work from home, excellent management, great benefits, competitive salary, innovative company, great client base, prioritize client needs and employee needs, amazing coworkers"
9575,"It's great to work for the 800 pound gorilla. Does YOUR company have Stevie Wonder as the opening act of your CEO's keynote speech? Hmm? Everything about the company is world class. The benefits, the opportunities, the projects, the technology, and even the compensation for most roles. Some of the sales reps get a raw deal with territories, but if you're one of the lucky ones, you can really do well. Salesforce continues to lead the pack in innovative social policies. They were one of the first major companies to initiate a comprehensive review of female compensation, which is very much appreciated. Some women at the company received substantial raises, which one one hand is great, but on the other hand raises some uncomfortable questions."
9638,"Salesforce is growing at an amazing pace. The culture is fantastic in certain parts of the org. The technology is innovative and always changing. This is the place for you if you can take initiative, work hard, and grow/change with the company"
9666,"Fun, dynamic, great people, innovative. Great company and their philanthropic model is amazing. They definitely make it cool to work"
9722,"I have worked at several of the major software firms in the Seattle area in my career. Salesforce by far has the greatest culture. There is a lot of energy and passion you can feel in the air. The company treats people right. There is no emphasis on constant evaluation like you see at companies like Microsoft and Amazon. The result is that the employees are self-motivated to be productive and innovative and collaborative. Benefits are excellent, including receiving pay for volunteer work you do for nonprofits. They match donations you make, even those to your local church or synagogue."
