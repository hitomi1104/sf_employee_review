318,"- Trust - Extremely transparent to such an extent that I can see the goal settings of each and every employee of Salesforce. Feedbacks are given at the right time and finally, everyone strives to do better for the team rather than the individual. Innovation - Team thinks of at-least 8 years in advance when making the roadmap. Every engineer needs to have a certification in AI/ML by 2019. This is one amazing goal where the company has invested a lot of dollars. Customer intimacy - Never seen such customer stickiness in a long time. Growth is not measured in revenues alone but also in customer satisfaction and it is taken very seriously. Diversity - Absolutely zero politics so far. Engineers are given a fair chance in every respect of their day to day lives. Ethics is highly valued."

Equality, Salesforce believes that everyone should be seen, heard, valued and empowered to succeed, and listening to each employee's different perspectives fosters innovation, deepens human connections, and enables Salesforce becomes a better company. Salesforce has also built an employee communication site, where employees can speak up, make their own suggestions and the company's shortcomings."
