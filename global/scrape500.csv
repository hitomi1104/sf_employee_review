I got lucky and have an awesome manager. I also enjoy working remotely. Being able to contribute to Dreamforce is a plus. They definitely make an effort to be transparent and communicative here. If you have a cool idea, Salesforce is a place where you can often make it a reality.","Why is drinking such a big part of the company culture? It saddens me that even a below-21 intern feels he/she can't participate fully in the ""culture"" because drinking is such a ""big part"" of it, as seen in a recent Glassdoor review. I don't drink for health reasons, and I often feel like work events (holiday parties, team celebrations, Dreamforce) are less rewarding for me because the non-alcoholic choices are an afterthought. Can I have a $20 gift card instead?! I've seen a lot of employees misbehaving and embarrass themselves through alcohol. Time to cut back. Alcohol is not the same thing as a company culture. Second, I have no illusions that working remotely is a perfect situation. I know I miss out on a lot in the office and I am ok with it. That said, I think the company could do more to make Salesforce better for non-SF members of the Ohana. I also think there should be better career paths for those who are not managers. Because I'm remote, I have been told I don't have much room to move up since I can't manage remotely (even though my manager manages me remotely... and that seems to work fine). The company expects so much of us during Dreamforce (12+ hour days for a week), but we never see any time off as a result of that.",4 people found this review helpful

The company treated me well, both in terms of compensation and the flexibility they allowed me to exercise when working from home.","Broken promises: I was assured when I came on-board that the job was a contract-to-hire, but after the initial contract period was over, I was extended on the same contract and told that no full-time would be available. I was also told upon my initial visit to the office that I'd be visiting the office in-person several times a year, but after 7 months, there is no repeat visit on the horizon, so I feel very disconnected from the team. The only thing we actually do is build a web app that helps people send out marketing e-mails. I was excited about being part of something big that sets the industry standard, but I eventually figured out that couldn't care less for the company's product. My manager was changed halfway through my contract to a person who is a great coder but who has virtually no management experience, and she had two modes: ignore me completely and tell me everything is great, or micromanage my work with a critical eye and tell me I am going too slow and I don't deserve to bill for a full week. It didn't seem like she was capable of paying attention in a way that was really supportive. The last complaint I have is that priority decisions were made in a very top-down way without an intelligent eye on the effectiveness of work that's being done. Lots of automation coverage was built around medium to low priority test cases that were decided arbitrarily, while outstanding known defects and other important things were ignored.",8 people found this review helpful
79,Toxic work environment and culture,"Apr 27, 2017 - Anonymous Employee",2.0,- Marc Benioff is a great CEO - Building tallest new building on west coast - Training - Commitment to philanthropy 1:1:1 model - Good office location,"Management - Many Managers, Few Leaders - Moral is low. Few are making quota. Micro management is pervasive. Management wants to own all the deals and tell AE's what to do and how to do it. There is no trust in the AE's ability to drive a deal to close. Management attempts to drive rep behavior by fear and focusing too much on the volume of activity. There is a lack of focus on being out in territory vs volume of remote calls / meetings. Management needs to do a better job of using the app to reference next steps and activity. AE's are asked to repeat what is already in the app and often a waste of time and meetings. Quota Attainment and Resources - Very few people are hitting quota and throwing more bodies at the problem is not solving it. We are short of SE's and SE management. We have way too many co-primes units and need to dissolve the service cloud co-prime role. GB and Select comp plan is not aligned to a ""monthly cadence"" and only can make , few people are achieving quota and management is terrible. Management constantly complaining to reps about activity, expense reports or closed business. Monthly cadence for sales isn't aligned to the comp plan for GB and Select roles. A lot of politics. Limited Work Life Balance and Always on Call - We are not doctors or solving the world's most important problems. We are sales reps for a tech company. We should not be on call every night, weekend and on PTO. Reps are NOT encourage to take time away to re-energized and refocus. When reps try to take time off, they are getting daily emails from management. Managers Get Unlimited PTO / Reps Get Very Limited PTO - Managers not get unlimited PTO due to a policy change in April 2017 where Director level and above (management) get unlimited PTO, Meanwhile AE reps are limited to about 2 weeks of PTO and still filling out weekly time sheets! Everyone should be on the same policy - unlimited PTO. Credit on Deals - Another example of the politics and toxic culture is having another AE get credit and commission credit for a large deal they did not do any work on. This impacts the moral, work environment, and obviously commission. Management often overlooks doing the right thing and being inflexible.",8 people found this review helpful
80,"Tech & Product Org - Great Work Environment, Poor on Diversity","Jun 1, 2017 - Product",3.0,"Salesforce pays well in salary/commission/equity, give employees a flexible and generally fun culture, provides a generally transparent work environment and is clearly at a growing, destination company with a visionary leader. The culture of volunteerism and giving back is in the fabric of the company and is something that is almost mandated that people do in their communities in ways that they think is best and fulfills their passion to give back. Salesforce's stand on many macro issues from LGBT rights in Indianapolis, Georgia and North Carolina to equal pay for women are highly laudable and amazing to feel you are a part of in some small way. Some of the leaders at Salesforce from Marc Benioff to many of his deputies are truly inspirational people and there is a sense that you are at times in a once in a lifetime role which does feel special","Diversity Being a white male is a much better chance of moving up and certainly moving up at a more rapid pace or getting to any VP+ role. The ranks of non caucasians across the board in senior roles is small and you can see that the diversity racial numbers are largely inflated by lower level employees. Certainly there has been strides in recent years for diversity and upward mobility for women but by and large this is just white women. Ultimately the saddest part to it is that while Salesforce hired a non white person to lead diversity, his role has largely been symbolic and for external macro political reasons. As tangible cases of diversity issues have arisen on an individual employee basis, invariably it has been the side of the tenured white Salesforce leader who has won the day. Being an employee of color is frustrating at Salesforce because over time things do become patronizing as you are told if you do A, B or C you will increase your chances of getting a reward or a promotion. Yet clearly others do none of the above and those same rewards come their way. Writing this may sound like sour grapes but ultimately the numbers don't lie with employee diversity numbers across the board in middle to senior roles as well as tenure to promotion ratios for whites vs. non whites. Salesforce is not alone in tech let alone the wider corporate culture with this issue. However it is a company that prides itself on being progressive here and it really is not when it comes to employees within the company. Diversity is not a PR headline as we so often seek, it is actually people's lives.",5 people found this review helpful

I've told my story unbiased to several other managers and co-workers, and they ALL agree that I was really given a raw deal. I was never given any solid opportunities to sharpen my Marketing Cloud skill-set, and the opportunities I was given (working on Accelerators) I excelled at. Every feedback received from customers (via Accelerators) and co-workers alike was nothing less than extraordinary. However, none of this mattered for some reason. I've kept a document that noted every piece of feedback received just in case I had to have something to back my story up with. I feel, along with others, that my manager had a personal vendetta against me and was working to get me dismissed. I was never given opportunities to work on real Marketing Cloud projects therefore, couldn't really get some good feedback going from that perspective. I was given the bare minimum to work with and often, I was left without work to do. In the end, I got tired of this treatment and began looking for other opportunities that really valued what I brought to the table.

""Born cloud"" really does matter, and it shows in the growth of the business. With success comes excellent, top of market compensation, top-notch offices, great systems and support to do your job well.","Salesforce is surprisingly political, especially when you consider how the brand is fun and there's a genuine ""do good"" ethos of philanthropy at the company. Salesforce attracts high performers, which is great in many ways but also leads to a very ""type A"" aggressive, win-at-all-cost environment. Add on top of that the fact that Marc likes to make multiple bets and encourage internal competition (it's why there are two customer service products that sometimes directly compete, two salesforce automation products, etc.). So you end up with a workplace culture that, while exceedingly positive and gracious on the surface, is actually quite cut-throat and reliant on personal connections over merit. I saw multiple examples of mid-level managers making decisions based on what would most impress the boss over what was best for the company, let alone the customer. There's an obsession with BSOs (Big Shiny Objects) that cost a fortune and have little impact on the business but can be touted internally in presentations to leadership.",26 people found this review helpful

127,The Star Rating Says it All,"Jan 17, 2015 - Anonymous Employee in Portland, OR",2.0,"1. The company does offer some great opportunity for upward movement, which is great for those who are looking to begin or enhance their careers. 2. The benefits are pretty good. 3. Within the workplace there are a lot of amenities that other employers do not, i.e. food, drinks (non-alcoholic), and the occasional catered event is nice too. But on the other hand, this is all fluff.","Unfortunately there are a lot more Cons then there are Pros, which is a reflection of the location I was at: 1. The Management in Technical Support could use some Management training. Call Center management is well known for creating drama, poor morale, and inconsistency within the workplace. 2. The Managers create a toxic environment by not caring about employee welfare and falsifying information to employees. The company prides itself in transparency, but it doesn't seem that, that is the case. 3. If your not based in the headquarters office, it is extremely difficult to move into a new position, especially when your Managers has little to no interest in helping you grow professionally. 4. Employees are not held to the same standard as their peers. If your Manager likes you, you can get away with whatever you want. If he/she doesn't like you, you should plan on finding a new job as they will lie to upper management. 5. Upon starting a position with Salesforce, do not expect training because you're not going to get it. They would rather have you slave away fixing their previous mistakes, rather than properly train you to be efficient and knowledgeable about the product. The ramping up process is an absolute joke and an insult! 6. There is not one Manager who can do your job. None of the Manager's know the Salesforce platform or have any technical aptitude. 7. It is easy to get burnt out. For example 10 of the 12 months of my employment has consisted of 50 hour work weeks, full of insane workloads and the pressure to maintain specific metrics. They will squeeze every last bit of sanity and work out of you and all you get in return is the Managers cooking breakfast for you, which is an insult. Not only can they not manage, but they're also terrible cooks as well. 8. There is a lot of self-serving people in Technical Support and on Account Management teams. Rather than being one united team, people only look out for themselves and will quickly step on your toes if it suits them. 9. Your peers may appear to be on your side and want to make positive change with you. But they will be quick to stab you in the back if it means they will get in trouble.. Major lack of ""testinal fortitude"". 10.The morale in the office is equivalent to a prison. 11. As a Manager you should leave personal opinions and judgments at the door. 12. You can be extremely lazy, but have a good attitude and you will be treated like a top tier employee. If your a top performer but have the occasional bad day due to the high work volume and terrible workplace environment, your career will not flourish. 13. Managers are never available. And when they are, if you have questions or concerns, it is a huge convenience for them. 14. The platform UI is straight out of 2005. Who uses i-Frames anymore? 15. There's a lack of tools and resources available to do our jobs and Management will tell you the resources are coming, but they never do. Of if you do get them, it is too little, too late. 16. The company has lost its vision.. Being innovative doesn't involve buying other platforms/software and integrating it into your own. It is creating the product on your own.",7 people found this review helpful

143,Beware the Salt Lake City office - otherwise great,"May 24, 2017 - Anonymous Employee in Salt Lake City, UT",3.0,"Overall, the Salesforce culture is great. They practice what they preach. There is a good work-life balance. Where I ding them on the overall score is based on the Salt Lake City office.",Salesforce tends to acquire with little emphasis on actually integrating behind the scenes outside of the products - something exacerbated by them acquiring Demandware when the dust of Demandware acquiring Tomax hadn't yet settled. The Salt Lake City office has a very different vibe than other Demandware or Salesforce locations. There are some passive aggressive personalities in it due to some painfully obvious coddling by prior (and some present) management. Many hold job titles that are not at parity with industry guidelines and somehow think that they are 'special' when they wouldn't survive a month in that role elsewhere. People tend to withhold information whether it's dodging questions they know the answers to or refusing to document things because they view themselves as more valuable with secrets locked in their heads. For the technical professional who wants to come in and get things accomplished the SLC office culture will wear on you. It is the opposite of collaborative except for a few key people working hard to change the dynamic.,10 people found this review helpful

154,Worried about Dot Org as we grow and scale,"Mar 3, 2019 - Strategic Account Manager",3.0,"We love our vision and mission in higher ed/non profit! If you rock at sales and love academia, then dot org is the place to be! So much growth since I started with dot org three years ago, and lots of new people coming on board with the high growth!","New AEs or people considering coming to dot org – there is a caveat and buyer beware! It’s starting to feel like a sink-or-swim culture with so many new people coming onboard. I’ve been asked to work with numerous new AEs as they stepped into their role since fall/December of 2018. It’s become very clear that we are not taking the right steps to onboard them. New AEs are overwhelmed with the boundless options and tools we give them. Not to mention, for December hires, their RVPs were busy closing FY ’19 business, so our most vulnerable new hires were left to fend for themselves. Hopefully, they’ll get RVP support once FY ’20 kicks off. Bottom line: our intentions are good, but our execution fails them. It’s interesting that we constantly, almost self-righteously, talk about “the pace of Salesforce” as if it’s a badge of honor that only a few can achieve. Most new AEs coming into higher ed want to achieve and catch onto this pace right away. However, unfortunately we’re sabotaging their success by everything we throw at them (and again, often without RVP support). The enablement and RVP teams need to do better jobs of sequencing and blocking off the new hire content. Instead, we are throwing everything plus the kitchen sink at them – all at once – and expecting them to make sense of it all. No wonder I get panic-stricken phone calls and text messages at all hours of the day/night from rookies. Many RVPs are telling down their throats for answers, yet we haven’t paced their learning. In our current state of onboarding, I don’t know if even I could make it through this process given the “throw-it-all-at-them” approach we now take.",4 people found this review helpful

159,"I thought I had a career, but really I'm another peon in a call center.","Jul 1, 2014 - Anonymous Employee",2.0,"Benefits are great. The office is absolutely beautiful. There are always snacks, free food, events, beer, etc. Management can be pretty understanding when life happens and you need to take time off to take care of something.","A few months ago, there was a large surge of hiring. Most of the hires came from a third party vendor that was closing. Some of the new hires from this location were previously denied applicants. I discovered that these new employees were being hired in Senior positions over me, making more money than me, and were even given relocation bonuses that I was told I could not have when I relocated in the previous year to work for this company. When I was first hired, the interview process seemed incredibly difficult to get through. Once they had seats to fill, it became a mad dash to find anyone with any Salesforce experience to fill the seats, and they seemed to do anything to get those people here. I am now left feeling worthless and insignificant in my surroundings. My experience, hard work, and dedication to this company is now meshed into a field of call center employees dashing to meet metrics. On top of the new employees that were hired from this vendor, they also hired managers. I know that people take time to adjust, but these managers are killing our vibe. Salesforce prides itself on transparency. These managers keep secrets and treat employees like worker bees. We have had multiple interactions with upper management where they will talk about a big change, and act surprised when they find out that those of us at the bottom didn't know about the change. The new managers don't understand the need for work and life balance. We previously had options to work remotely when we were ill, or even having an off day. Where we were didn't matter as long as we were doing our jobs. Now, if you are sick and want to work from home, you are asked to take PTO (since you are not given Sick time, you need to use your vacation time)more often, which encourages sick people to come to work and spread their illness throughout the building. Talent seems to mean nothing here as well. It's all about how many years of service. I know of employees who don't put in the effort , who barely get their work done, and they are promoted because of how long they've been here, while I train other employees, mentor, and do still meet metrics, and I'm stuck at the same level. You report to a manager here, but good luck finding your manager if you need something. The Managers are presented as people managers, but when it really comes down to it, they are project managers. I end up doing many small tasks for my manager, that my manager doesn't have time to do, in order to keep my team running smoothly. By no means do I blame my manager for this, but they need to take some of this off their plates. They seem to work 24 hours a day. We recently had a huge push to get our case load down to a specific number. Our portion of the Organization spent 10 weeks squeezing every last drop out of every single one of us to close as many cases as possible. The communication that was sent out read as ""I know you are working hard and thank you for your efforts, but work harder"". After week 8, everyone around me was miserable. There were daily meltdowns from ""Analysts"" who were mad at customers for needing help, when the real problem was the amount of work they expected us to do, and the free time outside of work they expected us to sacrifice. Of course, management didn't see these meltdowns because they were off running Reports on metrics and trying to over analyze the reason behind xyz. When I first came here, I really thought that this was a career. It now feels now different than any call center or retail job I have worked in. This is the longest I've ever worked at a company without receiving a promotion.",6 people found this review helpful

Our group has become more fragmented and less collaborative. There's more fear of making mistakes and the general sense of trust and support for our work from our leadership has gone way down. The transparency and access we had upwards is becoming more hazy largely because of layers being added. My autonomy and empowerment to make decisions is slipping away. Politics were always there, but now they're something you have to consider daily. You used to be judged based on the work you created and what you shipped, it doesn't feel that way anymore. Some of my favorite people have already moved on. Perhaps it's just the nature of a company growing this fast. There's not a clear avenue for safely giving upwards feedback for our group.

Few are making quota. Micro management is pervasive. Management wants to own all the deals and tell AE's what to do and how to do it. There is no trust in the AE's ability to drive a deal to close. Management attempts to drive rep behavior by fear and focusing too much on the volume of activity. There is a lack of focus on being out in territory vs volume of remote calls / meetings. Management needs to do a better job of using the app to reference next steps and activity. AE's are asked to repeat what is already in the app and often a waste of time and meetings. Quota Attainment and Resources - Very few people are hitting quota and throwing more bodies at the problem is not solving it. We are short of SE's and SE management.

It's a highly collaborative, team-oriented environment. Leadership is highly respected, as they are not only smart and are visionaries, but are supportive. The majority of people here are simply 'nice' and good to work with.","As with any growth company, there are som immaturities - sometimes it feels as if we are making it up as we go, which can be good but can also pose challenges within a larger company the size of Salesforce.

They cater breakfast in Monday-Thursday and lunch on Monday. The area to bring clients at is GREAT! Clients dig it.,"This was the worst job I've ever had. Management talks down to you like I haven't been doing this for 10 years (and my boss has less experience with half the success).... And I was #1 on my team and #11 in the country. They claim compensation is great but when based in Atlanta you get the most bottom of the barrel accounts and this means everything (you have to deal with it). I've never worked so hard for a $2K deal... in. my. life. In my previous life, I never glimpsed at anything under $100K. That was for newer reps. If you sell a $100K deal, you will be at the top for the month and everyone freaks out. So what this means.... what they say you will get paid is a FAR stretch from reality. I was above my number and didn't make what they claimed because when I got my sales compensation package there are all these other factors. Therefore, I made SIGNIFICANTLY less here than my last job. The base was higher but that was it. I'm a hunter and have always been one. Here, it does NOT make sense to focus on hunting because you get new accounts every year and for a prospect to switch CRM's this decision isn't made overnight. Don't let the recruiter tell you otherwise. Trust me. Every current client that I did get, I had to do damage control from previous reps trying to squeeze every dollar out of them. The previous sales reps had their own agenda and it really hurt our clients. Because you get new accounts each year, the previous reps didn't care about the future. They did whatever it took to get $ and then dumped the client. I spent the first 6 months trying to get our clients not to leave us. The office is LOUD because the desk are on top of each other with no sound barriers and all the conference rooms are booked. Clients made many comments about the background noise and it's embarrassing.",41 people found this review helpful

Let's be honest, Midwest people are just some of nicest people around. If you live in Indy there are a lot of great opportunities The sincerity of leadership and the people quickly make you happy to go to work, I actually consider 90% of the people I worked with friends. If you manage your time and have a general interest in the technology there are tons of things to do. I've dabbled in product sessions, support workshop hours, custom app dev, etc. All while doing my day job. Because Indy is small most of the talented people in the area end up at ET. A lot of talent resides in the town, and the C level team strives to keep the company local.","Only Product jobs are in Indy. Comp is only great if you live in the Midwest, if you're hired to work in a remote office be prepared to work with clients of similar skills sets that will make a lot more than you. Benefits are not equal per locale, some offices get parking, food, gyms, subway passes, etc. Simply because that's the bare min to acquire people in that locale, too bad for you if you don't live there. PTO is really poor compared to our parent company SalesForce Benefits are not up to par with our parent company SalesForce, try to find ET benefits and then find SF benefits. You'll notice ET's benefits are impossible to find and SF brags about theirs. That should be your sign. If you're assigned to SOW in Services or Support, there is little to no incentive to move you into something challenging. Most changes are done because of attrition as the organization are pretty flat outside of product. Salary bands don't exist, or if they do they are very lax. It's common someone on your team negotiated really hard and someone just took a college entry job. HR still doesn't have a classification for all skill sets in the field.

The outside reputation of Salesforce being a cult are far overstated, but it does feel like the culture overall is a bit hodgepodge and unfocused.

The first 12 months are sink or swim, and aside from self-enabling yourself, the territories are hit or miss. Sales reps that have crushed their quota at other companies often struggle due to poor territory carves and slow enablement ramp time. Furthermore, Marketing Cloud basically acts as its own company within Salesforce. Collaboration with the CRM business is weak at best, and Marketing Cloud's biggest competitor has been its own internal solution, Pardot. Last, sales managers here are mostly just that, managers.
