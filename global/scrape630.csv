They lure in new employees and recent college grads with ""career development"" talk, time to study and get other certifications, job shadowing, etc. You quickly learn none of that will ever happen. Getting a tech support job in Hillsboro will NOT help you get another job in a different department or location -- it can only hinder you, if anything. They're also constantly pressuring employees into working overtime because they're understaffed, but don't want to hire. The pay doesn't match the pressure and stress.

If you're a team-focused, positive, cheerful, driven person, this is a company where you can make huge strides in a very short amount of time.","First, it's NOT a startup, and while the company seems to have a great future ahead, it's not a fast-growth place where you're going to get catered meals, massages, and toys to play with every day. This shouldn't be a problem, but since the HQ is in San Francisco, people are reminded of all the perks and opportunities that abound just around the corner (or in Silicon Valley). Also, while the company is a great place to work, it tends to favor extraverts and people who desire to move up or who want to do lots of things outside their current job role.

People talk about an effective work/life balance. Pardot employs it in a way I've never seen before. I believe it allows them to achieve a level of productivity equivalent to one generated from an 80 hour work week.

49,Nightmare on California Street and Freaked out on Fremont,,1.0,"Snacks. Smart people. Company does give back to the community but ironically, squashes their own people while serving the needy. Starting salary for Commercial AE was 100K. Overtime (that everyone lies about) is the only guarantee for additional income and that's only available since the class action lawsuit forced all Corporate Sales to become hourly employees--that happened in 2011.","Others have said it and I wholeheartedly agree. This was the worst professional experience of my career. Learned a lot about how truly horrible a company can treat their employees. Really hard to get a job here unless you know someone and I did--what I didn't know was how much I was lied to with the promise of making a living. The only people who are happy here are the young kids who are striving to achieve success early on in their careers and those who have been at the company for years who are favored and given the good patches to actually make their goal. Such an insidious culture with back stabbing, soul less individuals that starts with the top management and continues through middle management. They are the worst. The Junior VPs who have been there for years, so made it early on but they are worse than the Executive VPs because they really have no talent and have no clue how to manage good people. Turnover rate is ridiculous and the actual number of people who make their goal is so incredibly low. The cube culture ensures that your cold calling (which is mostly what it has become) is heard by your boss so he, and the tenured people around you, can berate you for not moving the deal along. And don't even think about working from home--get there at 7am or you are looked at as a loser for not being committed to the cause. Selfish, manic, loud, seductive people do well here for a while or at least until they slip up and end up with the Dakota patch. Or quit because they can not take it anymore. Drunken culture too which is encouraged by the annual Christmas party which costs millions--it's lavish and luxe--and shameful and gluttonous. I had 3 friends quit for the exact same reasons I did and we look back at the experience unfortunately in the nightmares that still occur for the ""month's end"" because we are not closing squat.",31 people found this review helpful

Overall they do a great job hiring intelligent social people who will have fun while still working hard. The product is the best on the market and the technology for the most part blows competition out of the water. For me the best part about working at Salesforce has been the people / co-workers.","Salesforce has an interesting way of recognizing and measuring success, which is mostly driven by tooting your own horn. The practice of ""building you brand"" is more important to your career than doing intelligent and meaningful work. The company is driven by sales and this causes unrealistic expectations on both the sales side as well as product rollout.

While we do pride ourselves on having an open culture, it isn't necessarily a very exciting, friendly or personal culture. You're generally free to do what you like, but many (maybe most) teams don't go to lunch together and aren't friends with each other. They just have small talk and do what it takes to get the job done well. Since your team is who you're with all day and who you talk to most of the time, it's kind of important. I wish it was the other way around, where my team was wanted to talk too much and spend more time hanging out than I did. The employees are kind of old here, so it's just not what I'm used to I suppose. Also, spoiled as I already am here, I will always be jealous of companies that have free cafeterias because I can't cook.",5 people found this review helpful
74,Best Sales Training I have ever had,"Oct 29, 2014 - Account Executive - Small/Medium Business (SMB)",3.0,"The company takes training extremely seriously and within the first 3-6 months you will be given an absolute crash course in Sales Training and modern SaaS selling techniques. Most of the people are fantastic, the benefits are great. If you get the right territory you will make a lot more money than your peers. Things are constantly changing and there are always opportunities to move around in the organization. Salesforce is definitely the best product in the industry for CRM.","The Culture in the Chicago office took a nose dive this year. With fast growth a lot of the wrong people were promoted to leadership positions and have sucked some of the life out of the organization. (On the plus side things move fast so they probably wont be in those roles for too much longer). Their is also a clear political path to success, be liked by the group that is running the show and you will be rewarded with a greater share of the potential sources of commission compared to your peers (There is a loosely defined territory policy which can either be a huge benefit or detriment to your career). The downside is that it appears most of the ""have's"" already have been selected.",2 people found this review helpful

I joined when they had 7000 employees and left 2 years later when they had 12,000. I love their 1::1:1 program which Marc B is completely committed to and uses every chance he gets to promote. The company is well respected and constantly developing or buying new products. If you get the right accounts and manager support you can make a ton of $$$. I personally know a handful of people who made 7 figures.",Your success in sales is highly dependent on your patch(account base) which is hard to predict coming in the front door. The intensity of the company is great but the work/life balance if off as the demands of the job creep into all aspects of your life. Sales quotas go up every year and territories decrease which can be hard to keep up with. The product offering is getting more and more complicated and hard to keep up with. Management changes all the time as I had four managers in a span of 18 months. Their product offering while extensive does not do well in certain verticals so make sure your accounts are in those good verticals. The core CRM product is too complicated and not intuitive as they make it seem.,1 person found this review helpful

With all the growth, it is constantly abuzz with activity and it can be exciting.","People management is very bad... There is massive title inflation. 0-1 year of experience managing people marks most directors, and even many senior directors. There is a serious problem of cronyism in many departments. VPs promote who they want, when they want irrespective of team feedback or even despite what are believed to be established policies. VP-level leadership exhibits schizophrenic decision making, CYA behaviors and abrasive comportment. This makes for highly stressful working environments and is a key cause of the well-known burnout at Salesforce. Many leaders at Salesforce have never done a job this big before which can lend to insecurity and erratic or absent decision making. Reorganizations are painfully frequent which also promotes insecurity & stress.",6 people found this review helpful

You will be given a territory that will ultimately dictate how well you perform. Some AEs are given 2-3 territories while others are given just one. Regardless of your territory, you will have the exact same quota as those with larger ones. Its a numbers game to management. Your manager will want 2-3 of his or her AEs to do really well while everyone else struggles. You will have a monthly quota, your manager will be tasked with grinding you every month for every last dollar possible you can bring in.

148,Best Company I've Ever Worked For,"Jul 25, 2014 - Anonymous in Indianapolis, IN",5.0,"Salesforce ExactTarget is amazing. I can definitely see why we are consistently ranked as one of the Top Places to Work. At the end of the day, it's the people of ExactTarget that have made me find this company to be so special. We have created and maintained this internal culture, which we simply define as ""Orange."" As a result, I have the opportunity to work with some of the most innovative, kind, smart, and hardworking people I've ever met. From leadership down, we all try to follow strong ethical values for our customers, for the community, for ourselves. One of my favorite things is how they always seem to be giving back. I feel like I'm a valued employee because ExactTarget thanks their employees. Not just verbally, once a year at the holiday party cramped into a break room - but with quantifiable actions, benefits, and rewards. • Growth opportunities that include yearly reviews with internal promotions encouraged • Career development courses, tuition reimbursement (up to $5000/year after 1 year at ET), mentorship opportunities, and a dedicated Talent Management team to support you • Networking opportunities (ie ExactWIN - our Women's Inspirational Network, ExactFun - They plan over 40+ social events like going to the Indian's game with the family, drinks and apps at Howl at the Moon, our annual holiday party at Crane Bay etc) • Volunteering opportunities encouraged by the company (6 Volunteering Days off/year, ExactImpact and ExactFoundation - organizations that participates in local service and grant opportunities with organizations like Gleaners, Habitat for Humanity, as well as local schools and hospitals.) • Reasonable time off. PTO: 15 days Holidays: 13 days • Strong benefits package including health, dental, vision, and 401k • Equity for Full Time Hires • Wellness Bucks: $100/month for gym memberships, personal trainers, sports lessons, and/or massages • Free 24/7 Gym membership, Bikeshare membership, onsite classes with options for yoga classes/cross-fit/kickboxing • Cell phone ($150/mo) and internet compensation ($50/mo) at managerial discretion • Flex time and telecommuting options • Lots of free things: free snacks, free good coffee, free drinks, free ""swag- bags, shirts, general stuff"", often free leftover catered lunches in the breakrooms and a free mobile app that tells you what we have, occasionally free sporting events (Colts, Pacers) and musical concerts giveaways • Casual and open work environment","You have to be open to change, which can be hard for some.

The benefits are fantastic, and you'll earn a lot of money if you're smart, motivated, and get things done. One key piece of advice that I have is to be proactive about your career. It can be tempting to code all day long, but you'll need to take a step back every now and then to chart your course over the next several releases to get ahead and stay in control of your career. If you don't, then others may put you into a direction that you might not like. Take charge and make your case to others, and resources will flow to you if others agree with your vision. That actually ties in well with my next point. Every year, each of us must create a ""V2MOM,"" which is Marc Benioff's method of distilling down what you want to do over the next year from both a high level and from a detailed level. You start off with a single vision, list your values, determine the methods that will realize your vision, identify the obstacles that may prevent you from realizing your vision, and create metrics that can measure how you know when you've realized your vision. Many people secretly blow it off and just copy their managers' V2MOMs, but if used properly, it really can make a difference in your own career. As one of the leaders had said, you get from it what you put into it. If you really embrace and use the V2MOM, you'll go far both at work and in life. The culture increasingly uses the V2MOM in its decision making and resource allocations. But don't worry; it's not a cult or anything remotely like that. Salesforce.com invests heavily in its employees. From the high-end office space to comfortable interiors, generous benefits, and firm commitment to meeting and exceeding workplace fairness, policy, and procedure rules and laws, anyone can be free to be themselves at Salesforce.com and do the best work of their lives. I know I am :). I'm an openly gay male, and that has never been held against me (as far as I'm aware, at least).","I hear that politics and such exist at the higher levels, but that's fortunately not visible much at the individual contributor level. If you have a good manager, you don't hear of such things, and you get to just focus on your work and career. So perhaps this is really a 'pro' than a 'con.' Priorities can and do shift regularly. It's really a part of the nature of software development. Top-down changes of directions can and do occur, though most have been huge successes. If you want a place where you go off into a corner and code on one thing for months or years, then Salesforce.com is not the place for you. Everything is collaborative, and you must be able to work well in a team. If you don't, then you'll hopefully learn quickly :-). Work-life balance can be difficult to achieve if you are eager to help everyone who comes your way with questions. It's really a matter of self-discipline to achieve a work-life balance, and it's almost all within your control.",7 people found this review helpful

228,"IT ""Leadership""","Apr 19, 2014 - Manager in San Francisco, CA",1.0,"Most people in IT, Finance and other support departments seem to be here to get the salesforce name on their resume. That is definitely a plus. Pay seems good, but maybe not when considering the hours. Enormous turnover leads to lots of opportunities for advancement if you can outshine flashy external hires from consulting backgrounds.","Inflated titles and absent support staff leads to many ""managers"" and ""directors"" who are purely individual contributers. All managers and directors have individual contributor duties. For people managers, headcount are constantly changing--just because you have a team of 6 this year doesn't prevent half of them from being taken away next year. Management structures change multiple times per year, and even change above the CIO. The internal systems are falling apart and leaders all the way up are much more focused on politics and image. They completely neglect anything objectively meaningful or helpful. The environment has gotten so toxic in the last couple years that leaders semi-openly talk about trying to get out of here. The CIO doesn't lead the organization at all, and everyone goes to either the ""chief of staff"" or the head of the PMO instead. The chief of staff is not qualified / competent to run a single department, let alone being a de facto head of IT. IT is forced to pay for all related costs out of the IT G&A budget with no charge-backs. This inflates our budget and hides that we're actually significantly underfunded, especially considering the technical debt. (we've almost figured out wifi in the last year, but we still need wired hubs in the conference rooms) Much worse than the state of IT is the state of Finance. Every month we're asked to change behavior because something in accounting /finance changed, or something was miscoded or reclassified and no one knew until after the books closed. People and processes change so often that there is no chance of hitting your budget honestly, or even understanding where it came from. We are told that it's worse to be under budget than overbought, because if we're under in any quarter, we potentially lose that budget going forward. You can imagine the consequences of that policy. The financial systems are a joke. We don't know how to support finance and consequently, they can't support us. What we report is massaged by accounting manually in Excel to a degree that we cannot effectively speak to our own numbers. As a result everyone involved is frustrated, failing, and looking for an out. No one in leadership is willing to acknowledge the fundamental problems as the culture requires us to be ever-positve in public and to ""just make it work"", then report success. I believe this is because (1) CEO is a salesman first, leader second, and doesn't want to hear it, and (2) because everyone up the chain would rather claim success and move to a different company, than stay and actually try to fix anything.",14 people found this review helpful

Let's be honest, Midwest people are just some of nicest people around. If you live in Indy there are a lot of great opportunities The sincerity of leadership and the people quickly make you happy to go to work, I actually consider 90% of the people I worked with friends. If you manage your time and have a general interest in the technology there are tons of things to do. I've dabbled in product sessions, support workshop hours, custom app dev, etc. All while doing my day job. Because Indy is small most of the talented people in the area end up at ET. A lot of talent resides in the town, and the C level team strives to keep the company local.","Only Product jobs are in Indy. Comp is only great if you live in the Midwest, if you're hired to work in a remote office be prepared to work with clients of similar skills sets that will make a lot more than you. Benefits are not equal per locale, some offices get parking, food, gyms, subway passes, etc. Simply because that's the bare min to acquire people in that locale, too bad for you if you don't live there. PTO is really poor compared to our parent company SalesForce Benefits are not up to par with our parent company SalesForce, try to find ET benefits and then find SF benefits. You'll notice ET's benefits are impossible to find and SF brags about theirs. That should be your sign. If you're assigned to SOW in Services or Support, there is little to no incentive to move you into something challenging. Most changes are done because of attrition as the organization are pretty flat outside of product. Salary bands don't exist, or if they do they are very lax. It's common someone on your team negotiated really hard and someone just took a college entry job. HR still doesn't have a classification for all skill sets in the field.
