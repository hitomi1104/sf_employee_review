0,Amazing company,,5.0,"I have been with Salesforce for 6 years and am so impressed with the direction and way the company has been growing. The sense of belonging is really here as the leadership really makes sure each employee is taken care of. With the recent climate of Covid-19, I truly saw how much Salesforce valued each employee and prioritized each and every one of our health. The company has grown 4x the size since I started and it's a great feeling to contribute to the growth. The benefits here are amazing as well. My favorites are the wellness reimbursement program, ESPP and 401k.","Technology performance issues within Recruiting could be better but the team works hard to improve and it shows,",2 people found this review helpful

2,Great experience so far!,,4.0,"Great work-life balance and benefits Great colleagues and team spirit Remote position Networking opportunities Customers engagements are interesting and challenging Great training and enrichment opportunities Great job for those who like to work 1:1 with customers Lots of giving back, VTO, and charity opportunities Focus on equality and equity in the workplace, which is one of my #1 reasons for being here! Having been at other companies where you are worked to burnout and then some. I also know that some roles here are taxing and overwhelming as well. I have not experienced that in this role. This is an advisory and support role. You will be relied upon to know the platform, know security schemas, and some architecture and help, guide, and teach customers best practices. There are a lot of reading, learning, and conversations. Presentation, communication, demonstration, and soft skills are also needed for this role.","Sometimes you feel like you are on your own, and have to figure things out. Not a lot of 1:1 development, you have to feel out what you want from your manager Not always sure I am ""on the right track"" The pace of change is fast, especially with acquisitions It's not a great job for anyone who needs constant reassurance, you will do best if you are a go-getter and can network on your own with your teams. Hours can be long depending on the time of year for customers",Be the first to find this review helpful

14,A Company that Takes Care of its People,,5.0,"In general, the company has great values. It's one that takes care of its people, and gives back to the community. Benefits are generous, including 5 volunteer days included in PTO. When the pandemic hit, Salesforce made sure that its employees were well-outfitted to work from home, and emphasized prioritizing mental health and balancing new work/life struggles. (Note that it wasn't all rosy, Salesforce also chose to do a round of layoffs during the pandemic, even though they were experiencing a record quarter, which caused a lot of controversy.) For as large of a company as Salesforce is, it is reasonably transparent. Employees have access to executive leadership, and have opportunities to ask them tough questions, such as regarding the layoffs they chose to do during the pandemic.","There is a lot of pride in Salesforce's culture, which can often feel a bit cult-like. I joined Salesforce through an acquisition, and the leaders at the acquired company seemed much more used to tough questions than leaders that I observed at Salesforce. There's also a lot of internal training stuff through their internal trailhead platform that seems more time-consuming and less value-packed compared to other companies I've worked at.",1 person found this review helpful

47,"A good career move, but the politics can be brutal",,3.0,"I worked at Salesforce for almost 10 years, over a lot of growth. There was a lot of opportunity to do different things. There are some great people at the organization that I worked with, and for a while felt well compensated for my contributions. Having Salesforce on your resume is a great career builder.","As the company has gotten bigger, roles have become more narrow. I had looked to move into another role for a while, but, as a director level, there weren't a lot of opportunities - Salesforce is hiring more and more junior people to fill roles. My position was eliminated and replaced by an analyst level person straight out of college. Many other higher level ( read- older, long-term employees) folks were part of the same layoff in 2020. You will have many different managers while you are there - I had 13 in 8 1/2 years. So, if you have a bad one, wait - they will move into something else. The bad part of this is its hard to make a mark when you constantly have to re-prove yourself. The company used to give raises every year - even just a cost of living raise. This stopped around 2017 or so. So negotiate your upfront salary well.",12 people found this review helpful

The opportunity to work on different tech stacks is great. The people in Security Assurance are highly dedicated and live the value of Trust.

Without a clear vision and direction, the focus is on fire fighting and operational day-to-day tasks. The culture never recovered from the DefCon/Meat Pistol incident and leadership turnover.

85,It's a mirage - Do you research,,2.0,Similar to other reviews pros. You can find their benefits packages online. The company acquires new business almost semi-annually so you can potentially move around. Benefits/Perks/ESPP Some amazing coworkers Pretty good c-suite/ Amazing middle line managers Great managing Covid - Listened to the employee feedback for the most part,"There are reviews here with 0 cons which I find hard to believe for a 60K employee company. They jam public surveys down our throats to get the image of the ""Best place to work."" Seems like HR is rushing to drown out poor reviews.... Salesforce is an okay place with some very, very toxic people. I've met one of the worst human beings of my life here, and with how the world is in 2021, that's saying a lot. First-line leaders are more often bad than good. Back office draws territories randomly every year, and leaders have very little say, so it's the luck of the draw. Under 20% of reps hit quota and meet their OTE for a company already underpaying due to their name. You need to hit quota to get paid a reasonable amount which only happens once maybe twice a year if you're lucky. Managers won't acknowledge that you have a bad territory and have the same expectations as the leading rep. Leading rep makes 3 to 4 times the amount of everyone else and is put on a pedestal but everyone including themselves knows it's the opportunity given. Accounts change every year, so prospecting is demotivating, knowing the work you do will go to someone else. Essentially an order taker with not enough orders to hit quota. Very saturated market. Inundated with pointless nonrevenue generating admin work/meetings. Inundated is an understatement. The majority of the information logged within the CRM is fake due to the pressure to meet all of the initiatives and stay off the naughty list. Leading to inaccurate reporting which leads to increased expectations. You will be drowning, gasping for air as your first-line leaders stand on your shoulders with their heads out of the water... for the most part. If you can tread water for 2+ years, you will get the Salesforce stamp of approval on your resume to find a better, higher-paying job. 2-3 year turnover is drastic. HARD WORK DOES NOT GET YOU AHEAD. Your mental health and wellbeing will deteriorate. Please do your research and reach out to folks working there to get their opinions.",13 people found this review helpful

Being a female over 40 is dangerous unless you are deemed traditionally attractive and in a submissive role. Despite all the lip service to “equality” the idea of it within the workplace culture is selective an applies only to those who cow and obey the party line. 2. Salesforce puts the CULT in CULTure. There’s an underlying expectation that Salesforce should fulfill every part of your being.

Would love to stay forever.,,4.0,- Great culture - Work-life balance - Great managers - Everyone is open to having a coffee/ networking chat,- Not many entry level job openings - No clear definitions for what qualifies people for the leveling of jobs - Not enough opportunities for entry level-people to transition into associate/ specialist level roles within some organizations,1 person found this review helpful

211,"Great for first timers, Not so great for seasoned folks","Jul 21, 2021 - Senior Account Executive",2.0,"Solid products, truly #1 CRM in the market, at least for customers that know how to properly implement and use the tech for success. Tons of enablement and assets to leverage in selling, however a lot of the materials live in disparate locations making it tough to navigate. You work with a huge extended Salesforce army, many of which are specialists on a specific product so you’re not expected to be an expert on all solutions which is nearly impossible considering the amount of products you have to sell. You will learn so much here about the art of selling, they truly do produce some of the best sales talent. ESPP is nice, but so is equity which as a sales person you don’t get because they think your commission is enough but the reality is if you’re not meeting your monthly goals then you’re not reaping any of that “benefit”. Monthly wellness stipend is nice and so is the name recognition you'd get on a resume.","1) When starting out they will give you the worst patch to see if you can turn dry lemons into lemonade. As you get more tenured you may or may not receive a better patch, it depends on how you want to navigate the favoritism game. The more popular you are with leadership, the better the accounts and the more flips you will get. 2) To be successful it's all about the 3 T's: Territory, Timing, and Talent in exactly that order. If your accounts aren't growing, you will have a very difficult year ahead living on base salary alone which is already way lower than market. Be prepared to spin your wheels which can often feel like high effort low return as CRM decisions don't happen overnight. 3) Every start of the fiscal accounts are shifted around which can be frustrating both internally and externally. The revolving door of AEs makes it hard to establish long term trust with customers. 4) Be prepared to invest a lot of time fixing CSAT issues from poor implementation left behind from the rep before you. 5) The majority of ACV is made in Q4 which is around year-end holidays, making it stressful to take time off.",2 people found this review helpful

223,Great company but growing chaos,"Oct 9, 2020 - Senior Director - Sales in San Francisco, CA",4.0,- Great benefits - Most impressive execution of core values I have seen at any company - Work life balance is great (definitely depends on your role/org) - Love Salesforce relevant solutions that impact on our customers' business. It's not all marketing! It's exciting to see the partnership between Salesforce and our top customers.,- Increasing growth of middle management and more executive leaders without clear roles/responsibilities. - Many teams do the same thing under different names. It's confusing how many teams you need to work with to get something simple accomplished. - Inconsistent leadership - some leaders focus more time on managing-up versus ensuring their people are successful. I've had amazing leaders and mentors but also horrible leaders who marginalize their people. - No clear path for IC career growth. Salesforce gets very political with people garnering for expanded responsibility and headcount - not focused on performance.,5 people found this review helpful

I came in as an outside hire for the first 4 months in the role my Account Executives had no time for me to learn about their accounts, what their goals were and wouldn't let me into their key accounts to help set meetings. This affects my KPI's and was expected to perform with little to no direction. It's radio silent in my 1:1s and was asked to come up with points of view into their new logo accounts. They don't utilize their BDRs correctly and believe were supposed to research all of their new logo accounts and come in with a step by step plan. How am I supposed to do this with no knowledge or direction on any of the products or goals? I've been told by other reps that you have to internally sell you AE's on why things should be opportunities. It's very gamey and if you don't know how to play it...you're in for a rough ride.",7 people found this review helpful
261,"Started out amazing, unfortunately went downhill",,2.0,The startup culture that still somewhat exists here. Work from home is great if they'll let support be a part of that. Pay and benefits are great. You feel safe to work here in terms of equality. Salesforce really does shine in this realm.,"The push for productivity on top of enormous amount of learning material pushed on people here is unrealistic and stress inducing. During the pandemic more work was given than less. Getting a promotion requires you to push numbers rather than do work that benefits the team. All of the number fibbers and cherry pickers are the ones getting the back rubs here. Work/life balance is not respected all that much. It's stated that you should strive for a work/life balance, but the amount of work given does not allow it, and you'll usually find yourself frantically looking for extra time to fulfill work that's been unrealistically dumped on you. KPIs are unrealistic given the extension of some issues that customers raise. Upper management makes quick uneducated changes that usually goes against what everyone in the org would recommend, but they do it anyways.",7 people found this review helpful
