17,"Great Company, Day to Day just ok",,3.0,"- Salesforce has a great product and growing suite of products to sell. Most customers and new leads are happy to speak to Salesforce. - Great earning potential, obviously if you are doing well, but even if you aren't, product spiffs and bonuses can help towards making your OTE. - Benefits cover almost everything you can think of. Highest education reimbursement I've seen in tech companies. Base pay in esmb could be improved, but it depends where you are in life if you value the cash or benefits more. - Room for promotion (it can be slow, but no slower than most big tech companies). - A no brainer move if you aren't already in the tech industry- one of few tech companies that seems to be open to hiring non tech sales backgrounds. A lot of the cons below happen everywhere so you may as well benefit from Salesforce's great benefits and commission. - Their selling methodology isn't for the faint hearted, but you genuinely will learn a lot about selling.","- There are 4 layers of management between you and the person who manages SMB . All these layers are forecasting to each other and it just seems to fuel the micromanagement activity and meetings for the sake of meetings culture. - Managers only care about their team number and really don't care about how you are doing individually. Leads to micromanagement when the team isn't doing well. If you are doing well, there's no real incentive for you to do better for the sake of the team, it's just what your manager wants. - Territories and verticals are very uneven. Best territories given to more tenured AEs which happens in a lot of companies, but makes your first year difficult to succeed without some luck. - Really not much culture day to day. There are team dinners and days out but not much is done to create a sense of fun in the job itself. This was the same even in the office. - No recognition outside of $ closed. - Apart from one or two, the product specialists only seem to want to help when your deal is about to close.",6 people found this review helpful

45,Demo Engineering India is Career Killer,,1.0,"- All Pros are Company level. - Competitive benefits. - Brand recognition - Exposure to the sales org, if you have aspirations to enter sales.","Applicable only to India team and for the time period this review is written for, - Non technical, director with no salesforce certification and poor knowledge of salesforce products and business. - The above makes this individual a poor leader for a technical team. Under this leadership, the India team has a sluggish growth to their careers. - Unrealistic targets and workloads are set for the team which led to long working hours and high pressure high stress work environment. - Work done here is boring, low impact and repetitive. There was no career defining work in this team for the time this review was written. - Management is a bully, openly threatening and humiliating team mates. Several incidents of this have occurred. But employees are too frightened of retaliation to bring out the issue. - Top down policies and decisions. Team mates have no voice and have to follow all decision leadership makes. - High stress environment created by an autocratic leadership. - Team is expected to work long hours and weekends. - Team are heavily monitored and micromanaged. Egs if you do not clock in by 9 am you will be called out in an email, in a public meeting and reported to HR. - Management is indifferent to creating career growth paths for its team members who do not want to become Solution Engineers. - Limited slow promotions, terrible hikes and highly gated pathways for internal transfer. Management claims that Demo Engineers are highly regarded in the company, yet demo engineers are not top choice for internal transfers, in India. - The leadership of India team creates unofficial policies that are against the overall organisation policies. Examples are non-reimbursement of failed attempts at certification. Use of whatsapp as an official communication channel, tho it is explicitly banned by salesforce. - Skip levels are highly discouraged. These are a threat to India management, in case of whistleblowers.",4 people found this review helpful

Their management is very immature and will have expectations from you like working over weekend, working late nights, completing dev works of 3 weeks in 3 days.

However they were very complimentary on my performance and said that they would like to consider me for another role when one was available. I did not think I would get a call back. However, within a couple of weeks I did, and they sped up the normal recruitment process for me in order to get me on board.

You’d expect a company like Salesforce to have a smooth process. But here’s the real story- My onboarding and interview was an absolute nightmare. This was my dream company, so obviously when I received an offer from them, I accepted it, even if it meant taking a huge pay cut. These guys would leverage Salesforce US culture into talking you down for salaries but would say shamelessly that Salesforce has a transparent pay scale. When I entered the company, I found out that I was the least paid employee in the team. Anyhoo, I accepted the offer and it was their turn to send laptop and other peripherals. Well they didn’t, their procurement team never replied, not on slack, not on calls, not anywhere and I had to bring senior management into this. Well after 15 days of joining, I had received the laptop but mind you even though you don’t have your company phone or company laptop, they’ll start evaluating your performance from day 1, because dude you are in Business Development. So you gotta be an Einstien and a God maybe to do 500 billion things at one time and managers even then would find a way to complain. They expect us to work for 10 hours every day, attend useless meetings, and work like a machine without taking a breath. And they’ll preach about the helping culture of Salesforce, lol. The AEs don’t respond on time, hell even the managers themselves don’t respond until you ping them again and again. And they want us to feel gratitude for the company bevause it pays salary. They have 0 empathy for their employees, they turn deaf ear to our problems. I am suffocating here but I can’t teach out to anyone because guess what everyone is the same. This is a typical employee exploiting company which has created a bubble of a good work culture. PS- this is just for India.

110,They love me - and I love them...,"May 27, 2021 - Enterprise Account Executive in Toronto, ON",5.0,"They focus on work-life balance. Managers are always encouraging days off (19 Days off in your first year). It's fast paced, you make what you deserve based on how much you work, but the training and development is INTENSE. You are empowered over and over again to be successful - so if you aren't hitting or exceeding your number, it's not because of the patch, or the situation - it's because you aren't taking enough advantage of the enablement.","Sales is sales and with a resetting quota at the end of every month, you have to be prepared to reset at $0 and do it all over again. Even though we get 19 Days off in the first year, it's hard to take time off because the less you work, the less you make. Company is growing from a startup to a major corporation - that growth means there are a lot of things that are changing and you hear about the ""good old days"" a lot - as if you missed out on how things used to be (not pre pandemic, I mean like 10 years ago) and things have changed a lot.",4 people found this review helpful

Often new managers are poor and take a couple of team cycles to learn the role and until then tend to be dashboard refreshers and somewhat micro manage. This leads to stagnation of people's career and development plans due to the lack of communication, poor expectation setting and focusing solely on the sales target.

Left after two years, I feel like the whole environment became much more hostile towards employees. At the beginning there was more learning space, career advancement expectations and good management, but I think the company lost track of the value of the employees lately and they are experiencing high attrition rates as a consequence. No space to express opinions and suggest improvements, some markets are restructured and there is no easiness of communication. Most of the colleagues who started with me left for better opportunities in terms of salary and benefit. HR is very slow at replying and they closed the main Public (internal) channel of communication- I guess because there were too many complaints to take care of. Management is often disorganized and issues are solved slowly if ever, resulting in frustration for the employees and possibly financial and work balance consequences. Satisfaction surveys are often handled out but results are not taken into account- or at least that’s what seems like. Some teams were asked to disclose if they undertake interviews with other companies. No clear vision to go back to office and giving reassurance to teams.",4 people found this review helpful

Prospecting is very difficult as you sometimes only have 3-10 accounts to work with in total, but the target seems to be created from a growth mindset where every account is going through a full digital transformation. Base salaries are relatively low (compared with similar organisations), so if you're not blessed with a great patch, you are going through tough times.

So many tiers of management, so many VPs and SVPs trying to justify whey they're there, it just gets exhausting. You can't quite see the termites, but the underlying rot has set in and been reinforced by all of the Oracle and Microsoft intake. The 'leaders' love talking about 'who they are as a leader (without seeming to understand you're only a leader if someone wants to follow you through choice, not reporting line). Talk of values is kind of funny - everyone loves to tell you what their values are, but ask them what that looks like when they're 'living their values' and they all pretty much draw a blank...",11 people found this review helpful
