We chatted on Google Meet the next day, and she then scheduled for me to meet with 5 managers. The interview was fantastic - it was a smooth and fun conversation where they got to learn about me, and I got to learn about Salesforce, the role I applied for, and a little about them as well. You can tell they really care about giving everyone a fair chance. I'm incredibly thankful to Salesforce and this team for giving me their time.

You have to be BDR, AE and even SE on some opportunities, unless you're in the enterprise/strategic accounts.
