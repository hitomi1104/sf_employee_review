1,Awesome,"Mar 6, 2012 - Lead Member of Technical Staff in San Francisco, CA",5.0,"Great company to work for. Great people, fun environment, rock culture. Lot of opportunities to grow. Have great internal policies and performance evaluation cycle. Promotion evaluation happens every quarter rather than 1 year for all typical companies. RSUs vest every quarter after first year. Bonus structure is good and is paid every 6 months.",Young people in the management are inexperienced and proud as it was a small company and suddenly gained a lot of fame and they rose to a higher management position. They sometimes don't know how to give positive feedback but do a superb job in providing negative feedback.,Be the first to find this review helpful

Developers are very talented and hardworking. - Compensation is one of the best in the industry. Other benefits include free breakfast, snacks, fruits, frequent team lunches - You have the flexibility to shift to any team after few releases and there is absolutely no politics in that proces. You can chose to work in back-end server side work or front-end or mobile or any technology you want. - If you are good people really respect you and you have a lot of potential to grow. There is very less politics here compared to the other big companies I have seen",- Sometimes the work can become very hectic and you might have to put extra hours to get things done.,1 person found this review helpful

8,This is one of the best companies in the world.,"Jan 30, 2012 - Sales Representative in Spokane Valley, Optional[WA]",5.0,"Salesforce is a very forward-thinking and progressive company. Pay is generous, and the company goes out of its way after you are hired to make you feel important. Orientation takes in place in San Francisco, and they'll fly you down there. Part of orientation involves volunteer work at a local charitable organization; in fact the company gives you an additional paid week off each year to devote toward volunteer work. Benefits are excellent, and include fitness expense reimbursement ($100/mo) in addition to full medical, health and dental. My division buys the entire office catered lunch twice a week, although that perk doesn't apply everywhere. Managers are fair, and don't ask their employees to work to exhaustion. The company is growing at a rapid pace, so there is plenty of room for growth and advancement. Finally, there is the name recognition that comes with working at a prestigious company. Salesforce. People in the IT world place it in the same category as Google and Apple. Even if you don't stick around long-term, it looks great on a resume.","Interoffice scuttlebutt is of course an issue, but it's not a problem unique to Salesforce by any means. In the division I am a part of, there is no formalized training or onboarding program, so the first couple weeks can be rough while you get acclimated. With all the growth, sales territories are constantly being moved around and this can make rapport building with clients difficult.",Be the first to find this review helpful

People are respectful, fair, honest. Jerks are just not allowed. It's like a very healthy body -- if a bad seed sneaks in, a bunch of healthy cells surround it and gently show it how to behave. Pay is great, product is taking off, Benioff leads by example -- he started this company and he's still here. He's passionate about what we do, and gives credit to his team(s) for making his vision(s) come to fruition. Couldn't be happier.","None really.

Coming from a big4 consulting background I was excited when I first joined. Only to find a hige divide between the techies(Platform) and the traditional(CRM) types. Internally they are afraid of each other and it is somewhat cannibalistic. Techies will find the CRM types are outdated, don't hava a clue and find it hard to adapt to the pure cloud vision. This place is good to get on your resume. Learn there technologies and hit the independent road if you want to make some real money in this over-hyped cloud/Saas market. Management is clueless and career development by a mentor is a joke as many legacy people are from the CRM space just trying not to get fired so they can hold on to their stock options. Their best employees go independent to tap the market while it is still hot. The spineless remain. Oh, did I mention the politics?",9 people found this review helpful

They have great benefits and they are willing to offer you commute benefits to cut down your commute costs. I think this company treats their employees really well. QA are especially very well respected within the R&D unlike other software companies where QA doesn't have much of a say in big decisions.

I can't count the # of AEs who fled this place in the 2009 timeframe - dozens. If you are crazy enough to take a job here, be sure you get the exact territory you will be covering written down as part of accepting the job offer - the bait and switch to lure people in here is well-known. You will be promised Chicago and leave your current job, get in the door, take your seat, and be given Louisiana (the boss' girlfriend will end up getting Chicago and no one will remember that you got told you were getting the Windy City - plus the boss' BF probably works in HR so no one to turn to in order to complain). Further, read ALL of the other reviews and comments here on Glassdoor.com - specifically the comments. Again there is a reason this company is giving out 10k referal bonuses to all employees who refer a salesperson who gets hired - and the employee(s) there will tell you how wonderful it is - they're desperate for new people to take the crap jobs so the AEs currently there get the good ones .... and the AEs want the 10k bonus for submitting your resume. They're so greedy for it - its all over LinkedIn constantly. PS - Don't believe the Forbes average salary hype either - that salary figure includes a tiny percentage of Sr. AEs who make $1M plus per year. Countless AEs didnt make jack above their base salary last year - ask about this. And if you get pushed out .... DO NOT LET THEM TALK YOU INTO SIGNING THEIR LEGAL WAIVERS TO PROTECT THEMSELVES",26 people found this review helpful

147,Think twice,,1.0,The benefits package is excellent. You gain a lot of experience in a short period of time. You gain excellent product knowledge I took the job because I thought it would be a great place to learn.,"The politics in play prevent you from doing your job. You are not recognized for performance, and there are limited opportunities for growth. Salesforce overworks and underpays employees in key roles while rewarding employees in roles that are less critical. You are subjected to trial by fire with little or no management support.",7 people found this review helpful

HEAVY HEAVY Politics which could be a good thing if you come from that already. Oh and good christmas party”,"1. Any signed contract whether in sales, technology or consulting is most likely bait and switch. Consulting : Promised 90 days ramp up. Given: 30 due to needs. Result: Project failure, bullying by staff over lack of knowledge. Denial: ""We give our staff plenty of training to succeed in their jobs"". Result: Customers not satisfied with deliverables because new consultants can not succeed with training; attrition. Technology: Big red letters on ramp up page. ""If you want to take a day off to take care of your kid, thats called PTO"". So beware those sorry people who have children. Expect 9pm exits from work most days. Sales: Promised territories, good prospects, etc. Reality used car sales. Micro deals that burns you out. They rotate you to a new territory every 6 months so you never get comfortable. Poor client relations skills because Sales Manager or SE manager is always in room watching you. Ive seen better treatment at my Chevy dealer of the reps who atleast are comfortable in their pants. SRs who even show an emotion or personality are singled out from the mindless phone dialers who cold call prospects. No vacation.

There are lots of exciting things to work on here. Salesforce is also committed to philanthropy and not only encourages, but helps facilitate the donation of up to 1% of each of its employee's time to the causes they care about.","The company is committed to regularly delivering products that are of high quality and delivered on time.

It's no joke. The product at Salesforce is really good -- sometimes it sells itself -- and it's very well thought through and architected. I've worked at a number of other software companies and I've never seen anything like it. Career advancement opportunities are everywhere. Although it's a fairly big company now, it's definitely possible to identify opportunities and take them, even from the very bottom rung of the latter, and management actively encourages it. The executives are also top-notch and generally very accessible. These are the people I want to learn from. They know what they're doing.","The hours are definitely long, no doubt about that. There are never enough people on board to do all the work necessary. There's always a certain amount of chaos. Salesforce definitely exhibits some qualities usually reserved for startups in that regard -- every day is challenging, but it sure makes going to work fun.",Be the first to find this review helpful

Senior Management needs to stop worshiping itself and actually run the company and stop being a yes man to Marc B. If he farts, they say, oh Marc, it smells like Teen Spirit. No, honestly, that idea doesn't stink at all. Marketing is a sink hole of money at salesforce. They've pretty much promoted the CMO from within, when others wouldn't come aboard to run the department. While I was there, all they managed to hire was a slew of VP's and Directors into marketing. So for marketing, I would say it's very, very top heavy, with no one to do the actual work. They have this thing called a V2MOM that should be eliminated.

The frequency that salesforce changes their reps and alignment doesn't tend to sit well with most customers. This has created a struggle to expand, particularly in the enterprise space. Poor alignment between cloud teams for GTM. Most ""generalists"" or ""Account Directors"" are compensated for the efforts of specialists although they don't pull their weight. Many recent reps are fairly green and do not possess the maturity to run a proper sales cycle. Some specialists are running rogue/lone-wolf engagements which can torpedo deals/relationships.
