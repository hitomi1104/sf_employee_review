3,One of the best teams to work in Salesforce - Demo Engineering,,5.0,"Salesforce is an awesome place to work. I was fortunate enough to work with few teams in Salesforce during my tenure. Demo Engineering was one of them so when I heard about some rumblings about this team, I thought of sharing my perspective. DE is one of the most amazing teams in Salesforce to work. It houses some of the best talents from the Industry with diverse cultural background. If you bring two things to the table talent and right attitude then irrespective of your gender, age or experience you get the spot on this team. I’ve seen leadership bring in lot of fresh talent with almost no experience but with right attitude. Also there have been cases when folks with not-so-great english were also given opportunity solely based on their talent. How to use technology to bring transparency in an organization is something one should learn from Salesforce. From number of demos you worked on, number of hrs you logged or even number of times your received appreciation, everything is open and accessible at each level from your peers to top global leadership. DE Team is entrusted with task of delivering successful demos where you are racing against time. There is lot of support and encouragement not just from leadership but even from within the team. During my initial days, team helped me learn and get up to speed with work. Whenever I was stuck with anything, team was just a call away. I’ve never worked in a team with such strong sense of ownership till now. During my tenure, India team was leader among global teams in delivering most number of successful demos. There is lot of focus from on your professional and personal growth. I’ve seen people getting nominated for various technical and leadership trainings. Also, Salesforce was kind enough to identify and sponsor trainings for folks who face challenge in communication. You are encouraged to create your own development plan keeping your talent and aspirations in mind. Leadership helps create various growth opportunities for each team member. There is guidance and coaching available for each member. I've seen successful transitions from this team into various roles within Salesforce and even outside. In their pursuit of giving back to society, Salesforce encourages each employee to volunteer. They not only provide paid time off for such volunteering activities but also give hefty sum of $2000 as a grant which each employee can donate. Volunteering activities are available throughout the year and employees are free to choose them as per their interests and beliefs. DE is one of the few teams in Salesforce where each team member proudly achieves their volunteering goals every year. Salesforce provides flexibility of work hours and work from home. Each team defines their own schedule and work hours keeping healthy overlap between their global peers. DE work hours in India are 9-5. At times you are required to get on a call with global peers late evening or early mornings but the folks are always considerate of the fact.",Nothing I could think of.,3 people found this review helpful

5,Fantastic organisation to be part of. #dreamjob #ohana,,5.0,"1:1:1 model - employees are encouraged to take time to give back, even being given 6 days per year to take for this. Competitive salary #ohana culture - you really feel like part of something, and the organisation truly cares about its staff Innovation - it's easy to feel proud to work for a company who is the pioneer for what they do. Career development - you can have an entire career within the organisation, lots of roles and flexibility to move around.",Rapid growth means constant change - some may struggle with this. Internal systems struggle somewhat to keep up with the growth and constant innovation - we should be drinking our own champagne. The larger we grow the more careful we have to be about preserving our unique culture - this needs to be managed top down and newly hired leaders need to be on board.,Be the first to find this review helpful
6,Advice - Don't fall in the trap of Infra org positions!!,,1.0,- Great visionary CEO - Good compensation/Stocks - Food and snacks - 1:1:1 volunteering model and lot more...,"- Lack of Transparency in every thing, whether it is promotion, interviews, work etc. Promo - Collect feedback from your favourite people and get promoted to VP even if your sub ordinates or people working under you don't like your style of functioning. Just like typical Indian govt. office promo's where you throw money here you throw feedbacks. Interviews - Whom to hire for the position, what qualities to look for, what job responsibilities should be conveyed, no clarity. Hire and attract talent by throwing industry buzzwords like etc. containers, docker, kubernetes, etc and tell them to work on round the clock patching or deployment work. (No forum to raise this concern apart from glassdoor) - No clear vision from senior/mid senior management/infra leadership. People at bottom most level who don't know what they are supposed to be delivering in infra. Software engineers working on operations work to resolve switch issues and fixing racks, working with DC engineers. They don't have any clarity or vision of future from leadership. (No forum to raise this concern apart from glassdoor) - How to get all star award? Well there are lot of ways to achieve it: 1) Sit in US HQ office and screw things in production time and time again and get a all star award. If you do the same from Hyderabad then you will land into PIP (Performance improvement program). 2) Create a half baked software or an automation working in silo without taking any requirements from actual endusers. Create a hype around it, push it to prod with no proper testing, provide zero documentation, get stocks/promo's/all stars and then move out of the project to screw something else. - No alignment Work for some other team and report to someone else in the management chain who has no idea what are you doing. V2MoM of folks in hyderabad is more of marketing gimmick it fails to provide any alignment, clarity or vision for people working at the ground level. When you are asked to talk about it no ones know how to get it sorted, they just want to keep doing things the way they are because end of the day they are more concerned about there own promo's. (No forum to raise this concern apart from glassdoor)",24 people found this review helpful

31,A great place to work but,"Jun 15, 2018 - Anonymous Employee in Hyderābād",4.0,"1. VTO - Voluntary Time Out - I was skeptical about this before joining, but I am so happy and proud that Salesforce encourages and facilitates voluntary activity among employees. The act of giving back is indeed there. 2. Smart people, It feels great to be surrounded by people who are smarter than you. 3. Very flexible working style and support work-life balance. 4. Competitive pay with amazing benefits and perks. My favorites are wellness and education reimbursement. 5. Work quality is good, got to work on some really cool products. 6. They encourage you to control your own career in fact you can transfer to other teams for an opportunity if you fit the bill. 7. The V2MOM process is their USP, I was surprised to see the leadership is living and breathing it and use it to bring alignment across teams. 8. They encourage employee well being, provide food, liberal leave policy includes paternal leave policy.","1. Poor onboarding of new employees. Esp. if you are part of a team that doesn't have a presence in Hyderabad or your Boss sits in a different office. 2. The recruitment team is not friendly/professional during the hiring process. The hiring process took almost 10 weeks and I had to call at least 10 - 15 times to remind them to release the offer (even the hiring manager confirmed I have been hired) 3. Information overflow (very poor signal to noise ratio). Sometimes you will be amazed at so many emails/chatter flying around you and you don't know what to do abou it. 4. The Employee Success Team (HR) needs to pull their socks up. As a new employee, I had faced several problems in the early days. I asked for help, but they were never there. It felt they just don't care.",2 people found this review helpful

Horrible management and lack of leadership and responsibility 2. Salesforce Hyd R&D does not hold the title well since most of the work is service based. 3. The R&D management does not offer growth, leaders of this group are very impatient and rude. Not worth being in good books. No respect given to peer’s and sub-ordinates, R&D management is only concerned about its own position and growth. 4. The management in Hyd office will claim that Salesforce among the best companies to work for - this is true but only applies to the US head office, certainly does not apply to Hyd office. 5. Don't be surprised that young employees working in this company for quiet some time can be political and very influential. 6. The maturity in most employees is below par. They have only one thought in mind, how to grow and get more money no matter if they have to step over there own colleague. 7. Work life balance is bad in some teams. Expectation is you will have to slog and meet the deadlines. If you don't then you need to look elsewhere. 8. Salesforce Hyd has always been on the HQ's radar in terms of quality of work and deliveries. Unfortunately the situation is not good. 9. Quality of work is ridiculously below par. People don't care if the code is messed up, all that is important is releasing the product with the proposed feature. 10. In some teams, employees argue and embarrass each other with respect to deliveries. They don’t care about one’s self respect, no respect for other colleague, finger pointing is a very common phenomenon. 11. Feedback sickness - management will constantly take feedback from diff employees working in your team, if anyone gives wrong feedback; that will not be communicated back to you, instead it will be used against u. 12.

I feel privileged to work not only for a high-paced, innovative company who has been a pioneer in it's field since 1999, but one that also has strong values and does it's part to make the world a better place. At an individual level, we are encouraged to volunteer in our community (we get 56 hours of volunteer time off per year) but on a company-wide level, our leaders have taken stands to improve the state of the world.

Also, the philanthropy element which is baked into the culture is phenomenal. The culture is extremely strong, positive, and just a little bit different than the big corporate tech firms. It's not for everyone, but for those who are nice people and like intensity but fun, it's great!","If you don't maintain boundaries, it would be easy to drown under the workload.

297,Just Awful,"Apr 9, 2016 - Anonymous Employee",1.0,Flexible work practices. World class benefits. Informal working environment. Get to work with some amazing peers.,"It's with a heavy heart and reluctance that I share my review. Salesforce is an amazing company, however, within the department I work there is an overriding culture of insidious bullying, throwing people under the bus, lack of support, openness, coaching and development. Promotions are based not on your ability but for political reasons and whether your face fits, especially if you are able to 'toe the party line' and do not step out of line with the department head. This environment has been created and sustained over the last few years based on fear; if you are good at your job and have a point of view, no matter how professionally you express it you know your time is limited. The final result? A department which is wouldn't look out of place in North Korea, you would state black is white just to keep your job. It really is that bad. The worst of it is that this is known about at a very senior level and for some time and yet nothing is done to remove the perpetrator from the organisation. For fear of retribution I dare not share any further details, suffice to say that it's non-sales, and it's a department which should be the gold standard for promoting the Aloha culture. I'll leave it at that.",20 people found this review helpful

Good pay and benefits; overall package. Some nice perks.,"Very little interaction between business units makes for 'villages' in the main office. Lots of pressure on sales roles. More focus on sales than technology. Not being 'customer first'. Not a clear career progression path. Seemed to be much more about who you know than acting as a meritocracy. More effort should be put into making Salesforce a great place to work than there is making Salesforce *look like* a great place to work. Glossy brochures don't make up for the fact that you can't view payslips online. But the single worst part of working for Salesforce is the lack of an engaged HR department. So-called ""Employee Success"" are distant, hard to reach and ultimately unhelpful. From out of date processes (including faxes!) to archaic procedures and the simple fact that they don't engage on Chatter (the company's primary collaboration tool) at all.

The company endlessly trumpets its supposed wonderfulness to the point where it feels like working in an endless commercial. There seems to be a huge push to constantly market the company both externally *and* internally; having the 'culture' shoved down our throats constantly. The company seems to spend an awful lot of money on fluffy extras (like pillows for all employees to put their mobile phones on at their desks, and professionally produced promotional videos for internal-only items) whilst asking employees not to use Roaming Data whilst abroad on business, and only allowing VPs to fly comfortably (some are more equal than others in this Ohana). PR touts Salesforce as a cutting edge company, but back-office systems are ancient and technology stacks are not integrated after years - there is a big disconnect between PR and reality, but the 'Ohana' papers over the cracks. Every All Hands address starts with 10 minutes of pom-pom waving cheerleading about how amazing we are. It gets tiresome.",29 people found this review helpful
