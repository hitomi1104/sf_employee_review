0,Your experience here depends on luck,,3.0,"good brand name on resume, fast paced, you can learn a lot, smart coworkers. nice office. competitive salary.","Very top down company. Constantly changing directions with unreasonable deadlines to deliver--then change again! Every project is a fire drill. Frequent re-orgs, highly competitive and political, back-stabbing culture. Lots people burn out and quit. If you happen to end up in a team with a good leader who is part of the 'in-crowd' with his/her top management, you will probably do well. But again, that can change without much notice since re-orgs happen every 3 months. Think before you join. Not bad to get it on resume then move on",10 people found this review helpful
1,Tax Intern,,5.0,"Salesforce invests a lot into their employees. They want every member of their team to feel appreciated, excited to come to work, and to have the opportunity to change departments if they do not feel their current role is for them.

10,From riches to rags,,2.0,Great company 3 years ago. Then it tripled and went to the wolves. Work life balance is good. If you wanna sit and grow at a steady pace then it's great. Don't expect too many merit based incentives. Some free lunches. Easy to switch teams parallely. Vertical movement is easier for management. Horizontal movement is extremely scrutinized (they would rather hire inexperienced interns than in-house and train someone for a position) Company stocks are great. Bonuses are ok. Company has still a lot of room to grow which is great for its workers.,If you are the kind of person who thrives on appearance and taking credit for others work OR if you're a manager. Then this is the place for you. Work is not connected to pay. The impression of work is. Manager are pretty much guaranteed promotions every year if they don't distribute their budget on promoting their hires. I've known developer who've left because of this and also conscientious managers who were tired of playing the devil. Tripled in size in 3 years and the culture is no more. Now it's a hodgepodge of Microsoft and oracle.,15 people found this review helpful

70,Keep innovating....,,5.0,"1. Salesforce R&D has one of the best talent in software industry. 2. Despite being the best in what they do, people are accessible, down to earth and very polite. You can pretty much talk to engineers/managers at any level at any time. 3. I can't speak for the whole R&D, but I have never felt any politics in engineering teams yet. Most importantly, I have never heard anyone talking ill about someone behind their back. The environement is very positive and people love what they are doing. 4. You are given sufficient time to understand your project, see the big picture and get training. 5. Work life balance is great, I never had to work overtime or weekends, expect for the planned releases, for which you get comp day off.","Salesforce has over 15k employees, about 90% of them are sales guys, which I can not speak for. For R&D: 1. Hiring standards has been deteriorating day by day. We used to be really great at it, but now we are hiring people blindly. If we are to maintain the quality, we need to standardize the process, and learn from top tech companies(as we claim to be one). We pay pretty well compared to top tech firms in bay area, and I am sure with right interview process and effort from recruiters(hire more recruiters and tell them to reach out to everyone), we should we able to hire great engineers. 2. We have too many titles in R&D, this is great to keep employees motivated and promote them and I get that. BUT, you got to respect the title. I have seen people with very less experience and contributions, becoming Principle Engineers. I bet, these so called Principle Engineers, wont be able to pass entry level engineer's interview at a good tech company. PLEASE FIX THIS. 3. Another thing which is hurting the quality of engineering organization is letting QAs move to development without any interviews. I agree with the idea of allowing people to move between roles and do different things, but we must maintain the same interview standards while doing so. We all know that hiring standards for dev and QA are far apart, then letting QAs move to dev so easily has become a shortcut and no one is getting benefitted by this other than the individual. This hurts both dev team (as now they have to explain every line of code to QA) and it also hurts QA team as they will always have to hire new QAs (since the existing ones become dev) 4. I am not sure if this is salesforce or recruiters, but they dont give you good equity if you dont negotiate hard. The equity I have seen so far is around 50% of what a tech company in bay area (at our level) offers. 5. We have a great work culture at company, which is getting polluted by more and more higher management coming from Microsoft and Oracle. I always wonder, why we never get higher management from companies we admire (Google, Facebook, LinkedIn....). Now, these new managers are polluting the culture by thier micromanagement philosophy of earliest companies. For instance, now managers are asking receipt for $7 lunch arranged for a team meeting. This is not salesforce.",9 people found this review helpful

You will learn a lot, and still have plenty of time for your own personal life. The company genuinely respects their employees and looks after them. You really feel like they want to take care of you and they view you as a human being, not just a tool for their success. Customers genuinely love the product.

The role is challenging since you get questions from everybody at the client ecosystem, from junior developers to CIO and BA's to Business leaders. You constantly move from technically complex issues to IT Strategy, adoption, and other matters. Pretty demanding. If you get an out of town customer, then you will be traveling as well (generally at least 50% - can be more). Evenings can be quite lonely since you are the only person from Salesforce services at this customer site.",7 people found this review helpful

You are absolutely surrounded by brilliant people that want nothing more than to help you learn and be successful. Team members are amazing to work with. Everyone works together.","You create your own way at Salesforce. You must be confident in your strengths and self aware of your weaknesses. They will not create that path for you, you have to do it. For some that is great, for others they need that plan laid out. Management can only help you so much in that. For a company growing this fast there are positions created everyday. You must have patience and savvy to find the next right role for yourself. Management will guide you, but you own your career. There isn't a defined path. You aren't always going to know all the options available. It's a very fast paced environment. For everyone to work together they must communicate well. This means seeking to understand, asking the right questions, and being flexible. In sales this requires confidence and humility, not arrogance. Egos can get in the way if they aren't controlled.

But a decent one.,"Apr 22, 2015 - Anonymous Employee",4.0,"Good and fair (not outrageously amazing) pay, benefits, stock options, and there's a system for everything. You want access to all your recent pay stubs? Instant list of all your maternity leave guidelines? All info is easy to access when it comes to HR. Salesforce is flexible when you need a few hours off for a doctor's appointment or something. If you have a role where you get to travel, you get to stay in nice hotels and have a cushy budget for meals.","Main cons are that it's a huge corporation and things get done sloowwwwly compared to startups and smaller companies. No matter what your role, it seems there's someone else doing the exact same thing in a different part of the company who is completely siloed from you, and it all gets very confusing. Projects take a long time to complete because a million people need to approve. Many people just don't reply to emails or show up to meetings because they're ""too busy."" Still, I think it's a 4-star workplace because you can easily do good work and get paid well without stressing yourself out too much. My work-life balance is pretty good here compared to smaller companies that are more stressful, so in that sense it's a win.",1 person found this review helpful

Also, the company has a firm commitment to personal growth, that is enforced. Nice to see the teeth in the process.

Decent benefits Lots of left over food from catered lunches for meetings.,"As with any big company, the team you are on can drastically change your experience here but I am going to try to point out some of the general things. Also of note, before you read too much into the other reviews, take the time to notice how many of the 5 star reviews are can be summed up by ""great place to work but has growing pains"" or ""you get what you put in, slackers need not apply"". I will let you draw your own conclusion on why so many of these reviews sound like marketing message .... It doesnt look like ExactTarget understands that they are no longer a startup. The only people that thrive at ExactTarget are people that have no lives. 50+ hours of work a week is the norm and anyone that does less is considered a ""slacker"" as you might have seen in some of these other reviews. If you do the math, you'll realize that the decent paycheck, which is typically higher than the industry norm, ultimately falls woefully short when you look at how much you make an hour. As you work here, you come to find out that it is very much a cult mindset and you are either in or out. Job security comes from owning tribal knowledge of projects that are integrated in to the platform since documentation is apparently a running joke. There are many processes that have been implemented to ""streamline"" development but apparently the management style here is to implement ""solutions"" and ignore the results because the only thing that these processes have done is add one more point of failure to an already broken system. Contractors are treated as second class citizens. Its common knowledge. The way to get ahead is to brown nose and give up on life outside work. ET is founded on the principle that the reward for a job well done is an opportunity to do more.

The worst changes to the company have come in at the beginning of 2015. Quality Engineering was de-prioritized across the R&D organization. Many of the QE execs have been given different roles (I am not complaining about this. To be fair, many of these so-called QE execs should be fired. Do we really need 10 VPs in Quality Engineering? QE heads are now reporting to development managers. The road ahead points to converting all teams to Engineering teams. So if you are a QE trying to get a job, look elsewhere. Do not listen to the drivel from the recruiters. QE ROLE IS ENDING AT SALESFORCE! Added to this, the conflicting priorities are ever increasing in this company. R&D is at its 3rd attempt to re-write the UI, and make it adaptive at the same time. The so-called Salesforce 1 app was a disaster. The next attempt is starting in 2015. Although there is not a lot of hope for it, many of the ""leaders"" driving this will surely make hay via promotions and stock grants.",Be the first to find this review helpful
238,"Unless you are Sales, stay away.",,1.0,The barista is a total sweetheart. Their offices are nice too... but putting lipstick on a pig doesn't make it pretty.,"For being a tech company, this place could not keep anyone in IT for longer than 2 years, it seemed. Salesforce has a ridiculous hierarchy that is rather militant in the way it handles internal communications (""My door is always open; however, you better not come to me before person a, b, c, and d""). There is 0 transparency although they preach this in every pointless meeting they make you sit through. This company caters heavily to the Sales side of business, and no where else. If you are IT in any sense of that side of business, then you can expect to be held to your best performing day for your entire career no matter how much of an outlier that day was, if you prove to be competent with what you do you can expect to be overloaded with work enough for those who are not, and then held to their expectations on top of your own. Oh, and those people will get promoted before you, because you are too ""valuable"" to move from your spot. And you can never expect to hear what you do right; every 1:1 you have with management is everything that you could possibly be doing better, always. No thanks, no 'atta-boys, nothing. You think you have co-workers in other departments? The people you assist are your companies User's that you support? Maybe these co-workers/users are your future friends/buddies? No. You have customers. And you treat them as such at all times. Your co-workers for the first few months of being hired are pretty great typically, until the vibe of this company is finally realized; which leads them into the cutthroat, every (wo)man for his/herself environment that management breeds. As a cherry on the top; Salesforce has this underlying community called femmeforce. Now this could be innocent, and it could potentially do a lot of great things; however this is not what it is being used for and many of the current management are women who are extremely active in this community for the wrong reasons. In our office 90% of the people who are leaving/being bullied out are male, and 70-80% of the new hires are women. The obvious preferential treatment, and the lack of others who care enough to do anything about it is ulimately why I left this company. I performed in the top 5 of a 40+ member team consistently across all stats; closures, professionalism, ""customer"" satisfaction, SLA; however, I was still offered an ultimatum: a severance package that is really hard to look away from, or the promise of an official write up that would not go the way I wanted, just because I was male working under a radical feminist. That is not a joke, and not an exaggeration.",24 people found this review helpful
239,Not the Typical Corporate America,,5.0,"I enjoy my flexible schedule to allow a healthy work life balance. My benefits are second to none with wellness buck reimbursement, employee stock purchasing, our company and floating holiday schedule, opportunities for quarterly bonuses, and outstanding healthcare.

245,Unprofessional ethics and top management,,1.0,Enthusiastic lower level developers and engineers,"The top level management like directors , program managers are pretty immature and behave unprofessionally. They poke their nose in matters where they are not supposed to. Obvious they dont have lot of work to do and just jump in every meeting and talk nonsense.Consulting for salesforce has been painful. They have irrelevant personal conversations in the meetings which annoys consultants from other firms. Still they are behaving like a start up company and never being matured. The height of immaturity is when they make fun of other company's boss and consultants right in front of them.",12 people found this review helpful
