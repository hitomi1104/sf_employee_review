0,BDA SDR BDR experience,,4.0,"Solid company, good for your resume If you work in a customer facing role (pre sales sales post sales) you will really get solid work experience which will help you in all your future roles forever Market leader Great product to sell Benefit on par with other tech companies in Dublin Management gets a lot of training Access to a lot of training/personal development course Really a lot of opportunities for networking, people believe in it and act accordingly","The location is awful, it is depressing to work not in the city center - yes they’re moving to the docks but it’s still pretty far from downtown and won’t happen before 2021 No food - just some snacks, and pretty bad/unhealthy ones. These 2 points might seem trivial, but you will spend quite a lot of money on Luas and food, trust me, not to mention the time lost when commuting Career progression is there BUT it is extremely slow, which means it also takes a lot of years to move out of Dublin if you want to stay with the same company (4/5 years) It takes a lot of networking to move between functions (BDR to SE or CS) Harsh split of fixed and variable salary in AE roles (50-50) Level of stress always depends on the manager you get There’s not much of a fun element at work, besides the people, who are for the most part lovely and motivated. But no fun company kick off abroad, no cool off sites abroad, no happy hours, no end of quarter drinks... just compare it to other big tech company like Linkedin and Google - it’s much more boring The WFH policy for sales dev is non existent (1 day/month). Pretty ridiculous when this is an EMEA HQ and people are coming from all over. Allow people to go home and work from there to see their families, without having to take PTO all the time. Politics - it is a corporation, so it is political. It’s very clear that sometimes people get a role over others just because they are better liked, not because of their skills. Always need to show your best face which can be exhausting",3 people found this review helpful

25,Incredible company & products - Increasingly farcical sales roles,"Nov 20, 2019 - Account Executive in Dublin, Dublin",4.0,"Being the market leader across a wide range of solutions is an enviable position to be in. Customers are typically willing to discuss and engage with you based on our reputation alone. There are some highly intelligent and capable people right throughout the organization. This means that projects and evaluations can become very creative and the standard of work is typically incredibly high. It is by the far best place I have worked in terms of learning from those around you. The benefits are second to none, including health insurance, gym membership, fertility/adoption allowance, generous maternity/paternity leave, a degree of informal flexi-time. The offices are decent, with fresh fruit and snacks available. There are a wide variety of career options available, both internally and also externally due to the expanse of the Salesforce ecosystem. Altruistic culture runs right through Salesforce and is truly ""lived"" as opposed to being just talked about.","There is a real lack of cohesion to the sales organization. When you first join you are pretty left to fend for yourself and see to your own integration. The sales targets are completely ridiculous and the compensation plan has been making it more difficult to make money every year. This year I am going to make approximately €25-40k (depending how my year finishes) less than the average of my last two years. The overall attainment figures for sales people are in the toilet. This will not be made clear during your interview and will not be openly discussed with management as to what a realistic quota should be. This ultimately has created a toxic environment where people feel undervalued due to their inability to hit an unrealistic target. In theory, everyone can make good money. In reality 90% of people will miss their target and the majority of commissions will be left in the hands of the few. The increasing product offering of Salesforce brings problems in terms of collaboration. It is not always easy to find the right person for the right meeting in good time. This can make it difficult for customers to do business with us, as the sales process can become protracted. While career options are varied, the criteria for promotion isn't ever clear. It is often a case of 10 people interviewing not knowing how many roles will be filled, not knowing when they will find out and unclear feedback as to why they did/didn't get the role. Naturally this has caused people to question the process.",9 people found this review helpful

Overall it's impossible not to say this is a great working experience, even if it ends up being a valuable chapter in a larger career.","The base salary is relatively poor although the ability to make commission can be massive. With that said, it comes down to the companies you're working with and there are plenty of very talented people at Salesforce doing poorly for this reason. The inverse applies as well - although the overall people standard is high there are some with mediocre talent and effort who stumble blindly into huge paydays. Also, when you're in you're in – you tend to only view the world through the lens of Salesforce.",4 people found this review helpful
45,"The good, the bad and the ugly",,3.0,"Very smart people. Super collaborative. Good pay and benefits.

Inspiring people and vision and a strong desire to try and do right by the customer. Also deliver amazing events globally.",Very sales focused and growth targets are very aggressive. Career opportunities are surprisingly limited and very talented people can get stuck in roles for years as the structure is so flat in marketing and the team is so lean that there’s often nowhere to go. Management is also very hit and miss. Some are great and others are incompetent. This inconsistency means that those under good managers do well and those under bad managers get stuck. The company needs to invest more in training people to be leaders and coaches rather than just putting them in charge due to tenure. Workload can be extremely high and overwhelming so it takes a while to work out how to get by without burning out. Also tend to employ highly experienced people to do a lot of execution as headcount is so limited they need to hire people who can create a strategy and execute it. This leads to frustration among people who could be doing so much more but get stuck in the detail of delivery.,14 people found this review helpful

53,Not a good place to work. Unequal territories,,1.0,"Good benefits, Free snacks","I was with Salesforce for a year. When I started I was made a lot of promises regarding the territories being fair within the team. However, once I got my territory and saw how it was compared to other territories across the team, I realized that 80% of the territories in any given team are bad. Only 20% of the accounts/territories are good and in which the sales people make money. And Management knows this. So if you are an Account Executive aligned well with Management, you are set. However, if you are like the 80% of the account executives, your fate is NOT in your hands as you will get bad accounts. They know this. The management's objective at least in the Toronto office is to only have 20% of the people make their #. They dont want anyone to be 200% of their #. They expect 80% of the reps to miss their #. The territories are extremely disparate. There's a lot of partiality in who gets what accounts. Be very careful when you join as an AE. For other roles like Marketing, Ops etc I've heard its a good place to work. However, for Sales its just like any other company. Dont fall for their lies when they tell you that the territories are fair. To give you a specific example, in the Toronto office there is one person who has 10 president's clubs. He makes a lot of money and his manager and his manager's manager are as expected totally aligned. He is a good rep. However, so are others on the team. However since he has always had the best territory the makes club every single year. Its ridiculous. If you've been in sales for a while, and comes across an environment where ONE person has made club 10 times and every one else has made club 1-2 times in the last 10 years, what would you conclude. The territories are uneven. The management is inept. For example this is the first company that I've come across where the Sales Manager's quota is not aligned with the team. For example in a team of 10 sales reps which a quota of $1M each, the manager doesnt have a $10M quota. His/her quota is way less than that. So even if the team misses their #, the manager makes his/her #. I had never seen that in my sales career. So to get promoted to a manager's role, you need to be connected to the right people. Be very careful in joining this company. For Sales its not as advertised. For other roles it might be different.",22 people found this review helpful

This may be a plus if you have that attitude, otherwise you will find it frustrating. Due to this, management is represented by some excellent managers and others who are not but have been good in leveraging the above. Salesforce as a family: you are expected to be enthusiastic, participate and promote all sort of social events they serve you.

83,Waste of time,"Jun 5, 2019 - Anonymous Employee in Hyderābād",5.0,Pay Package and benefits. Best facilities provided by the organisation.,"Worst management - They will never listen to you. They'll only do what they want to do and all your ideas will be given to others and they are projected as their ideas. Totally biased and even after multiple feedbacks with the proofs they do not want to accept. They will always tell, there's more to come in the future stay tuned. It's not about promotions or hike percentages. It's about ethics and integrity which the management will oversee always. Sometimes it's clearly evident and visible to everyone in the team that something wrong is happening and the local leadership in Hyderabad, never want to fix it. They just want to bypass it saying the (people who get support from management) trying to do something extra why don't you support him instead of giving feedback. Later, the people who actually want to work as a team and share some feedback with the managers will be targeted big time and will be treated as like slaves or even worst them, Support - Worst support that I have seen in the service industry. These guys never understand its a product based support, not a BPO. With Salesforce having three releases a year with all upgradations & patches, it will be difficult for a support person to keep up to date all the time. The worst way of calculation with regards to the headcount. They say they're hiring people but for a quarter 50 people for a backlog and burden of thousands of cases is not working. Outdated metrics are being used to calculate productivity and other year-end calculations. Employee Success or HR: Apart from very few members Zaira Banu & Rajesh I do not see others responding to the questions raised by the employees. I'm not biased towards the above two but however, their work speaks for themselves. Now coming to the recruitment, Salesforce always recommends the employees to refer people to the organisation, however, the recruitment or referral process is worst (there is no other least word for this). I have referred around 10 profiles to this organisation, all the profiles haven't been considered. They stay in the first or second stage for almost 2 to 3 months and then the status changes to No longer in consideration. When we try to contact the recruiter there will be no response. FYI, the above mentioned 10 profiles have been selected in other organisations for better positions and better packages. It's clearly evident on the floor that there is an agreement between the manager and the respective team member. The team member will refer people and the respective manager will select that profile. Once the team member gets the referral bonus it will be shared by the team member(who referred to the profile) and the manager who recruited.",17 people found this review helpful

Worst office politics I've experienced - conflicting goals across teams created tension between managers which trickled down to staff. Goal posts were constantly changing and never reaching a resolve. One particular manager was notoriously difficult to work with and had a reputation for bullying, playing favouritism, and making most people feel uncomfortable by employing a management style of intimidation. Despite multiple HR violations against him for his aggressive behaviour, nothing was ever done to rectify it. You're not encouraged to work as a team, but instead, encouraged to develop ways of getting ahead of others through sometimes unethical means. Middle management will overlook any unethical, throwing-under-the-bus behaviours if it means you help them hit their numbers and make them look good. Nurtures a cutthroat environment of arrogance and greed.

If you're hired as ""Success Agent Tier-2"" for CRM support then your Salesforce career is over because you'll be working in a specific skill group (Configuration, Usage or Email team) and do not get any chance to explore the real Salesforce CRM tool. 2. Management do not to monitor/plan their employees leaves(PTO's) properly which again makes very difficult to work with a huge backlog of cases. You can expect 25-30 cases per agent in AMER shift or 30-35 cases per agent in EMEA shift. NOTE: I have worked in Wipro (worst of all IT companies) so I am very well aware of overload/ extra amount of work. 3. They do not have enough ""Tier-3"" resource which makes your life miserable because as Tier-2, you'll be the only point of contact for the customer who has raised a case. If customer escalates the case or gives you DSAT due to the delay in resolution, then it won't affect Tier-3's performance. Management will simply blame you. 4. So many bugs/ Known issues in every major releases which will make you cry like hell as a support agent. 5. If you ask CSG management to hire more resources to reduce the back log, they'll simply say - ""No we cannot because we do not have enough budget"". 6. HR team sends out an employee survey link in each quarter but that doesn't make any change in your work life. 7. Also when it comes to ""Employee referral""(if your friends, relatives or siblings gets hired then you get $2000/each) program in Hyderabad is one of the most ""Corrupted"" program they've. I have seen 3 examples of corruption in referrals where managers referred their siblings who has really good terms with the ""hiring manager"". They all got selected and each manager earned easy $2000 + Family member (as a salesforce employee). So again if you're hired as Success agent Tier-2 then forget about referring anyone. 8.

132,Great place to work,"Dec 10, 2016 - Product Marketing Manager in Munich, Bavaria",4.0,Excellent pay and great benefits. Salesforce offers an entire range of non-pay related benefits that I have not seen in other companies. Salesforce.org allows you to spend company time for charity and other non-profit related projects. The people are smart and fun to work with. You'll never get bored of your work since the company is developing rapidly and touches so many different business processes. Hence as an employee you can have a direct impact on our customers success.,"The organization is growing rapidly, hence new members of staff from different companies with different organizational structures and cultures are joining. Management needs to ensure that Salesforce's original culture is preserved. This counts for senior level employees with directs as well as for young professionals.

Late night messages and sometimes those bringing call for action for next morning.. And this is getting worse as all management layers feel the need to “contribute”.. - Customer success has changed to customer second; this is confirmed as common view in recent employee survey. It’s all about running the revenue up, on cost of some customers being outright screwed over under time pressure from us. It’s terrible to see this change, having been following this great company for many years. - You get promoted by making your numbers. You can be as disrespectful to Salesforce values as you wish to be, as far as the numbers are on the board. This is not a nice environment to work in. This is a shark tank.. - We are taught to be hustlers. We make stories of how great the prices are in certain month and how my manager has a budget for the extra discounts He would like to spend with you as a special customer. Big news: the discounts are always available for those willing to actually buy and there are no budgets for “special discounts”.. The only big diversion from this is January, when it truly is a buyers market. - It is high pressure, always. - Office is too full, and no home office allowed. - Ohana, trust, customer success - these are just words in Sales slides.",22 people found this review helpful

High pressure on 30% YOY growth. 95% of AEs don´t hit monthly targets which creates a lot of low morale across the board.

157,Salesforce - A company where everyone wants everyone to succeed,"Jul 18, 2017 - Business Development Representative in Singapore",5.0,"Senior leader in HQ once said, many companies have an onboarding process that likens a rock tumbler. Salesforce's onboarding likens a car wash. Gentle and gets the same result. This has been my experience so far as a new hire. People around are always looking out for you to make sure you can cope. There's a level of trust and faith that you'll ramp up to be productive in the company. I'll list just a few reasons why Salesforce is the number one place to work. Culture- many of us would agree that it's challenging to explain what working in salesforce is like to those who are not inside, simply because it's rare to find a culture as unique as Salesforce'. When you're in the company, you get a sense of positivity day in and day out, everyone wants to get to know you as a person, it's not just work, it's the person behind the work. You will also feel that every single person in the company sincerely wants you to succeed. From the enablement team equipping you with tools and resources to succeed, to Employee Success (more commonly known outside as HR) taking care of your wellbeing, to your sales leaders leading from the front to win with you, the company's values of trust and growth resonates deeply in the employees. Salesforce is particular about who gets hired in the company. It's not so much of your competency (though it's important), as it is of your character and how you work with people. If you like to outsmart others and constantly seek personal glory, you're not going to have a good time. Leadership - I believe a huge part of the success culture in salesforce stems from the leadership team. Of course, salesforce hires great managers who can already lead and motivate team, but there's a proper coaching system which enables each employee to align with the direction of our leaders vision quickly, and also improve performance. Think professional athlete teams. Continuous training and learning - we get a ton of training and resources on industry trends, salesforce products, professional skills like giving effective feedback etc. There's a proper system in place for those who want to develop their competencies or gain more knowledge. Even staff who are here for many years benefit from the training and development programs. The fun 'stuff' - you get wellness reimbursements (some get gym memberships, some get supplements, you can use it for most physical activities). There're also many team activities and celebrations which makes work a whole lot more fun. We also have 7 days volunteering time off where you can do it with the team or on your own. Big shoutout to the team in Singapore for making Salesforce the number one place to work!",IT industry changes very fast and processes changes from time to time. You have to be adaptable and focus on what matters,7 people found this review helpful

159,6 months in Salesforce,"Apr 29, 2019 - Anonymous Employee",2.0,Salary and benefits are competitive. Internal processes are in place and they work fairly well. There are lot of opportunities as the company is still growing. Solid product and great customers.,"Company has grown so much it feels it has trouble keeping up with itself. Company utilizes Google GSuite which doesn't work too smoothly with Apple or Microsoft products and hardware. You can get your work done, but if you are used to select your own tools or if you come from a Microsoft dominated environment you better be prepared for this as the impact to your productivity may be big in the beginning. The biggest problem to me has been that the Senior Management is not always on a level that I would expect them to be. There is a lot of variance in how they set the expectations, support their subordinates and especially how they present themselves as leaders. Maybe it is bad luck or maybe I'm not the right fit for the company, but this has also made me consider my options with other employers.",8 people found this review helpful

Lot's of swag and everyone is getting injected with the Ohana spirit from the beginning. 7 days of volunteer work per year is paid and organized by the company, which makes it very easy to connect with people from other teams as well. Plenty of learning opportunities thanks to their company own Trailhead learning environment, paid certifications that are highly valuable on the market at the moment. Free snacks, fruits and soft drinks.","No information has been given beforehand that a certain amount of certifications had to be passed first, which comes as an utter surprise to everyone when they start and is adding a lot of pressure to an already stressful situation as a new hire. It was already suspicious that half of the team got rehired at the same time, but it turned out that this team had generally an extremely high turnover. The job itself was absolutely not challenging as it was merely an entry-level position, but immediately after joining we got told that there is a hiring freeze for the next months. It turned out that nobody for years had been given the chance to move to other teams. I got yelled at by the manager in the most unprofessional way and learned that this was normal there in this team. Well, it's not normal and absolutely not acceptable at all! I can only warn everyone to join who hopes this position could be a good start with Salesforce. It's a dead-end street!

234,8 years in and I love this place,"Jun 17, 2015 - Regional Sales Manager in Toronto, ON",5.0,"This review will probably come off biased as I've spent the last 8 years at SF and have grown my career with the company. I also met my wife at SF and we now have a lovely 2 year old daughter so suffice to say the decision to work here has proved a good one personally as well as professionally. I started fresh out of university with no idea what CRM or cloud computing was in a biz dev role, progressed into sales and am now a sales manager. Here are the top reasons I love SF: - upward mobility: the company is growing 30% YoY and with growth comes opportunity. I've held 6 positions in 8 years working here. - people & culture: I'm humbled on a daily basis by the people I work with. SF employees are smart, ambitious, fun and tend to genuinely care about the communities we work in and the world around us. There are exceptions to every rule, of course, but by and large we're a hard-working, fun-loving, high-achieving group that is just as collaborative as we are competitive. - pay: money talks! Compensation and benefits are top notch. For those in sales, the base pay will seem low but in 8 years I've never made less than 30% more than my OTE (base + commission). - trust: the vast majority of the people I've reported to have instilled a lot of trust in me to get my job done without interfering or micro-managing my day-to-day.","Pace: SF moves fast. Change is constant. You need to be comfortable being uncomfortable. This is not for everyone. If you're looking to rest on your laurels in a comfy position, you need not apply. Fiscal Year: this is a petty gripe but a valid one. The SF fiscal year ends January 31st, which means Christmas/New Year timeframe is one of the our busiest times of year. Taking vacation in December/January is highly discouraged given it's the busy season, not ideal if you're accustomed to taking time off for the holidays. Cross-Functional Collaboration: compared with most companies I've seen, we do a great job of collaborating across departments/functions to get the job done. Some would say we're world class in this department, but as a SF veteran my expectations are high and I think we can do better. At times certain departments feel misaligned and for us to continue growing we need to move as one tightly aligned organization.",1 person found this review helpful

239,Heroku,"Jul 30, 2018 - Principal Member of Technical Staff",5.0,"Heroku has had its ups and downs over the last few years as it has become more integrated with the larger Salesforce org, but it still feels staffed by the best minds in the business, and I love the product that we make. Salesforce itself has all the pros and cons of a large org, complete with hawaiian culture kool-aid and large-org inertia, but on the whole it feels like Benioff puts his money where his mouth is on societal issues, in a way that few corporate titans do. They're generous when it comes to family and benefits and have a corporate culture of giving. Inside Heroku, we are still a little bit inside our purple-tinted bubble. On balance it feels like the engineers, junior to senior, are a standard deviation or two above the median. The problems we solve are difficult and satisfying. The business is large and the opportunity remains even larger. It feels miraculous that we operate a product at such crazy scale with so few people, and speaks to our expertise in building scalable, automated things.","These are more Heroku issues than Salesforce issues. We were (and still are) strapped for headcount over many years. This leads to serious team health issues and burnout. Exec is keenly aware of the issue and taking steps to fix it, but it should never have gotten this bad. At the moment, our product org is also sorely understaffed following turnover and departures, which means that many engineering teams don't have anyone to help them make sound product choices. We get by, but the product roles are critical, and the product managers we have are spread way too thin. As above, our exec team is aware of the problem and trying to hire as fast as they can. These are short- to medium-term issues. I believe they'll get worked out and we'll have smoother sailing in a few months. Longer term, my larger concern is complacency. I don't know if Heroku/Salesforce has the gumption to make the big bets to really grow our business and remain relevant for the next epoch. For the last decade we've made it drastically simpler to run compute workloads in the cloud, and it's built a large and successful business. With containerization catching on and tooling becoming more mature, we're being commoditized. I don't know that exec has the appetite to determine what the next ""git push heroku master"" is, and allocate enough resources to pursue it. That feels like an existential threat.",1 person found this review helpful

251,"Still a great place to be, but getting more corporate","Dec 15, 2016 - in London, England",4.0,"Fantastic people and culture, especially at the field and mid-level range. Incredible technology and very smart acquisition strategy. Really, with the exception of maybe Google, this is the only place to be in tech, in terms of making an impact on the way the world does business. Also, the (genuine) philanthropic focus remains strong and helps in fostering a very strong team culture.","Further up the EMEA org the Ohana culture does seem to be getting ""thinner"" and is more of a word than a genuine way of working. Especially in the enterprise sales organisation there can be some ""prima-donna"" behaviour - seems there are some top sales people in leadership positions based on their sales skills rather than their leadership skills.",2 people found this review helpful
252,"Great pay, culture & expectations - not so much",,2.0,"- Great pay - Great benefits - Well known, fast growing company - Supportive management** (contingent on your patch) ** - not all managers are like this from my experience of discussion with others","- Constant changes (whether to which team you're on, or your job description) - Promotion path is convuluted (interview, get approved, and they decide they want to close the position and then constantly will make you re-interview for the same position you were once approved for. Could be waiting 4 months+ after acceptance - Work hard, and only hard. Play doesn't really exist here. - Passive aggressive directors that will never tell you ""Good job"" when hitting 100% of your metrics, micro-focused - Culture isn't what it's cracked up to be (sadly). Backstabbing, and bullying tendencies from other team members - business makes the best decisions for the business completely not acknowledging the toll it puts on employees (ie. 35% YoY growth, which is great, but comes with a cost) - Work life balance in positions that come after BDR are apparently non-existent",10 people found this review helpful

265,Never been treated with such disrespect,,2.0,"I loved the office in the tower. The verdant shrubbery, vibrant colour, frequent events and culinary freebies made it an eclectic space to work in. Unfortunately the 7 functioning floors were overcapacity by 200 people which made things a little tight and meant there was little space to eat and sometimes even work! The benefits are amazing. Loads of discounts, vitality health, company Amex and comprehensive expensing system. It really felt like a privilege to be there. The internal tools and external products are very robust. It seemed as though everyone was very tidy, intelligent and mostly friendly. The companies and teams are quite siloed though so it’s rare that you’d interact with many people. There are so many people that you rarely bump into the same person twice in the same week. there are apps and people for everything. The onboarding is quite slick if a little cultish. There’s a big emphasis on happiness and inclusion.","Unfortunately for a company claiming to have an keen eye on equality and trust, it lets a few things slip through the net: I was called aside following an evening out with colleagues whilst off campus. A department head had reported me after being open about my sexuality in a private conversation. I’m not sure why they felt that was necessary; I wasn’t given any specifics, only that it made them uncomfortable although they didn’t mention this during the conversation! Anyway a few days later I was summoned to HR and I was handed my notice. No warning. No chance to defend myself. It’s a pity because the pay was really good. The internal recruiter who hired me was lovely. The work didn’t seem challenging enough yet however and there was too much process and planning in my opinion. I guess you just have to be careful whom you confide in when you work at a big co. At least my new job allows me to bring my dog to work.",9 people found this review helpful

272,Amazing company depending what you are looking for in your Cv,"May 14, 2019 - Senior Account Executive in Madrid",3.0,"- Pretty good OTE for the region plus excellent benefits (retirement plan , health and life insurance, ticket restaurant, wellness reimbursement, car allowance, ESPP,... - Product suit is amazing (even better the vision and marketing salesforce creates around them) Salesforce is really smart expanding the portfolio with additional product that add value into the stack and allow AEs to position further value depending the industry you are focus on (Marketing , service , commerce , mulesoft ...) (B2B B2C) - Really smart guys supporting the daily operations and business. You will have all the support from different areas of the organisation. - 95 up to 100 sales guys in tech would pay to have the opportunity to work in the number 1 Saas company worldwide. Nice to have in your c - Salesforce gives you the chance to work on amazing projects you would have the chance being in a different company.","Some disadvantages are coming from the advantages indeed: - It’s really difficult to make good money. Target are increasing and OTE are reflected based on global plans , so it depends a lot on how lucky you are you will be able to reach your targets. - You will have to manage the relationship not just with your direct reporting, but wih different stakeholders who will have different interests. As an example, different AEs from different vertical products interested in selling into the same account, different RVPs to manage with. Alignment is one of the most important words in the company. Some days you will finalise your day thinking about how 90% of your calls were to manage talks with colleagues and not customers/ partners. - Depending on the area you are focus in, territory can be really big or small. This comes with the maturity of the product in the market. Per example , Core products AEs are really focus in small territories, however new products in the Org (Mulesoft, Commerce ,...) counts with small teams yet. These AEs are focus in strategic deals and normally cannot support all the opportunities properly. At the end, quotas are increasing because of new products in the portfolio , but you cannot have the same level of support like in mature ones. So I would say it depends how lucky you are with an specific account your co prime could make a big piece of the quota. - I don’t personally believe you have to be the best sales person in the world to sell in Salesforce. Marketing investment and resources are super huge, some customers buy the vision and what they see in events many times , plus there is plenty of really experienced partners in the region. I would say your results at the end of the year will depend 30% of your work and 70% how lucky you are with your territory , maturity of your account and the work of your co-primes - If you like the start uptype of experience , this is not a place where you will be comfortable for a long time (I must confess smaller regions like Iberia are closer to a start up type of company thought ) However, sometimes you will have the feeling you will spend more time reporting, reading Quips, covering different events, than thinking strategically how to gain relationships, trust and projects. - This company can help you win good money, but reducing your health due to stress and long time at work. Work life balance is challenging. There is not an ending point , you will have to be really good Managing this point to have everyone happy : you (and your health , your closer family (that will have to be open on you travelling and spending long hours at work, and the company) This point is being really important. Some people are leaving , or thinking about doing it, because of this last reason. Retaining employees is key for the company. Many important people use to leave (mostly coming from the acquisitions) because they don’t get use to the way the company operates. A lot of people are ex oracles, this can creates a local culture where not anyone might be confortable with.",10 people found this review helpful
