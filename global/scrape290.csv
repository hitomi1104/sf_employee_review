0,Unbelievable opportunity and Culture,"Jan 28, 2020 - Director in San Francisco, CA",5.0,"- Employee work life balance is actually working - Commitment to Society and Community are not just marketing slogans but are deeply embedded in culture - Management listens, respects opinions and takes actions - Unbelievable opportunity in terms of what you can work on and what you can create - Safe environment you can spend a life time here and not worry","- Lack of full stack experience for developers, you do more configuration than building - Speed can slow down due to excessive stress on collaboration and alignment - Some legacy elements, that need cleanup, but nothing that one cannot handle given everything else in place",Be the first to find this review helpful

4,"Great Role, Expected Responsibilities, Good Management, Comforting Covid Response.","Nov 23, 2020 - Sales Strategy Analyst in San Francisco, CA",4.0,"The role is as expected. It allows for experimentation in process and areas for improvement, while considering the historical context of why something is the way it is. Being entirely remote (because of COVID) since beginning, there is good work/life balance. The company has given WFH Stipends for employees and has excellent communication in the form of All Hands meetings (very frequent) and email communications. I feel respected for my experience, and not pressured on my performance. We are all in the same boat, so we all have essentially similar expectations. The pay is good, as are the benefits (I expect would be better if work was in person). From what I understand, the promotion and salary reconsideration processes are fair and equitable.","There are a lot of processes in these roles that could be consolidated company-wide (or at least department-wide), that are not, which often times results in duplicate work or straying from the norm. Those processes need to be standardized. Sometimes it is hard to feel like a dialogue flows between colleagues, which is expected in an all remote environment, but a challenge nonetheless. The same goes for culture building, but efforts are being made, and I expect this to be more of a result of Remote work, and not the team/department. Processes often are overly complicated and should be assessed to whether or not they add value or could be simplified.",Be the first to find this review helpful

34,Best company I've worked for to date. Highly recommend joining the Salesforce team,"Jul 25, 2015 - Anonymous Employee in San Francisco, CA",5.0,"-Huge emphasis on the importance of charitable giving and being environmentally sustainable (backed by 6 paid volunteer days per employee annually, $5000 annual employee match for charitable giving, frequent internal charitable events) -Prioritizes engaging employees by aligning personal career goals with each employee's duties and encouraging movement between functions and departments throughout the company -Incredibly intelligent workforce: Salesforce is able to use its strong brandname to hire only the top talent and as a result has an environment where you are constantly challenged and learning, which continuously develops your own skill set. (Less than 1% of applicants receive employment offers) -Strong community environment: Salesforce has been able to build a corporate family unlike any company I've been a part of before. People honestly care for each other and will go out of their way to look out for past and present employees. Salesforce focuses on working as a team rather than separate individuals which develops a sense of inclusion. -Incredible parties: Salesforce certainly caters to a more extroverted, lively and connected personality by having frequent social and networking events throughout the year -$100/mth employee fitness benefit and health benefits that are largely absorbed by the company. Free yoga classes and espresso bars are also offered in some offices -Offices are generally situated in the heart of cities rather than in suburbs",-Headcount growing perhaps too quickly which could transform the community feel to a more corporate environment -Does not offer full meals (light snacks and beverages are provided) -Signals of a more corporate future ahead evidenced by a shift away from local vendors to their global competitors,62 people found this review helpful

(And I started during the pandemic work from home era) I have never had such kind and compassionate coworkers. The culture is not just talked about, it is lived and emulated throughout the company. The compensation and benefits are at the top of the industry standards. The leaders here truly care for those that work under them, and wellbeing is something that is emphasized and preached. Honestly, I have never been happier at a job before. I love working at Salesforce and don't see myself leaving anytime soon (or ever!)","Because Salesforce is in such an innovative industry, change is a constant.

However, for those of us who are in the services side of the business, the resources and enablement materials at our disposal is not as bountiful as they are, for say, SEs and AEs, so we not set up for success as much, making the job more difficult. - While Salesforce often says they put the customer at the center of everything they do, those who are not customer facing sometimes lack the ability to put themselves in customer shoes, but those of us who do interact with customers rely upon other internal teams to make them successful, so often times the biggest challenge is navigating our massive organization and hoping you'll be able to get the attention of the person who can help, and hoping they have the resources and time to help your customer.",Be the first to find this review helpful

227,"Great Company, Less than Great Role, Worse Managers",,3.0,"- Great company overall, highly respected, great reputation - Lots of training and resources (overwhelming at times) - SOME great leaders in different parts of the business - Great benefit - Company core values are upheld - I feel like upper-level leadership is very transparent and trustworthy - Cool customer stories and products - Innovation","- The biggest shock to me: how bad lower-level management is. Idk where these people came from but they are micromanaging, unrealistic, unhelpful, insulting...like the list really goes on. Maybe my expectations were too high coming to this amazing company but there needs to be more training for leaders. - Promotion process is terrible, you're expected to ""network"" to find any answers to anything and it ends up being a huge waste of time more often than not. And don't even think about leaving the sales org. Managers don't help and People across the company look down on BDRs. Also, the pay compared to other places is not good at all. $50K base in seat and after you promote to the next step. OTE increases in next role but not base salary no matter what you promo into. - High metrics, low commission - Like any other sales role, you are made to feel as though you are only as good as your numbers - The metrics are INSANE. Everyone knows people are just BS'ing their way through bc the metrics are so unrealistic - Work-life balance is horrible if you're actually trying to do your job the legit way and its high stress all the time despite whatever is going on in the world - Snobby AEs that are selfish but no one cares if you're hitting your number",15 people found this review helpful
