Salesforce proved to be beyond my expectations. Being one of the most innovative companies in the world, there are so many moving parts that make this company great. There is always interesting stuff to fill your plate with.

53,A company that TRULY cares about their employees,,5.0,"Salesforce's culture has consistently exceeded my expectations time and time again. Salesforce truly acts in the best interest of their employees, instead of only focusing on shareholders. This has become even more apparent during the COVID-19 pandemic. Salesforce quickly and efficiently shifted to having all their employees work from home to protect their safety, began weekly company-wide calls with the executive leadership team so employees are always away of updates across the company during COVID, financially supported employees' home office setups, made numerous additions to the benefits plan to adjust to COVID-19, and continually prioritize employee wellbeing during all these changes. Salesforce talked a lot about ""Ohana"" or ""family"" in my interviews, I'm so happy to say that culture they talk about to candidates is genuinely the culture we all get to experience day-to-day.

There are some employees spending as much as 50% of their time on volunteer activity - literally logging more than a thousand hours of volunteer time a year. The support that the company offers its employees in times of need is exceptional, and the care and understanding of middle management is genuine. I care for all of my team members well being, and support them personally and professionally as much as possible. So do my colleagues.","Underneath the facade, Salesforce is focused on perception more than reality. VTO isn't volunteer time off at all. It's voluntold time on-top (of existing work load) for most of the company. We have targets for VTO set, but many business units aren't staffed appropriately to actually take the time off. Instead it's just adding work load on top of our existing work load. Also, the company really exemplifies the wealth gap, with those at the top heavily rewarded with expensive trips, awards (including cars, watches, etc.) while the majority of the company is paid somewhere around the 75th percentile of industry. We once had a travel freeze but the company still sent the top 100+ employees to a big shindig in Hawaii - and they broadcast it and insisted that everyone across the company ""tune in"" to it remotely.

150,Top Company in Software Sales,,5.0,"Salesforce was the first to pioneer Saas, and is the leader worldwide today. This is a fantastic platform to sell, that is known universally, and is adopted for a reason. The product works, and it works well. This is a product that any AE can be confident in, and for me being confident in what I sell drives my success. Further, Salesforce takes care of it's employees. I've been blown away by the pandemic response. Salesforce is not only a place that a strong AE can make a lot of money, it's a place you know where management stands. Salesforce management publicly came out and said there would be no lay-offs(there weren't), and pro-actively rolled out programs and incentives to take care of employees. Salesforce is a place you can grow your career, and you can constantly learn. With all of the acquisitions, you can switch to a new product that interests you, or pivot into leadership. I've worked a number of places in my career, and Salesforce is the best so far. There are absolutely downsides, which I get into below, but for me personally I plan to be here for the foreseeable future. Frankly, I believe in Salesforce's leadership team and strategy. We are making some incredible acquisitions and are positioned to be the undisputed cloud leader in ten years.","Politics. If you have only worked at small companies, big companies are a different beast. Salesforce, like any big company, has an element of politicking to it. At any company playing ""the game"" is important, so expect that here. Large quotas, and small patches. Salesforce has fine tuned territory management, and some ae's have stronger patches than others. It is important to succeed early and often so that you have the credibility to be assigned stronger accounts. New employees not willing to hustle and prove themselves do not last. This is how every big company is in my experience. If you don't have a ton of sales experience, make sure you start at a lower title with a larger territory. Big companies are harder to ""learn the ropes at"", as you are competing with the best of the best for things like territory. Other than the above, Salesforce has been the best move in my career, and I'm thrilled and proud to work here. I've never found a place without the above cons, and the pros far outweigh them for me.",2 people found this review helpful

COVID put all companies to the test and Salesforce reacted with their employees (and customers) first and still continues as the pandemic stretches on. I have been incredibly impressed at everything they have done and continue to do to make sure we still make money, keep our health and family life in mind, and over communicate so we know exactly what is happening inside and outside of the company. COVID aside, the people they hire are all really talented and a culture fit so you are working with incredibly smart people that want to help you succeed even if they don't benefit at all. I don't think I've run across one person yet that hasn't offered to help with anything I need now or in the future. The bar has been set incredibly high and I don't see myself making a move to another company anytime soon, even if I was offered more money.

166,Great place to work - with caveats,,4.0,"Salesforce is a great place to work, for a lot of people a lot of the time. My perspective is mostly from consulting services/CSG, but there are some things that apply across the board. -Excellent focus on work/life balance. Better than anywhere else I've found in terms of consulting or engineering jobs. -Excellent salary. My title maps to ""senior manager"" level as an individual contributor, and all things considered I am extremely satisfied with it. -Health insurance is excellent, in terms of coverage/cost/options. One of the better plans I've seen. -401(k) is excellent if you're an investing wonk. The match tops out at $5k which is middle-of-the-pack, and the plan is through Fidelity (meh) with which you get a good selection of funds, but more importantly, BrokerageLink to invest in the wider markets, and the ability to contribute after-tax beyond the 402(g) limit and auto-convert to Roth with 1 phone call to set this up. This is relatively new in the marketplace, and still rare. Tl;dr is you can contribute as much as $52,000 to your plan for 2020 and characterize as Roth in the end, not $19,500, regardless of your age (research ""Mega Backdoor Roth""), which is a huge benefit for financial planning for highly-compensated employees. -Working for Salesforce comes with a lot of cachet within the world of software vendors and partners, and access to awesome tools and information. If you've been a consultant or worked for an ISV and geek out to the product, you're going to love it here, and often be able to get involved with really interesting clients, projects, and internal initiatives shaping future product development.","I did say ""caveats"". -RSUs are low as compared to FAANG and there are no refreshers - hence, there are a lot of boomerangs, and a reputation as a ""retirement home"", because there is no reward for working harder if you are not also trying to get promoted. -Despite claiming to have a culture of open debate, it doesn't exist and there is seemingly no motivation to change this. For example, even though they say they will answer forum questions relating to the weekly allhands, they never do if it pertains to an internal policy. There is no upward feedback mechanism, except for your direct manager, and on many teams this is a ""player/coach"" who has no involvement in setting the policies of the department. There is an ""airing of grievances"" forum but it is heavily ""tone-policed"". Bottom line is that if you get stuck in a bad situation or team, your options are to change teams or leave, there is no opportunity to improve things from within. -Silos and a lack of coordination result in many internally competitive and duplicative efforts, and inefficiencies. Product-wise there is crossover between Marketing Cloud and Pardot, Tableau and Einstein; and Vlocity/CPQ/B2B Commerce for example. Whatever's new and shiny (acquisitions and Dreamforce announcements) gets love, but if your area is not, good luck getting Trailhead modules or product management to prioritize new feature development. There are approximately 90 billion different efforts to create documentation for consulting resources for how to do their job, all run by different groups and stored on different platforms. And because Slack and Microsoft are viewed as competitors, there is no company-wide collaboration tool like Slack or Teams, it's just a bunch of incomplete tools like Google Chat and Salesforce Chatter and Quip and email and.... -There tends to be a lot of politics between teams, even beyond the product-related competitive/redundancy issues. In short, if you like what you're doing, and who you're doing it for/with, you're in a great position. But if you don't, you're going to have a bad time. I don't know anyone who was unhappy with their situation in Salesforce who subsequently made it better, at least without changing teams.",7 people found this review helpful
