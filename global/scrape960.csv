Everyone says it... except for management. In 2019, only two AE's hit their number. Everyone else told and I quote ""either not up to it or not working hard enough"". The third alternative being the model isn't set up right and they have over hired AE's, but leadership tone deaf to that alternative. - Not a place to earn money as an AE unless you get one of the performing territories - There is no in country marketing resources leaning on reps to run events and drive awareness - Product over priced and NZ leadership team not armed with the ammunition to compete against Hubspot who were doing ""COVID"" deals and giving 90% off in first year - Career progression limited - Brain washing is real - New rep measures are always being introduced and feels like big brother is always watching - no consistency and the line is always moving/complicated.

Senior leaders are there to protect themselves and have stopped focusing on helping the company or it’s customers as a whole. Senior leaders to often dictate the way something should be with very little interest in others views. Sadly departments have been siloed and are often forced to compete with each other instead of collaborating together. No matter what is said, Salesforce does very poorly when it comes to supporting remote offices. If you aren’t working at one of their major hubs on the West coast of the US, then expect very little support or compassion when it comes to working in a remote office, or a non-HQ timezone.",6 people found this review helpful

I have been joining the weekly call for some time and felt that he could not earn the respect from his own team member. Failed to retain talents and deliver number for 2 consecutive quarters. So far none of his inputs had been making sense to me. - 2nd hand observation: He creates toxic environments to the team and practice poor communication skills to the team with dictatorial leadership style, leaving most team member frustrated and demotivated. He would put his subordinates on the spot during team meeting and would say unnecessary comments questions during 1:1. Company need to be more transparent in terms of the approach for the country model strategy because it puts us on so much uncertainties.",15 people found this review helpful

153,"5 stars company and opportunity for the ones ready to go the extra mile, everyday.",,5.0,"Excellent colleagues and extended team with brilliant people among the organization that will continuously teach you one or two things you didn't know. Full freedom, ownership, and responsibility of your deals and clients. You have the last word regarding stuff related to the sales process and your voice will also be listened and respected in any other area or topic. Amazing structure and processes. Everything is thought and in continuous progress so there is always something or someone ready to give you answers or help you out. Huge incentive package with repetitive SPIFFs and bonuses that can rocket jump your final compensation and motivation. If you mix it with all the benefits and perks Salesforce provides, you can really simply focus on working. Feeling of family, understanding, and respect since day one. Values of Ohanna and Equality are not just a commercial label but something that's put in practice every day. ""Limitless"" career progression. New positions, clouds, acquisitions, and markets are coming up in a really fast pace manner so you can visualize your future next step within the company in a very early stage.","Information overload. Having an already impressive world of solutions, with new updates, apps, integrations, or products coming up every month, is almost impossible to stay on track about all you should know. The resources are limitless and helpful but you can get lost in a huge ocean of data that can lead to a little bit of desperation. Easy to fall in an only work mindset life, and it will be your fault, not the company's. Moving into Dublin (not the most exciting and cheap city in the world) for a job will already tell enough about you. This is a demanding job with a lot of freedom and perks from the company (the company and the management are the number 1 rest, holiday and work/life balance importance praisers) but if you want to do a good job and perform as you are coming here to, expect to work very long hours and days, especially in the beginning. Don't expect to be a free bird as you used to be, probably never. Targets are ambitious and so is your compensation and benefits, so expect to be tied tight and monitored on a very regular basis. With the working from home, it has been more accentuated that some might confuse it with micromanagement. Never is enough. Like any other sales company in the world, no matter how much you sell or work, you can always be asked to do little more. Take ownership of your pipeline and expect not to get the foot out of the gas pedal until the holidays break, no matter at which number you at. The party is almost over. If you are coming from an startup, you should see Salesforce as that older brother that used to be in all of the parties getting into its mid 30's. He knows what the fun is about but is now switching into a more responsible lifestyle and will only join those parties once a month let's say.",5 people found this review helpful

175,Obsolete Management and Working Style.,"Sep 4, 2020 - Senior Associate in Tokyo",1.0,"Benefits such as wellness allowance, great office location (centre of Tokyo).","JP office is extremely domestic, and does not have the drive, momentum or speed which other international tech firms or a typical foreign sub company has as a working culture. Since the majority of the people in the back office has been working here for a very long time (which is a good thing in one way), many of them are not use to changes - rather prefer to stick to the norm. Ohana is one of the key culture (which is a great conceptually) in Salesforce. But in JP back office, this is recognized in a different/miss leading manner. More specifically, it's been recognized as ""protection"", rather than supporting and challenging each other for growth. This shows up as lack of ownership, professionalism and extremely conservative working style/attitude. If you try to challenge someone, you're taken in a different way. Since there's really no culture of challenging each other, it's taken very offensively --- that's still fine but the most shocking part is, senior management doesn't notice or understand anymore of the benefits of growth via challenges and constructive communication. This is one of the most disappointing aspects of this office where it doesn't show to the outer world --- I have seen another review saying ""a master of disguise"" and completely understand what it means. When joining, do not expect a high paced, competitive working style lead by professionals with strong ownership --- but rather expect a conservative environment, hence for those who are looking for growth via challenges, constructive communication and data driven decision makings, this may not be the best place for you. Money is good, but growth wise, not able to recommend.",5 people found this review helpful
