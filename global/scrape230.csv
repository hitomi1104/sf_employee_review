8,Salesforce truly supports and values family priorities,"Apr 27, 2021 - Senior Security Engineer in Seattle, WA",5.0,"Salesforce has posted the benefits its offers employees online so I will not cover those here.

Over and over again I have been able to flex my schedule to meet family obligations. The on-going pandemic has really brought to the fore front the huge advantage of SalesForce as a company that actually support employees. Recently I needed to drop a project to be with a sick parent.

What's worse is that it appears that the HR folks are either powerless and so they go along or they are in on it. Several coworkers described experiences of being horribly berated by hatchet folks in HR based on ""complaints"" that HR would not clarify or explain. They described being pulled onto phone calls and told they have to ""apologize for what you did"", and when asked what they were talking about, would be told ""it's impossible that you don't know what we're talking about and if you don't then it's even worse than we thought."" Some have hypothesized this is how Salesforce rattles employees they, for whatever reason, decide they want to leave ( inside scoop indicates this is another maneuver by some VPs to create ""opportunities"" to shape an org the way they want when they get key folks to self-select out) but have no reason to push them out or worse yet, the employees were actually considered high performing by prior managers. I highly recommend anyone considering Salesforce to stay away unless it is the best you can get because its a huge company, if you get on the wrong side of just about anyone it could get really bad for you and there is nothing you can do.",24 people found this review helpful

We sit in employee town halls discussing flex time and working from home, but the leadership in this department wants to micro manage their teams and press their thumbs down on everyone.

So if you are not comfortable advocating for yourself and sometimes shouting your wins from the rooftop you may not want to work here. This is very true in Marketing, perhaps not all other BUs. - While diversity is a core a value, Salesforce like most tech companies are not as diverse as they think, so something to keep in mind if you're a minority.
