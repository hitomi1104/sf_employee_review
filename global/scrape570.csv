1,A very exciting company for which to work.,,5.0,"Salary, benefits, perks all top notch. Every opportunity for growth that I could imagine is given. Our leadership really cares; it's not just a tagline at Salesforce, and I mean 'cares' in the broadest sense of the word. Marc's leadership on organizing against the various discriminatory legislation in the US is a great external example. Know that this extends to our internal structure as well and is the bedrock of our corporate culture. I'm gushing, I know, but it's truly how I feel.",Know that there is a high pace to the work at Salesforce. We work in an area of the industry with tremendous growth and continued growth potential. Some people may not fit well in such an environment.,1 person found this review helpful
2,Account Executive,,4.0,Fast growing company that invests in its products while focusing on customer success. Fast pace keeps you focused on driving towards company initiatives.,The pace isn't for everyone. The shiny lights turn to spotlights once you're carrying quota. There is a revolving door for those that can't hit their numbers or cannot adapt to the environment. Put your best foot forward!,2 people found this review helpful
3,Incredible culture.,,5.0,The company values their customers and employees. The solutions are innovative and the company culture is addictive. You're encouraged to grow and be better every day.,Intense at times. If you don't know how to manage your time then you could get stressed out. If you're not good working as a team then you won't survive.,4 people found this review helpful
4,Senior Technical Program Manager,,4.0,"So far, the company appears to walk the walk around topics of culture and diversity. 7 days of time off to volunteer! Exceptional snacks. Top notch planned/managed on boarding plan that involves periodic automated emails paced to when you need the information. The company lives and dies using its own product as the backbone of collaboration ... and it works very well! Appears to be very supportive of both windows and mac environments and has a top notch IT environment. Has a strong internal culture of supporting people that consider changing jobs.",Current shake up in relocating the Seattle office.,Be the first to find this review helpful

10,Knockin on the Boy's Clubhouse Door,,2.0,Marc Benioff is an envisionary leader. The innovation that he inspires as well as his passion to build a company that embraces equality and diversity makes for a compelling set of reasons to be part of this great company.,"While the west coast may be working on meeting Marc's lofty goals, the midwest(specifically midwest CSG) is swiftly becoming the white male centric world. Women are not staying within various roles within CSG in growing numbers and it's becoming very obvious that this is a white man's world. If you read the Chicago Tribune this weekend, you will not that more and more diversity factors(black, Hispanic, etc) are leaving for more favorable areas from every company, not just SF. If anyone would do the data analysis for CSG Chicago, warning bells should go off. The executive leadership is slowly but surely driving women out of their workforce vs embracing Marc's culture.",17 people found this review helpful

36,Sales Strategy and Operations,,3.0,- Great place to learn about sales/go-to-market strategy by watching others - Salesforce emphasizes sales and growth across the company which makes this position (as one tightly aligned with the sales team) one with significant view across functions - Strong company brand name - Great company-wide culture of giving through Salesforce Foundation and CEO's lead - Good average quality of coworkers on team,"- Compensation is low relative to peer companies - Days can be long (11-12 hrs minimum) and, after ~1 year, provide diminishing marginal return from the same role (result of 11-12+ hours of the same thing every day) - Team is hierarchical, having lost any ""startup"" feel it had as a result of significant growth. Result is a more political environments - Career trajectory within company is undefined and getting narrower as team's growth slows and more management levels are introduced. Promotion periods have also been extended, with fewer opportunities for ""moving up"" as a result - Rapidly diminishing exposure to senior management - more of a ""performance reporting and presentation creation"" role for the managers on the team",7 people found this review helpful

The benefits are excellent, ranging from your fairly typical health insurance and stock options to free catered meals, train passes, and a sizeable monthly housing stipend for living within 3 miles of the main office in Palo Alto. On top of that, the company listens to it's employees and acquires things people want. For example, recent acquisitions included a foosball table and a new cold brew kegerator.","Honestly the only downside I've been able to come up with is that they don't allow dogs.

The feeling in the group is contempt for Salesforce and the people committed to Salesforce. People work in fear, which is not the culture it was before they joined.

Highly recommend joining the Salesforce team,"Jul 25, 2015 - Anonymous Employee in San Francisco, CA",5.0,"-Huge emphasis on the importance of charitable giving and being environmentally sustainable (backed by 6 paid volunteer days per employee annually, $5000 annual employee match for charitable giving, frequent internal charitable events) -Prioritizes engaging employees by aligning personal career goals with each employee's duties and encouraging movement between functions and departments throughout the company -Incredibly intelligent workforce: Salesforce is able to use its strong brandname to hire only the top talent and as a result has an environment where you are constantly challenged and learning, which continuously develops your own skill set. (Less than 1% of applicants receive employment offers) -Strong community environment: Salesforce has been able to build a corporate family unlike any company I've been a part of before. People honestly care for each other and will go out of their way to look out for past and present employees. Salesforce focuses on working as a team rather than separate individuals which develops a sense of inclusion. -Incredible parties: Salesforce certainly caters to a more extroverted, lively and connected personality by having frequent social and networking events throughout the year -$100/mth employee fitness benefit and health benefits that are largely absorbed by the company. Free yoga classes and espresso bars are also offered in some offices -Offices are generally situated in the heart of cities rather than in suburbs",-Headcount growing perhaps too quickly which could transform the community feel to a more corporate environment -Does not offer full meals (light snacks and beverages are provided) -Signals of a more corporate future ahead evidenced by a shift away from local vendors to their global competitors,62 people found this review helpful

122,"Best company I've ever worked for, with one huge flaw",,3.0,"It's great to work for the 800 pound gorilla. Does YOUR company have Stevie Wonder as the opening act of your CEO's keynote speech? Hmm? Everything about the company is world class. The benefits, the opportunities, the projects, the technology, and even the compensation for most roles. Some of the sales reps get a raw deal with territories, but if you're one of the lucky ones, you can really do well. Salesforce continues to lead the pack in innovative social policies. They were one of the first major companies to initiate a comprehensive review of female compensation, which is very much appreciated. Some women at the company received substantial raises, which one one hand is great, but on the other hand raises some uncomfortable questions.","This is a tough one, because I love this company in so many ways. I'm not a bitter ex-employee; on the contrary, I'm extremely happy here and I want to have a long career with Salesforce. That's what breaks my heart about how little commitment to diversity the company has. To illustrate the point, I am black, and I cannot reveal my gender and office location, because doing so would reveal my identity. That's how few black employees we have at the company. Now, it's easy to fall back on the usual tech industry explanation of there being a ""pipeline issue"" that ties to minority education in STEM. There's absolutely truth to that, as you can't recruit what's not there. But here's the thing: when you fill your ranks with the same type of people in order to maintain some sort of ""company culture"", you create an environment in which the employees don't have enough exposure to people not like them to think of them as co-workers. The proof? If even your fictional website, PowerPoint and product demo characters are all white, there's a deeper problem than a simple ""pipeline issue"". It means non-white people are not part of your worldview. The implications of that are dire.",3 people found this review helpful

Many times creating unnecessary scares causing folks to prematurely jump ship - most boomerang back but k feel if we could get in front of this, we could reduce the boomerang rate. Additionally, RSU and overall stock grants to a limited number of employees. At my former employer, I was given RSUs off the bat but not here at SFDC and I've been here almost 5 years and in a fairly senior role. Not sure why that's the case.

Now, with the infiltration of Salesforce (which, don't get me wrong, Salesforce is great in its own way, but that greatness has not manifested in Indianapolis - it's been mostly destructive), the Marketing Cloud leadership team is much more concerned with making people like Marc Benioff and Alex Dayyon happy rather than creating a culture of happy employees. In a recent ""V2MOM"" session, leadership blatantly voted ""employee success"" as the LEAST important value among 6-7 value options. Don't you get it? Happy and successful employees lead to good product, good service, and thriving business!! As I look around, I see a bunch of people sitting there just doing bare minimum to collect a paycheck, others frantically trying to cling to the last bit of Orange culture they can find, and a select few who thrive in this new environment of ""nothing matters but the bottom line"".

261,"Awesome internship program, but growth is a little bit crazy",,5.0,"Intern housing downtown San Francisco & Indy Snacks, beer at work Frequent happy hours Fun team outings Fantastic company culture- very engaged with local community","The company is reaching the point where it could really be considered a large company, rather than a medium one. As such, there are definitely some growing pains. Getting things like tickets resolved can take a long period of time, and there does seem to be some bloat. It's still a fantastic place to work, but does need to reevaluate as it grows.",1 person found this review helpful

263,Doing it the right way,,5.0,"I know not all middle managers at Salesforce are like this, but my manager really puts his employees first. There's a lot of trust in employees to do the right thing, which means greater trust for things like work-life balance, work from home, etc. The top leaders really do care about the things they talk about as well which is great.",I can't say there's much at this point.,Be the first to find this review helpful

265,Try to get a job with Salesforce - you will not regret,,5.0,"One company that makes you feel part of their success and make you feel that you are valuable to the company. I have worked in other large organizations and that bit was missing. There is a ton of opportunities you can explore and they make you have everything to be successful. Extremely helpful and seamless onboarding. You have to deliver though, but if you are taken care of, then I dont think that should be an issue for anyone.","It takes a bit of time to really understand what they are doing, but not really a negative but sometimes could be overwhelming for a new comer ..so just have patience and you will do well.",2 people found this review helpful

269,Outstanding Place to Work,,5.0,"I have worked at several of the major software firms in the Seattle area in my career. Salesforce by far has the greatest culture. There is a lot of energy and passion you can feel in the air. The company treats people right. There is no emphasis on constant evaluation like you see at companies like Microsoft and Amazon. The result is that the employees are self-motivated to be productive and innovative and collaborative. Benefits are excellent, including receiving pay for volunteer work you do for nonprofits. They match donations you make, even those to your local church or synagogue.","- The CEO and company are very outspoken in support of progressive causes. If you are politically a right-wing conservative, you may feel uncomfortable.",1 person found this review helpful

Snacks on every floor is a nice perk. The volunteer time off program is a great way to spend a lot of time giving back. The PTO policy offers quite a bit of time off for the first year. The people in the office are very nice and helpful. The workplace is very fun and exciting. It is a fast paced environment where everything changes.","The training program for many positions is limited, which creates a more on-the-job-learning environment. This is fine for some, but others may have issues if they are learning something brand new. Also, I would like to learn more about the products even if you are in a service role versus a sales role.",Be the first to find this review helpful

282,"Great company, benefits, flexibility","Sep 29, 2015 - Senior DevOps Engineer in San Francisco, CA",4.0,"The benefits and flexibility of working for salesforce can't be beat. It's an enormous organization, and I work for a smaller subsidiary, so your team and work experience will vary based largely on to whom you report, as always. The leadership, and Mark benioff in particular, take vocal political stances against anti-LGBT and other discriminatory legislation, which is practically unheard of in the corporate world, but is tremendously valuable to society when a software giant like salesforce takes the lead","cons will always depend on your group, team and manager",2 people found this review helpful

284,AE,"Sep 11, 2015 - Account Executive in New York, NY",3.0,Great great technology and product to sell. The development team here are off the charts good. The Sales Engineers are world class. I love Marc's mission cry and every time I hear Patrick or Keith speak I'm in a fit of joy to go out and help new customers. High octane and high IQ environment. Some greats here for sure.,"The leadership here needs to provide management training to VPs. While the training AE's get is 2nd to none, the direct management and coaching falls extremely short. For example, 6 months in, I have yet to have any kind of a review or coaching. There's also a common thread of jaded sales reps here. For example, ""I took x account almost to the finish line, the fiscal year ended, and someone else got credit for the deal."" This is a systemic problem because I have noticed those reps no longer enter information into Salesforce..what's the point if you'll lose the client next year. Team building - really another surprising gap here. I'm sure San Francisco HQ doesn't have this problem. Too new to be offended but the above is real. We get the ""best company to work for"" but really its the ""best product to sell."" Which isn't bad but not great.",9 people found this review helpful
