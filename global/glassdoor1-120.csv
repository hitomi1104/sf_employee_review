I came in as an outside hire for the first 4 months in the role my Account Executives had no time for me to learn about their accounts, what their goals were and wouldn't let me into their key accounts to help set meetings. This affects my KPI's and was expected to perform with little to no direction. It's radio silent in my 1:1s and was asked to come up with points of view into their new logo accounts. They don't utilize their BDRs correctly and believe were supposed to research all of their new logo accounts and come in with a step by step plan. How am I supposed to do this with no knowledge or direction on any of the products or goals? I've been told by other reps that you have to internally sell you AE's on why things should be opportunities.

55,Too big for it's britches,,2.0,"You learn a TON, and are exposed to some really incredible people here. I wouldn't change my time here at all and have met some of the best mentors and smartest people in the industry. Benefits are great, WFH flexibility and the stipends are wonderful. There is a lot of opportunity to move around within the company and learn new roles and duties, which is lucky, because in order to move up you will have to move around.","The promotion system is broken. Period. Only promoting 1-3% of your workforce every 6 months is a broken process and gives over-perfoming employees two options if they don't get promoted that round - wait and see, or move into a new role within the company at the higher title. Or, the route I took, leave the company. I understand putting a cap on the amount of promotions each team can have, but it can cause teammates to have to wait YEARS for a promotion they should have just been given. And finally, ""Ohana"" is BS in my opinion when it comes to those in leadership. Those not in leadership totally embody that spirit, but the amount of politics, backstabbing and egotistical leaders in this company is unacceptable. When you disagree with someone who doesn't understand your job but is in a leadership role, you are punished, get duties you enjoy doing taken away from you, and told to make things better without any guidance on what is actually broken. Salary is also way under in comparison to other companies. Salesforce used to be at the top of salary ranges, and have unfortunately not kept up with the times. Every year the employee survey continually highlights these issues, and now with some of the top employees in the company moving on to greener pastures, I really hope they tackle these problems. It starts from the top.",4 people found this review helpful

If you do not suck up to middle management, you will not grow at Salesforce - Seniors dating and marrying their direct reports (which explains the favoritism above) - There is no feedback loop for employees to provide their feedback to upper management.

103,A GREAT Opportunity,"Apr 25, 2022 - Account Executive in Irvine, CA",5.0,"Joined the company about 6 months ago thinking I understood selling, and how to close business having spent 13 years in various AM & BD roles, but Salesforce takes the art of selling to another level entirely, and gives you the at-bats and the opportunity to succeed at every turn. They truly poured millions into learning and development, with more resources and training you could ask for or find anywhere else. Everyone makes you feel welcomed from the get-go, and there is a true mentality of ""we are in the trenches together"", where everyone is more than willing to help the new folks at the drop of a hat, because they've been there, and they care about their colleagues. It really is impressive. The compensation is lucrative, and the spiffs are insane! The office environment is very casual, and fun. Management, at least my chain of command, are in your corner and helping you whenever they can, and they do not pull punches (which I love), so you always know where you stand with them. They're tough, and so is the job, but more than fair, and highly rewarding.","I am not going to sugar coat it, onboarding and finding your sea legs once you have your territory, in a remote environment is REALLY TOUGH. You will feel lost at times, and wonder how you are going to hit any quota. There are so many resources available for anything you are trying to do that it can seem overwhelming; the phrase everyone repeats when you start is ""its like drinking from a firehose"", which I brushed off initially, because what job worth doing is easy to get started in? but they mean it, and you should believe it. SOOO much info is pumped into your brain when you start, it seems nearly impossible to grasp everything. The comp plan is wildly complicated, so you really have to take the time to understand how you make money so you can focus your efforts appropriately.",3 people found this review helpful

147,"Amazing experience, fantastic company",,5.0,"Salesforce has a really solid business model, with a subscription-based approach to software that was revolutionary when it was first introduced 23 years ago. This subscription-based approach means that ongoing revenue can be relied on, for all customers that remain with the company. Since the attrition, or the loss of customers, is very low, this means that the cash flow for this business is very reliable and predictable over the long term. The company really strives to gain the trust and to ensure that customers are successful. These happy customers then become highly referenceable, and recommend our solution for others. Our product has become such a vital part of their business that it is also very sticky over the long term. As our company continues to acquire new capabilities, our solution becomes even more enticing and relevant, since we can address and integrate a broad cross-section of the needs of each of our customers (Marketing, Sales, Commerce, Service, Analytics). We deliver a comprehensive enterprise software solution, which is cohesive and integrated in ways that no other company can provide. In addition to this, we constantly think of ways to innovate and make our customers lives easier. We are able to digitize and improve the efficiency of a broad cross-section of enterprises out there who do not focus on digital solutions as their core business. All of these factors together represent a very strong opportunity for continued growth of this business. Salesforce has also been executing really well on surmounting many of the more difficult technical challenges that they faced due to the fact that the product is based on legacy code. There is technical debt related to the database, also there is a major migration underway to move to the public cloud. The company has executed incredibly well on these and many other challenges internally. The culture is incomparable. The leadership of the company have a genuine concern for each employee, and a real investment in doing the right thing for the community. The company takes a leading role in helping to champion initiatives that address homelessness and environmental issues for example. We also are really committed to the success of all of our stakeholders, including employees, customers, partners, communities, and all of the trailblazers who form the broader salesforce community. The ecosystem of administrators, architects and developers who are part of our space has continued to grow, and the company is also really proactive in helping to develop the skills of those people that might be interested in growing a career with our products.","There are not many downsides. The culture is really open and accepting. They are very accommodating to the needs of their employees, and they earn a significant degree of loyalty in return. Because this is such a great company, many people are willing to go the extra mile to keep this good thing going. There may be some mild challenges in terms of managing the culture internally, and ensuring that every group feels included, and part of the Salesforce family. Still, our leader ship clearly spends a lot of time focusing on the correct approach here, and ensuring that there are enough opportunities for people to connect with like minded coworkers, and to ensure that they are recognized and appreciated.",Be the first to find this review helpful

Remote work. Just get your stuff done on time.,"- Need to build relationships to have certain work opportunities. If your a ""I like user stories"" kind of person, this will become a problem after 1 year. On the upside you get to pick what assists you work on.

322,The hype is real!,,5.0,"- Innovative company and culture that is striving to be best-in-class when it comes to driving social impact, emphasizing diversity and inclusion, giving back to the community, sponsoring employee wellness and development, and carrying out sustainability initiatives. Salesforce lives and leads with its values from the top down and encourages transparency and feedback throughout the organization. - For a large enterprise, Salesforce works hard to ensure we are agile and nimble. The company is not afraid to fail fast, pivot strategies, execute on new ideas and proactively lead with a bold vision in the face of a rapidly changing world. The phrase ""Better, better, never best"" is a great way to describe the culture. - Individually in my customer-facing sales role, I enjoy being able to work with so many different types of businesses and executives. It's rewarding to help clients succeed, transform, and adapt their businesses - and it's also a fantastic learning experience for my own development. Because Salesforce has such a huge platform, we are enabled to have conversations with every business department and are empowered to deliver real value. While we are selling a technical product, working at Salesforce allows me to elevate the conversation by leaning on Salesforce's own internal success and leadership to inspire my customers. - There is a sense of pride in working here; there are just so many cool things about this company, it's hard to list them all!","- The job itself is not ""easy."" Because the company is always innovating, always bringing new products and solutions to market, and always striving to stay at the forefront of the most pressing business challenges and trends facing our customers, there's constantly new information we need to learn in order to be trusted advisors to the clients we support. It's a lot to learn and stay enabled on; this is a company that thrives on fast-paced change. - Additionally, because our platform literally does everything, there are a variety of ""point solution"" competitors big and small that we have to constantly stay one step ahead of. Fortunately, Salesforce invests in product specialists, competitive intelligence teams, and other resources to support you. - You can definitely make a lot of money here if you are a top performer. That said, I get the sense that our base salaries are less competitive than comparable software sales roles at other high tech companies. That's a tradeoff to working at the best company though. Once you work here, you can get hired wherever. In fact, many people leave the company in order to get a MUCH more senior role somewhere else, and then leverage that to come back to Salesforce at much higher role and salary band. Staying at Salesforce might mean that your upward mobility is slower.",4 people found this review helpful

It's one that takes care of its people, and gives back to the community. Benefits are generous, including 5 volunteer days included in PTO. When the pandemic hit, Salesforce made sure that its employees were well-outfitted to work from home, and emphasized prioritizing mental health and balancing new work/life struggles. (Note that it wasn't all rosy, Salesforce also chose to do a round of layoffs during the pandemic, even though they were experiencing a record quarter, which caused a lot of controversy.) For as large of a company as Salesforce is, it is reasonably transparent. Employees have access to executive leadership, and have opportunities to ask them tough questions, such as regarding the layoffs they chose to do during the pandemic.","There is a lot of pride in Salesforce's culture, which can often feel a bit cult-like. I joined Salesforce through an acquisition, and the leaders at the acquired company seemed much more used to tough questions than leaders that I observed at Salesforce.

The resource groups create an environment of belonging and offers many models to follow to create a work/life balance. This is extremely valuable for someone newer in their position.,"There are so many things to do! It can be a bit overwhelming if your time management skills are efficient.

528,"Lowest paid ORG, zero advocacy, little opportunity to move up",,1.0,"Salesforce's leadership is very smart, the company is growing quickly, health insurance is great, benefits are outstanding, snacks/food are a plus.","I believe that the REWS leadership is very much lacking. We are forced to baby REWS leadership like royalty to ""show off our hospitality skills"" but don't give the same treatment to even our most exclusive customers. I'm talking Starbucks three times a day with multiple drink options, extravagant catering setups with ridiculous dietary restrictions/preferences, gifts in the hundreds and hundreds of dollars for each exec for each visit, flowers and local fare being supplied in their hotel rooms, etc. These folks live like rockstars on the road. When COVID first started, we had front desk personnel crying because they were forced to stay at the desk. This same org was the first forced to come back into the office. Guidelines were set that everyone were to come back, no exceptions. Yet, we were finding out that exceptions were being made in other offices (unfair). The REWS leadership outwardly encourages employees to look for jobs outside of the org because, although they won't say it, there is no opportunity within it. When promotions or openings upward come available, they are given to those outside the company. The REWS team is the lowest paid org in the company and is treated like a cog in the machine. Very few people feel empowered to advocate for themselves or their teams. I can't remember the last time my team had a team-building, let alone a team-wide meeting. Managers only care about making sure they are seen in a good light for execs.",4 people found this review helpful

One of the most challenging things with any new job is getting ramped up to perform to the best of your abilities. Salesforce has blown away any preconceived notions I had of what an onboarding experience should be like. From providing me a coach during the interview process to that I am presenting the best version of myself and my skill set to an thoughtfully laid out onboard plan. I do understand that I may have a different experience than others because each department also controls a large portion of onboarding. However, I don't know of another company that spends 3-6 months ramping you in all the relevant areas you need to be successful at your job. Afterall, my success is ultimately the company's success. Additionally, I was paired with both a mentor who had been in the job for some time (12+ months) and a buddy who was only a few months ahead of me and can still remember all the struggles and challenges.","In regards to the onboarding experience, I have absolutely none.

I only met a few people who actually knew what the Salesforce platform was, how it was used for different verticals and what the benefits were for customers. Trying to to use the product internally was a comedy of errors. No one understands how it works or how to use it. Too many siloes, even the siloes have siloes. 1200 tiles on okta, are you kidding? Lots of politics and backstabbing. Many problems caused or perpetuated by the very people who say they are trying to fix it. Leadership was more cliquey than high school.

561,A great place to work that burns out employees,,3.0,"Every position at Salesforce will be a different experience, who you work for matters a lot, and what you sell will impact your experience. That being said, if you're in Sales at Salesforce, you are fuelling the rocketship growth and that isn't always the most enjoyable experience. Let's start with the good: Great benefits, mostly great products, the pay is competitive (although reps are leaving for better pay more frequently), there is plenty of company culture kool-aid, and you can make pretty good commissions if you hit accelerators with the right accounts. Salesforce looks good on a resume, and if you don't like where you land at first, there is plenty of lateral flexibility within the company.","The not-so-great: Salesforce is focused on growth and that means squeezing every penny out of its customers. To do this, they put a lot of sales reps into small territories. Sales reps are tasked with selling with big quotas and small territories. On the aggregate, Salesforce does well but individually it is becoming more and more difficult to hit quota. Less than 30% of Account Executives (AEs) actually hit their number if that tells you anything. Further, the resources around AEs internally are becoming more of an obstacle than a benefit. The hardest part of this job is getting others internally to do their jobs. If you raise your concerns, someone will hear you and then nothing will get done. You will just be making excuses. There are a lot of great sales professionals at Salesforce. However, with smaller territories, the good AEs are leaving. The newbies who are still learning are the ones trying to sell to customers. Customers complain about the constant churn of account teams. One of the top complaints is employee burnout and nothing seems to be done about it.",7 people found this review helpful

I am given the opportunity to as they say ""level up"" with very detailed one on ones. This model only works for those who want to be better engineers and customer service agents. I never feel as if my caseload is too much. in fact, I have the free time to help my team reach resolutions and educate myself on my product. I really hope to retire here Before this, I owned my own business, and before that, I was a contract IT.

583,"Amazing experience, fantastic company","Jun 6, 2022 - Lead Member of Technical Staff in San Francisco, CA",5.0,"Salesforce has a really solid business model, with a subscription-based approach to software that was revolutionary when it was first introduced 23 years ago. This subscription-based approach means that ongoing revenue can be relied on, for all customers that remain with the company. Since the attrition, or the loss of customers, is very low, this means that the cash flow for this business is very reliable and predictable over the long term. The company really strives to gain the trust and to ensure that customers are successful. These happy customers then become highly referenceable, and recommend our solution for others. Our product has become such a vital part of their business that it is also very sticky over the long term. As our company continues to acquire new capabilities, our solution becomes even more enticing and relevant, since we can address and integrate a broad cross-section of the needs of each of our customers (Marketing, Sales, Commerce, Service, Analytics). We deliver a comprehensive enterprise software solution, which is cohesive and integrated in ways that no other company can provide. In addition to this, we constantly think of ways to innovate and make our customers lives easier. We are able to digitize and improve the efficiency of a broad cross-section of enterprises out there who do not focus on digital solutions as their core business. All of these factors together represent a very strong opportunity for continued growth of this business. Salesforce has also been executing really well on surmounting many of the more difficult technical challenges that they faced due to the fact that the product is based on legacy code. There is technical debt related to the database, also there is a major migration underway to move to the public cloud. The company has executed incredibly well on these and many other challenges internally. The culture is incomparable. The leadership of the company have a genuine concern for each employee, and a real investment in doing the right thing for the community. The company takes a leading role in helping to champion initiatives that address homelessness and environmental issues for example. We also are really committed to the success of all of our stakeholders, including employees, customers, partners, communities, and all of the trailblazers who form the broader salesforce community. The ecosystem of administrators, architects and developers who are part of our space has continued to grow, and the company is also really proactive in helping to develop the skills of those people that might be interested in growing a career with our products.","There are not many downsides. The culture is really open and accepting. They are very accommodating to the needs of their employees, and they earn a significant degree of loyalty in return. Because this is such a great company, many people are willing to go the extra mile to keep this good thing going. There may be some mild challenges in terms of managing the culture internally, and ensuring that every group feels included, and part of the Salesforce family. Still, our leader ship clearly spends a lot of time focusing on the correct approach here, and ensuring that there are enough opportunities for people to connect with like minded coworkers, and to ensure that they are recognized and appreciated.",Be the first to find this review helpful

664,Toxic Sales Culture,,3.0,"Salesforce is an incredibly reputable company to work for. It really is the best resume booster you could ask for that sets you up to be recruited by almost every company. The benefits are top notch- healthcare, ESPP, wellness stipend, and discounts at a variety of different companies. The offices are absolutely beautiful and an impressive place to take friends and family. I have heard that most departments are really great to work for, but be VERY careful to do your due diligence in figuring out which ones those are.","Underneath its grandiose, towering presence and pristine public reputation, lies a dark reality in the sales organization. I could never recommend a career in sales at Salesforce for these reasons: Compensation: Salesforce's base and OTE's are well under the market rate for Account Executives. On top of that, you are punished financially for being promoted within the company, and will receive a base/OTE that is 10-20k lower than external hires. Due to this, there is incredibly high turnover, as long term Salesforce sales employees bounce to other companies to receive proper compensation and many of the sales teams are constantly dominated by new hires. Territories are created in a way in which only about 20% of reps will hit their annual number so base your expected income on your base rate and how comfortable you would be living off of that number. Customer treatment: Salesforce redistributes territories every fiscal year, meaning customers are given a new Account Executive every year. This leads to extreme frustration and oftentimes, customers being sold solutions that they don't necessarily need. Expect to be dealing with many angry customers during the first part of the fiscal year, and cleaning up the mess created by the previous AE. Management: From my experience, I have had some of the most micromanaging and condescending bosses of my career at Salesforce. Even though I am a remote employee, I constantly feel as if my boss is looking over my shoulder through the constant Slack messages and tracking of my daily activity (call/email volume). The worst part is the culture of toxic positivity. Never admit that you are struggling either with work or in your personal life, as that will be used against you in one way or another. Favoritism is rampant and is gifted to those who go out of their way to express immense gratitude, compliment their boss, and NEVER admit frustrations, even if valid. Sorry, but I'm too old to act like a corporate robot monkey. Career mobility: As I mentioned above, in the sales organization, your pay will hardly change as you go up-market. Switching into other departments is nearly impossible as you must seek VP level approvals, navigate the lousy internal recruiting teams, and build up a case as to why you are more valuable than external hires. This is why there are so many Salesforce boomerangs... Ultimately, I had really high hopes for the Sales Organization at Salesforce, but was super disappointed by my experience. I understand that not every experience will be the same, but I think it is important to look past the facade.",10 people found this review helpful

You're encouraged to explore different roles at the company, but it'll hold you back from pay increases and promotions even if you perform well and have great feedback from customers and leadership. The company is hyper political internally. Getting ahead is rarely about what you've done, but more who you're friends with. Leaders rarely listen to feedback even though they solicit it constantly and people of color are treated differently than white people. This company sells itself as a dream job, but really it's just like every other corporation: greedy, opaque, and insincere.",2 people found this review helpful

What's worse is that it appears that the HR folks are either powerless and so they go along or they are in on it. Several coworkers described experiences of being horribly berated by hatchet folks in HR based on ""complaints"" that HR would not clarify or explain. They described being pulled onto phone calls and told they have to ""apologize for what you did"", and when asked what they were talking about, would be told ""it's impossible that you don't know what we're talking about and if you don't then it's even worse than we thought."" Some have hypothesized this is how Salesforce rattles employees they, for whatever reason, decide they want to leave ( inside scoop indicates this is another maneuver by some VPs to create ""opportunities"" to shape an org the way they want when they get key folks to self-select out) but have no reason to push them out or worse yet, the employees were actually considered high performing by prior managers. I highly recommend anyone considering Salesforce to stay away unless it is the best you can get because its a huge company, if you get on the wrong side of just about anyone it could get really bad for you and there is nothing you can do.",24 people found this review helpful

I'm the only black person on my team, and even on our larger 30 person team, there are only 3 people of Asian descent (which is nuts considering tech demographics overall), everyone else is white or white-passing, and I don't see that changing anytime soon. There has been a lot of marketing recently about Salesforce meeting its 50% underrepresented goal a year early, but that number includes all women, and if it didn't they'd never meet their goal. A lot of middle managers are not interested in diversity and definitely not inclusion. Even if you're hired here as a black employee, you won't be treated equally and people will question your experience and abilities constantly. It's demoralizing, and it explains why retention is so low. I wouldn't recommend working here unless you have a bigger goal in mind for what you want to do next.",15 people found this review helpful

970,"Not the best, not the worst. Not a place for introverts","Dec 8, 2021 - Solution Engineer",3.0,Pay and benefits are good.,"Salesforce is better at buying outside talent than it is at developing its own people which is why there are so many boomerang employees. People leave to get the experience they need to go to the next role they want. There are no formal performance reviews meaning being promoted to your next role is very subjective depending on whether or not your leadership team likes you. Additionally, for the all the talk about showing up to work and embracing your authentic self, at the end of the day all anyone cares about is how you show up on a dashboard which incentives people to log things they did not do sometimes to an absurd degree like someone logging that they worked 70 hours a week every week for a quarter and then getting an award for most hours logged. Relatedly there is a huge emphasis placed on managing your personal brand. If you come from a cultural background where you are taught to do your best work day after day and expect that to be noticed in merit of itself, you will be disappointed working here at least in the sales organization. You have to have the desire to talk about yourself a lot and be a self promoter. Lastly, I want to share something I personally observed while working here. In my first sales team which was predominantly white, we had one female person of color on the team. She was exceptionally hard working, eager to learn, and dedicated to her job. Management and her colleagues did not support her in the way that was needed for her to reach her full potential. Moreover I believe they made work difficult for her in an effort to push her out of the organization. I never understood why. Maybe she didn't fit a type that her team was looking for. She later left to join another company where she is, unsurprising to me, doing very well. I would have thought that retaining and supporting talented employees of all backgrounds would be a priority but especially employees of color given how much Salesforce as a company talks about diversifying its workforce.",8 people found this review helpful

Upper management is 50/50 on saying the right thing vs saying something completely tone deaf (though admittedly, this ratio is still much better than most places). Work life balance is often talked about and encouraged, but when push comes to shove, the work has to get done, and sometimes you’re left holding the short end of that stick.",Be the first to find this review helpful

994,What a disappointment...,,3.0,- Benefits are top notch - Perks in the tower and holiday party are impressive - Sales tactics and strategies are great for growth even as an experienced rep - You’ll meet very talented sales rep with a wide variance of styles -ESPP - generous maternity/paternity leave. Although this will affect your likelihood of be promoted,"I came into Salesforce like every rep, excited and eager to get my “MBA” in sales. Working here you’ll have to be prepared to give up everything just to stay afloat. In the first year you will most likely be given a terrible territory and what you do with it will decide your future here. Things you will need to juggle effortlessly or will lead you down the road of being let go are: - Activity- lots of calls. People who fib numbers here are celebrated by leadership but frowned upon by reps - Opp rigor- the amount of fields you will need to update are mind numbing - Pipeline- with a terrible territory be prepared to pipe aspirational pipeline that will be highly scrutinized - Prep meetings- there are endless prep meetings before calls. Due to schedules each person involved will require a prep meeting, leaving your day with little time for anything else. - Team selling- be prepared to sell with folks much junior than you and not held to as high of standards. If the deal falls through, it’s on you. There are a few coprimes that are skilled sales reps - Your “brand”- It’s important to maintain appearances, even on bad days. Your brand is determined by how involved you are in diversity, volunteer work, and leading the team, which requires tenure. -Manager 1:1’s- these are a trap to look out for. Salesforce preaches trust as one of it pillars, but beware that everything said in those meetings will be used against you when they have soured on you - Time management- working a 12 hr day is table stakes. There are endless distractions you will need to navigate and make hard decisions on “brand”/ appearance maintenance vs selling The work/life balance is very heavy on the work side. The exec team repeatedly say their biggest regrets are not spending enough time with family. This will never change if they don’t take it serious. There is a lot you can learn here but at the expense of your self confidence as some managers make you feel worthless when your awful territory isn’t performing. If that isn’t enough to make you steer clear, the pay is very low and less than 20% of reps hit their annual numbers The “Ohana” culture is a mirage. There is nothing remotely familial about the culture. It is an ultra competitive pressure cooker. I just had such higher hopes for my experience left disappointed...",431 people found this review helpful

1030,Growth by Acquisition has killed the old Salesforce,,2.0,There are lots of smart and well-meaning people at Salesforce. Many non-sales do try and reflect the company values. Benefits are good (though not crazy) for a large tech company. New hires make a lot of money. Company has made a real effort to diversify and give women especially opportunities to move up (less so minorities). There are still a good number of old-time employees who genuinely care about the company and its values.,"As someone whose been with the company many years, it has transitioned from a smaller, agile, product-focused company to a Marketing and Sales holding company that does little or no product development. Nearly every major product announcement over the last few years featured huge fanfare, but resulted in the product dying a quiet end within 2 years. Pretty much every major product announcement now is just a Marketing 're-alignment', rebranding existing products, not actually developing anything new. All innovation is bought, not developed internally, and there is little sign that the various acquisitions (Mule, Tableau, Slack) are actually creating a 2+2=5 effect. It really feels like a bunch of independent companies that are owned by the same conglomerate. The focus on growth by acquisition also means very limited growth opportunities internally since the existing products aren't really growing or innovating significantly, it isn't creating new positions. A new, related phenomenon is that in order to retain talent, many low-to-middle managers are getting 'promotions in place', i.e. they are getting a bigger title and more money without additional responsibility because their orgs aren't growing. So you see lots of VPs with only two directs who are also VPs, creating lots of unnecessary layers of management who all feel they have to micromanage those below them in order to show they are 'adding value'. This lack of organic growth means a lot of people are attritting because they don't see any real career path. Career development isn't a focus beyond the first line of management. After that its all operations, process and programs. Manager success is evaluated on how many programs did you develop and market, not how many employees did you develop or how productive and happy is your team. Another issue is the split between the company image and Sales. While I do think a lot of product and engineering people do really believe in the company values, remember, this is a company founded by a Sales Guy. There is a very cutthroat sales mentality inherited from Oracle that often sees sales reps and leaders blatantly ignore values like trust, equality and customer success in order to hit their quarterly number. Sales is really the #1 value. The large and not rationalized product stack means that often sales reps are pitted against each other because they have overlapping products, and the result can be the customer gets the product of the better rep, not the product they need. Many products are 'zombie' products with no future product development and virtually no support staff, but because there are reps with quota on them, they are still being sold despite the fact that the customer will likely attrit in a couple of years once they realize they've been sold a lemon. Turnover in the Sales org also means a lot of inexperienced account execs who have zero understanding of the products or the company culture but are still being put on big accounts. Over and over you'll hear how solutions teams are the most vital part of the sales organization, but every award, spiff or shoutout goes to the sales rep. You'll hear about some amazing demo that sold the deal but the only names you will here are 5 different reps/AEs, like they did all the work themselves. They'll pat themselves on the back, go off to sales club and collect a massive commission and the SE will get back to work. Another thing most new employees won't notice at first because they just got their nice offer package, is that Salesforce hires at much higher dollar amount than it pays existing employees. Pretty much every new hire will make a LOT more than everyone else on a team. It's joked repeatedly that if you want a raise or promotion, your best option is to leave the company and get re-hired in a year. Stock is incredibly stingy. Unlike most tech companies that do yearly refreshes, you will be lucky to get new RSUs every 3-4 years, even for very top performers. Many relatively senior employees (15+ years overall experience, 4+ with company) have NO stock. A team of 10 might get 2-3 stock refreshes in a year. This is the #1 retention tool, and yet Salesforce consistently lags behind all competitors here. A lot of lip-service is given to the 'giving back' part of the company. When I joined this was for real. You got a week of VTO time, and if you used all that you'd get a sizeable grant to give to a charity of your choice. They removed the grants a few years ago without making any real announcement. The VTO time is still there but if you are above a certain level, you are on 'unlimited' PTO (which means you can take what you want, but only if your manager is cool AND you don't feel guilty about taking off during whatever crisis is currently happening). This makes the VTO time meaningless, since it just gets blurred in with PTO and sick leave.",2 people found this review helpful

1076,A great place to work that burns out employees,"Jul 13, 2022 - Strategic Enterprise Account Executive",3.0,"Every position at Salesforce will be a different experience, who you work for matters a lot, and what you sell will impact your experience. That being said, if you're in Sales at Salesforce, you are fuelling the rocketship growth and that isn't always the most enjoyable experience. Let's start with the good: Great benefits, mostly great products, the pay is competitive (although reps are leaving for better pay more frequently), there is plenty of company culture kool-aid, and you can make pretty good commissions if you hit accelerators with the right accounts. Salesforce looks good on a resume, and if you don't like where you land at first, there is plenty of lateral flexibility within the company.","The not-so-great: Salesforce is focused on growth and that means squeezing every penny out of its customers. To do this, they put a lot of sales reps into small territories. Sales reps are tasked with selling with big quotas and small territories. On the aggregate, Salesforce does well but individually it is becoming more and more difficult to hit quota. Less than 30% of Account Executives (AEs) actually hit their number if that tells you anything. Further, the resources around AEs internally are becoming more of an obstacle than a benefit. The hardest part of this job is getting others internally to do their jobs. If you raise your concerns, someone will hear you and then nothing will get done. You will just be making excuses. There are a lot of great sales professionals at Salesforce. However, with smaller territories, the good AEs are leaving. The newbies who are still learning are the ones trying to sell to customers. Customers complain about the constant churn of account teams. One of the top complaints is employee burnout and nothing seems to be done about it.",7 people found this review helpful

1079,Glasshouse,"Jul 29, 2022 - Account Executive in San Francisco, CA",2.0,Status Builder on your resume,"Below market pay, all about what is your ""brand"", how do you feel, little incentive on those who work hard. If you are a political or have a slight difference in view beware. Not friendly to those outside of their ""ideology"". This includes businesses as well. Don't trust your core business to them because they can ""terminate"" the agreement if they ""feel"" like it.",2 people found this review helpful
1080,Like working for a computer,"Jul 28, 2022 - Enterprise Account Executive",1.0,Paid parental leave Paid fertility benefits 1 Friday off a month for wellness Unlimited PTO,"-Not up front about role and territory before hiring (may give you a terrible role and you won't find out until it's too late. They don't change roles within a fiscal year so goodbye happiness and pay). -Cut throat people who do not help each other. SO much ego. Be ready to work with tons of people who think they are God's gift to the world. They'll be super fake but not help. -Be ready to learn everything on their internal Google that is terrible. Need help? Log a ticket. Got a question? Log a ticket. Have an issue? Log a ticket. Ticket didn't help? Log another ticket. -Training takes weeks and will be unrelated to your actual job -Internal support resource teams will say no most of the time and RVPs don't have the ability to do anything about it -If an internal team does help, be ready for them to take months to actually do what is asked. Things are never expected in a timely manner. -Goals are a joke. Majority of reps never get close to them so your actual take home pay will be much less than you anticipate regarding commission -You'll want to scream it's so frustrating. You'll feel very alone. Be careful before deciding to work for this company. The media shares how wonderful it is but realistically they do not care about you at all and treat you like a robot.",8 people found this review helpful
