Stress and burnout at this company is concerning. Politics! Keeping 10-15 people aligned on your plan every time is exhausting. Not have the autonomy to work in the way you know you can is frustrating and due to the pace, you really only ever offer around 70%. Yet, the pace is mystifying knowing that there are so many people to do every little element of a job. Sometimes you are left wondering what you role actually is. I think some people make a career out of attending in-house ""events"".

V2MOM system sounds like kool-aid at first but it actually works in aligning the goals of the company.",Release cadence of Core (3 times a year) is forced on the rest of the company even if it doesn't make sense for the product you're on. Forced to dogfood our own internal project management software (GUS) which only maintained by a very small team. Open headcount is distributed blindly to projects that are stack-ranked in priority and there's not much to go around after the top 2 or 3 start hiring.,1 person found this review helpful

If only I was born a male I could probably have stayed!",If you are a woman you will spend years trying to break through the extremely tight knit boys club. What makes it even harder is the PR about women completely contradicts the experience of many women who work here. The boys network will actively exclude women and block them as they fear they will do a better job. Mostly male leadership teams and now great women are leaving and being replaced by men.,6 people found this review helpful

78,Senior AE,"Jan 17, 2019 - Account Manager in Toronto, ON",3.0,Outstanding Product and ability to anticipate future correctly as they always seem to make the correct choices around Roadmap. Salesforce prides itself on #Ohana which means family. It is core value/belief of company and makes it an incredible company to work for; Unless you are in Sales,"3 things have changed for me as having been with company for long time and I consider them all Cons 1. Salesforce prides itself on #ohana which is family. Salesforce #ohana is vibrabnt and alive and incredible. Unless you are in Sales in which case its non existent. It is run old school the Oracle way. 2. Customers suffer the most as they did when Sales Leadership ran Oracle. Salesforce is ruthless in scraping every penny from the client, making MSA difficult by not giving an inch on anything. Management wants the number period, if it helps the customer thats a bonus. 3. Execs get paid AE's do not. There are essentially 4 - 5 levels of Sales Management before you get to Keith Block. On the Ground Floor 7 AE's may each carry a number such as $2,000,000 US. There RVP number is not $14,000,000 but about $10 or $11,000,0000. This continues up the management change so at the highest level they will carry a quota that will significantly less the what the AE's carry. End result is Significant amount of reps will be below 50% attainment and my guess is a few percent will knock it out and may 10 to 15% actually hit their number. Opportunity to make real money like in the old days is very slim. Lot of Starving AE's which the company does not seem to mind as they make it very clear there are 10 people behind you waiting for your job.",13 people found this review helpful

It's cost savings at the expense of employees interests. - Uncertainty over future unified office location in Dublin.,3 people found this review helpful
162,Do not join the Salesforce Support or CSG team,,3.0,- Great pay. - Excellent benefits.,"1. If you're hired as ""Success Agent Tier-2"" for CRM support then your Salesforce career is over because you'll be working in a specific skill group (Configuration, Usage or Email team) and do not get any chance to explore the real Salesforce CRM tool. 2. Management do not to monitor/plan their employees leaves(PTO's) properly which again makes very difficult to work with a huge backlog of cases. You can expect 25-30 cases per agent in AMER shift or 30-35 cases per agent in EMEA shift. NOTE: I have worked in Wipro (worst of all IT companies) so I am very well aware of overload/ extra amount of work. 3. They do not have enough ""Tier-3"" resource which makes your life miserable because as Tier-2, you'll be the only point of contact for the customer who has raised a case. If customer escalates the case or gives you DSAT due to the delay in resolution, then it won't affect Tier-3's performance. Management will simply blame you. 4. So many bugs/ Known issues in every major releases which will make you cry like hell as a support agent. 5. If you ask CSG management to hire more resources to reduce the back log, they'll simply say - ""No we cannot because we do not have enough budget"". 6. HR team sends out an employee survey link in each quarter but that doesn't make any change in your work life. 7. Also when it comes to ""Employee referral""(if your friends, relatives or siblings gets hired then you get $2000/each) program in Hyderabad is one of the most ""Corrupted"" program they've. I have seen 3 examples of corruption in referrals where managers referred their siblings who has really good terms with the ""hiring manager"". They all got selected and each manager earned easy $2000 + Family member (as a salesforce employee). So again if you're hired as Success agent Tier-2 then forget about referring anyone. 8. No way you will get Onsite chance. Strict policy. Also please do not dream of getting free passes/visit to Dreamforce event especially if you're in India. ()",39 people found this review helpful

166,Business Development Representative,,5.0,* I've worked in a few companies at this point and I can honestly say I love this company. * Great culture with an inclusive nature to it. * Management are great and look for your insight as much as possible. * You work hard. We have A LOT of products that need to be sold and so the learning curve is steep. In this vein its obvious why its generally known that having Salesforce on your CV basically guarantees you a good job in sales in pretty much any company of your choosing should you ever decide to leave.,* As mentioned the learning curve is steep. It can become overwhelming at times in terms of learning the products but also trying to perfect your sales technique. The support structures are there but if you are previously unexperienced in tech sales (like i was) there will be days when you feel a lot of pressure.,2 people found this review helpful

This in turn will lead to continued and increasing integration challenges and internal company friction; Biggest internal issue I see is that the 'Ohana' culture is leading to employees being too comfortable in their way of doing things and not striving enough for improvement. Combined with this, many managers have lulled themselves into following simplistic metrics and KPIs without understanding the underlying basis for the measurements, nor whether or not they are actually fit for purpose. Arising from this cultural laziness, leadership simply do not have the courage to challenge the status quo and drive the changes needed to improve the company's performance.

The commissions paid monthly were good, employee discounts with the likes of Apple, movie vouchers, free drinks, fruit and snacks and healthcare benefits for you and your family especially in those unexpected incidents is just outstanding. The leadership that came from Atlanta was very charismatic. I recall times when the VO Sales would jump on a call with a prospect at the 11th hour remotely at the oddest time to help regional teams. Who does that? It’s things this you will always remember. In terms of people, when you find a core group of individuals whom you trust and can lean of for advise and support, it goes a really long way in otherwise a very demanding role","Don’t get all too bubbly with what you see in public about this company with their philanthropic model of giving back and rising stocks because behind closed doors it has to be one of the worst experiences as a sales professional. 1. I don’t think SF thought about the Exact Target and Pardot acquisitions because it created a lot of issues such as internal conflict between Exact Target and Pardot reps over the right solution for an interested customer, 2. Salesforce Account Execs having to put quota relief size over the right solution and with Pardot the smaller investment price tag over its Exact Target meant you would lose out pretty much all of the time. 3. The quotas in the upper customer segments were not aligned to the sales cycles and instead geared towards the SMB segments. 4. Little empathy from the local leadership who were well aware of these challenges and instead ignore the issue as the revenue seemed to be the only concern. There is a reason why there is a high churn it nobody there seems to care.

256,Heroku,"Jul 30, 2018 - Principal Member of Technical Staff",5.0,"Heroku has had its ups and downs over the last few years as it has become more integrated with the larger Salesforce org, but it still feels staffed by the best minds in the business, and I love the product that we make. Salesforce itself has all the pros and cons of a large org, complete with hawaiian culture kool-aid and large-org inertia, but on the whole it feels like Benioff puts his money where his mouth is on societal issues, in a way that few corporate titans do. They're generous when it comes to family and benefits and have a corporate culture of giving. Inside Heroku, we are still a little bit inside our purple-tinted bubble. On balance it feels like the engineers, junior to senior, are a standard deviation or two above the median. The problems we solve are difficult and satisfying. The business is large and the opportunity remains even larger. It feels miraculous that we operate a product at such crazy scale with so few people, and speaks to our expertise in building scalable, automated things.","These are more Heroku issues than Salesforce issues. We were (and still are) strapped for headcount over many years. This leads to serious team health issues and burnout. Exec is keenly aware of the issue and taking steps to fix it, but it should never have gotten this bad. At the moment, our product org is also sorely understaffed following turnover and departures, which means that many engineering teams don't have anyone to help them make sound product choices. We get by, but the product roles are critical, and the product managers we have are spread way too thin. As above, our exec team is aware of the problem and trying to hire as fast as they can. These are short- to medium-term issues. I believe they'll get worked out and we'll have smoother sailing in a few months. Longer term, my larger concern is complacency. I don't know if Heroku/Salesforce has the gumption to make the big bets to really grow our business and remain relevant for the next epoch. For the last decade we've made it drastically simpler to run compute workloads in the cloud, and it's built a large and successful business. With containerization catching on and tooling becoming more mature, we're being commoditized. I don't know that exec has the appetite to determine what the next ""git push heroku master"" is, and allocate enough resources to pursue it. That feels like an existential threat.",1 person found this review helpful
257,Great,"Aug 8, 2018 - Anonymous Employee",3.0,"Amazing training and enablement, plus encouragement to follow your desired career path within the company","While Salesforce touts its 'Ohana', being in a company that size means that you do feel like a number sometimes rather than a person. Can be a very intense place to work. While they do promote work-life balance, the amount of work you have on your plate means that you're working long hours and weekends a lot of the time.",3 people found this review helpful

Because of that, I need to mention they ended the contract of other 20 people the were working in the team. (all had to look for a new job) They only offered 1 month salary as compensation nothing more. I have already paid for a new accommodation where I was a guarantor for other 2 people. I brought proof. They didn't care. And this is how people end up in the streets (unless you can find a job in one week or own some savings) So much of the OHANA spirit they are so proud of!",16 people found this review helpful
