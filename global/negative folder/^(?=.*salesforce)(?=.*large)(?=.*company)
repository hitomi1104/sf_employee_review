2376,"Have you ever felt like just a number to a company? Well once you start your job at salesforce you become just one of the many thousands of AEs they have hired. You will be given a territory that will ultimately dictate how well you perform. Some AEs are given 2-3 territories while others are given just one. Regardless of your territory, you will have the exact same quota as those with larger ones. Its a numbers game to management. Your manager will want 2-3 of his or her AEs to do really well while everyone else struggles. You will have a monthly quota, your manager will be tasked with grinding you every month for every last dollar possible you can bring in. Not to mention 3 quarter ends and 1 year end, which many managers make you feel like the world is ending thereafter. Forget about a vacation at month end, quarter end or god forbid you have to miss January 31st."
