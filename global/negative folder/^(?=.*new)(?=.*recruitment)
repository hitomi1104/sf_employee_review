6873,"1. Poor onboarding of new employees. Esp. if you are part of a team that doesn't have a presence in Hyderabad or your Boss sits in a different office. 2. The recruitment team is not friendly/professional during the hiring process. The hiring process took almost 10 weeks and I had to call at least 10 - 15 times to remind them to release the offer (even the hiring manager confirmed I have been hired) 3. Information overflow (very poor signal to noise ratio). Sometimes you will be amazed at so many emails/chatter flying around you and you don't know what to do abou it. 4. The Employee Success Team (HR) needs to pull their socks up. As a new employee, I had faced several problems in the early days. I asked for help, but they were never there. It felt they just don't care."
