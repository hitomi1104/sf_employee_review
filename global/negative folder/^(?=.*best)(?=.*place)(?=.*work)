289,as per my experience best place to work
300,"I was with Salesforce for a year. When I started I was made a lot of promises regarding the territories being fair within the team. However, once I got my territory and saw how it was compared to other territories across the team, I realized that 80% of the territories in any given team are bad. Only 20% of the accounts/territories are good and in which the sales people make money. And Management knows this. So if you are an Account Executive aligned well with Management, you are set. However, if you are like the 80% of the account executives, your fate is NOT in your hands as you will get bad accounts. They know this. The management's objective at least in the Toronto office is to only have 20% of the people make their #. They dont want anyone to be 200% of their #. They expect 80% of the reps to miss their #. The territories are extremely disparate. There's a lot of partiality in who gets what accounts. Be very careful when you join as an AE. For other roles like Marketing, Ops etc I've heard its a good place to work. However, for Sales its just like any other company. Dont fall for their lies when they tell you that the territories are fair. To give you a specific example, in the Toronto office there is one person who has 10 president's clubs. He makes a lot of money and his manager and his manager's manager are as expected totally aligned. He is a good rep. However, so are others on the team. However since he has always had the best territory the makes club every single year. Its ridiculous. If you've been in sales for a while, and comes across an environment where ONE person has made club 10 times and every one else has made club 1-2 times in the last 10 years, what would you conclude. The territories are uneven. The management is inept. For example this is the first company that I've come across where the Sales Manager's quota is not aligned with the team. For example in a team of 10 sales reps which a quota of $1M each, the manager doesnt have a $10M quota. His/her quota is way less than that. So even if the team misses their #, the manager makes his/her #. I had never seen that in my sales career. So to get promoted to a manager's role, you need to be connected to the right people. Be very careful in joining this company. For Sales its not as advertised. For other roles it might be different."
339,"Feel like I work in a cult sometimes (or drinking the ""kool-aid"") - the culture feels superficial and fake. Lots of lip service paid to being best place to work but the level of politics is demoralising and leadership is largely uninspiring working in pre-sales makes me feel like I have to be at the beck and call of the account execs. While most account execs are nice, there are some that make life a misery. As long as these account execs being in business, any bullying or manipulative behaviour is overlooked oracle people taking over the enterprise business. Culture there is terrible. Bullying culture prevalent. HR or ""employee success"" turn a blind eye - largely ineffectual."
365,"- Working from home is absolutely forbidden despite many of your colleagues living in different cities. - 4 sick days a year. If you take any more time from that, you'll then have to use your PTO hours. We get paid hourly, and they do not allow unpaid time off. - 8:30am to 5:00pm standard hours. Not sure why the extra half hour is needed. Don't even think of trying to leave at 4:57pm, even if you are crushing your targets. - Pay is below industry standard but most will argue, ""But you get to put Salesforce on your resume"". Most external hires take a lower salary than their previous job and oddly wear that as a badge of honour. That's how Salesforce executives want you to feel. The CEO is a billionaire, he didn't get there by paying his employees fairly. - Good luck trying to change departments if you ever feel like making a lateral move within the company. Salesforce has a policy stating you must stay in the same role for a minimum of 1.5 years before being allowed to move laterally into a different segment of the business. - Don't let them fool you with their ""best workplace"" awards. You won't feel that way in sales here."
519,"Some disadvantages are coming from the advantages indeed: - It’s really difficult to make good money. Target are increasing and OTE are reflected based on global plans , so it depends a lot on how lucky you are you will be able to reach your targets. - You will have to manage the relationship not just with your direct reporting, but wih different stakeholders who will have different interests. As an example, different AEs from different vertical products interested in selling into the same account, different RVPs to manage with. Alignment is one of the most important words in the company. Some days you will finalise your day thinking about how 90% of your calls were to manage talks with colleagues and not customers/ partners. - Depending on the area you are focus in, territory can be really big or small. This comes with the maturity of the product in the market. Per example , Core products AEs are really focus in small territories, however new products in the Org (Mulesoft, Commerce ,...) counts with small teams yet. These AEs are focus in strategic deals and normally cannot support all the opportunities properly. At the end, quotas are increasing because of new products in the portfolio , but you cannot have the same level of support like in mature ones. So I would say it depends how lucky you are with an specific account your co prime could make a big piece of the quota. - I don’t personally believe you have to be the best sales person in the world to sell in Salesforce. Marketing investment and resources are super huge, some customers buy the vision and what they see in events many times , plus there is plenty of really experienced partners in the region. I would say your results at the end of the year will depend 30% of your work and 70% how lucky you are with your territory , maturity of your account and the work of your co-primes - If you like the start uptype of experience , this is not a place where you will be comfortable for a long time (I must confess smaller regions like Iberia are closer to a start up type of company thought ) However, sometimes you will have the feeling you will spend more time reporting, reading Quips, covering different events, than thinking strategically how to gain relationships, trust and projects. - This company can help you win good money, but reducing your health due to stress and long time at work. Work life balance is challenging. There is not an ending point , you will have to be really good Managing this point to have everyone happy : you (and your health , your closer family (that will have to be open on you travelling and spending long hours at work, and the company) This point is being really important. Some people are leaving , or thinking about doing it, because of this last reason. Retaining employees is key for the company. Many important people use to leave (mostly coming from the acquisitions) because they don’t get use to the way the company operates. A lot of people are ex oracles, this can creates a local culture where not anyone might be confortable with."
571,This is a chaotic place to work at best. This chaos gives you opportunity but you are also sometimes on your own to sink or swim. Go there if only you are ready.
673,"ORACLE 2.0 -This terminology has been tossed around a lot thorough out these reviews. I view the Oracle effect on Salesforce through the following: 1) Middle Management -This is probably the worst part of Salesforce. These ""managers"" have been placed into these positions as the company grew too quickly. Salesforce will take Account Executives and place them into management positions without previous coaching/mentor experience -As a result, many (not all) of these managers will bastardize AEs. They are very quick to through AEs under the bus to save their image. -These managers have no skills at coaching, helping, or mentoring. -I have personally been involved in one-on-one meetings where I have experienced a manager insulting myself and my work. I have witnessed AEs quit after one-on-one meetings as their manager pushed them beyond limits. -I have also witnessed managers insult clients. If the client ""pushes a deal"" outside of the month it is forecasted, managers will become overly aggressive with the client to pull it back. Sometimes this tactic works, but it upsets the client and destroys future relationships. -Middle management will pick their favourite AEs and provide everything possible to ensure their success. 1.5, 2, 3x territories. Providing the best territories to their favourites. -I left Salesforce as my manager was insulting, rude, aggressive, upsetting to clients, and deceiving. They were not a coach, mentor, or visionary. 2) Territory Management -As stated in the Middle Management section, some AEs will get 1.5, 2, or 3x the territories -Management will tell you that each territory is cut evenly (laughable). So if an individual has 2x territories, they should have enough business to close 2x monthly quota -Even though these lucky AEs have double the territories, your monthly quota is equal to theirs -If these lucky individuals sell 50% of plan in each territory (making up 100%) and you hit 98% of your plan, middle management will act like these individuals are the next Glengarry Glen Ross. Middle Management won't even give you a pat on the back. -It is unfortunate to witness some individuals burn out quickly because they have to work 10x harder in a single territory as others have 2 or 3x territories with the same quota. 3) Transformation of the AE Role -When I first started, AEs were viewed as ""consultants"" with your clients. Your objective was to thoroughly work with your clients to uncover opportunities, manage the projects, and develop thorough business cases. Most importantly, we were to know our clients' business inside and out. -The AE role has now changed into a business development rep. -Middle management will have you call blitz your clients (which they clients get annoyed with), try to identify an opportunity, then pass it to a co-prime (Pardot, Data.com, Service Cloud, Desk). -The AE no longer works throughout the sales cycle. Management seeks to make the AE role into a transactional based environment -This is upsetting to anyone who enjoys relationship selling. -Many clients are becoming annoyed with the various AEs and Co-Primes continually connecting with them. 4) Quick Wins Now vs. Strategic Larger Deals -Management is so focused on monthly quotas that they will push AEs and clients into decisions before the sales cycle is complete -This could negate larger strategic deals as the client gets a ""band-aid"" fix."
739,"Salesforce falls short in how they treat their G&A teams. Succeeding in G&A is not based on skills, qualifications, or ability. As a qualifier, I am not saying this out of spite for being passed over for a promotion or a raise, as I have not even tried for those opportunities yet, this is based on the observations I have of other people in the workforce. First issue, G&A treats those in the main offices much better than they do some of the smaller offices. There truly is a disparate treatment between those in main hubs and those in smaller offices. If you are not located in a main hub, regardless of if the position needs to be at one of the hubs, you have a nearly 0% chance of being given the same opportunities as those in the main hubs. They will not look at what you have accomplished nor will they recognize the value you provide to the company. They will promote from the main hubs or place people in positions that are in the main hubs without even considering other employees across the country. The other key to being given opportunities in the G&A functions is to campaign for the position. Even if you are not the most qualified, if you can make people think you are, Salesforce G&A leadership will not even do interviews to determine who is best for the job. They will wave their little magical wand and poof, the person who has less skills and abilities, but who knew who to align themselves with and convince they are better than everyone else will get moved into positions of authority. If you are a person who does not mind being dishonest, immoral, and you are willing to put down and crush those around you, apply for a G&A function in one of the main Salesforce offices around the country, you will move up quickly and never have to worry about actually knowing your stuff before you are promoted. You may not even need to wait for a position to open up, they may just create a brand new position for you. If you are a great worker who does not like to step all over other people to move up or if you are not in one of the main offices this is not the place for you. They will not even listen to your qualifications skills or abilities when positions open up."
904,This isn't really a negative but be prepared to work hard and learn a lot. You are surrounded by some of the top students across the nation along with some of the smartest managers. It's a competitive company to get into. If you expect the best of yourself then you're in the right place.
1048,"Salesforce produces Entitled and quite frankly, arrogant people. They tell you to pat yourself on the back because ""its harder to get into Salesforce than Harvard""... people repeat this at bootcamp, when they didn't even attend Harvard. Training is all online Trailhead badges, and not personal training with objection handling, interaction and just a bunch of ""Salesforce is the best and the competitor sucks"", their management and team breeds arrogance, ignorance and lack of humanity. Salesforce is all smoke and mirrors, great place to work, but their sales teams all stab eachother in the back. Try asking people about the relationships between EMEA and NorthAmerica on accounts. They claim #1 place to work but ask around, people get sick of being a cog in the corporate system. Salesforce is great marketers but peel back the onion, on integrating the clouds."
1060,"Fake culture - depending on your department, all the ""best place to work"" image isn't true. Salesforce spends a lot of money making the company look amazing but internally, they don't treat their employees that great (depending on department of course). Company also wastes a lot of money on frivolous things just to add to this image"
1500,Nothing for the moment.. Really best place to work
1508,"JP office is extremely domestic, and does not have the drive, momentum or speed which other international tech firms or a typical foreign sub company has as a working culture. Since the majority of the people in the back office has been working here for a very long time (which is a good thing in one way), many of them are not use to changes - rather prefer to stick to the norm. Ohana is one of the key culture (which is a great conceptually) in Salesforce. But in JP back office, this is recognized in a different/miss leading manner. More specifically, it's been recognized as ""protection"", rather than supporting and challenging each other for growth. This shows up as lack of ownership, professionalism and extremely conservative working style/attitude. If you try to challenge someone, you're taken in a different way. Since there's really no culture of challenging each other, it's taken very offensively --- that's still fine but the most shocking part is, senior management doesn't notice or understand anymore of the benefits of growth via challenges and constructive communication. This is one of the most disappointing aspects of this office where it doesn't show to the outer world --- I have seen another review saying ""a master of disguise"" and completely understand what it means. When joining, do not expect a high paced, competitive working style lead by professionals with strong ownership --- but rather expect a conservative environment, hence for those who are looking for growth via challenges, constructive communication and data driven decision makings, this may not be the best place for you. Money is good, but growth wise, not able to recommend."
2196,"Your experience here will completely depend on your direct manager and reporting line - and that's a very mixed bag of people. There is a lot of ego at play in some leaders and a total lack of EQ/empathy - be sure to interview your manager through the hiring process. There is nothing as demotivating as a sales manager who doesn't have basic leadership skills or self awareness. They have over hired Account Executives as they believe that this will drive limitless growth in the region. Result being that everyone has territories that are too small to give them a reasonable chance at succeeding. Attainment is poor even from those who have been with the business a number of years and have been successful in their previous roles. This DOESN'T stop huge amounts of pressure being placed on each individual to hit pipe gen and sales targets (even during COVID). Very few people have hit their quota or anywhere near it in the last few years. 5-7 years ago this probably would have been a great place to work but it has changed considerably since then. People don't trust the anonymous feedback surveys so the business doesn't understand the huge amount of grumbling that is happening behind the scenes. AEs are unhappy and many are looking elsewhere. But management also does its best to make you fearful about leaving in order to keep you in place to avoid more turnover. They made most of their customer success group redundant last year. Aside from COVID, there seems to be a major aversion to letting people work from home which to me highlights that there is a lack of trust in their people. Some management speak down to their team like they are children. Very few female leaders in the sales team - not sure the organisation is honestly asking themselves why this is? People talk the talk about diversity because it's a SFDC value but that's not necessarily how they really think or execute. I don't even think most of them are capable of thinking outside their own experience."
3770,"Wages are stagnant, not keeping pace with inflation-in the United States is 6.8% for the 12 months ended November 2021, meaning with the 4-5% raises we are expecting, we enter 2022 behind. Attrition is becoming a serious issue. Getting VERY big and a series of promotions from without and seemingly disingenuous internal promotion systems (you cannot brag about how many new roles are open when a majority of these new roles are already spoken for by the people in the roles you killed off). This make it the best dead end job you'll ever have. Salesforce has reached that place where leadership thinks only outsiders can help make change vs. looking who they work with and their capabilities. After a decade, if I had a good opportunity come up, I'd leave."
4035,"- Toxic sales culture, growth is highest priority, including over the code of conduct and values - Execution to advertised best workplace are not reality, and are often marketing campaigns or gimmicks (such as equal pay for women) - Lack of diversity - particularly in most valued sales, technology positions"
4366,"Salesforce is better at buying outside talent than it is at developing its own people which is why there are so many boomerang employees. People leave to get the experience they need to go to the next role they want. There are no formal performance reviews meaning being promoted to your next role is very subjective depending on whether or not your leadership team likes you. Additionally, for the all the talk about showing up to work and embracing your authentic self, at the end of the day all anyone cares about is how you show up on a dashboard which incentives people to log things they did not do sometimes to an absurd degree like someone logging that they worked 70 hours a week every week for a quarter and then getting an award for most hours logged. Relatedly there is a huge emphasis placed on managing your personal brand. If you come from a cultural background where you are taught to do your best work day after day and expect that to be noticed in merit of itself, you will be disappointed working here at least in the sales organization. You have to have the desire to talk about yourself a lot and be a self promoter. Lastly, I want to share something I personally observed while working here. In my first sales team which was predominantly white, we had one female person of color on the team. She was exceptionally hard working, eager to learn, and dedicated to her job. Management and her colleagues did not support her in the way that was needed for her to reach her full potential. Moreover I believe they made work difficult for her in an effort to push her out of the organization. I never understood why. Maybe she didn't fit a type that her team was looking for. She later left to join another company where she is, unsurprising to me, doing very well. I would have thought that retaining and supporting talented employees of all backgrounds would be a priority but especially employees of color given how much Salesforce as a company talks about diversifying its workforce."
4425,"As someone whose been with the company many years, it has transitioned from a smaller, agile, product-focused company to a Marketing and Sales holding company that does little or no product development. Nearly every major product announcement over the last few years featured huge fanfare, but resulted in the product dying a quiet end within 2 years. Pretty much every major product announcement now is just a Marketing 're-alignment', rebranding existing products, not actually developing anything new. All innovation is bought, not developed internally, and there is little sign that the various acquisitions (Mule, Tableau, Slack) are actually creating a 2+2=5 effect. It really feels like a bunch of independent companies that are owned by the same conglomerate. The focus on growth by acquisition also means very limited growth opportunities internally since the existing products aren't really growing or innovating significantly, it isn't creating new positions. A new, related phenomenon is that in order to retain talent, many low-to-middle managers are getting 'promotions in place', i.e. they are getting a bigger title and more money without additional responsibility because their orgs aren't growing. So you see lots of VPs with only two directs who are also VPs, creating lots of unnecessary layers of management who all feel they have to micromanage those below them in order to show they are 'adding value'. This lack of organic growth means a lot of people are attritting because they don't see any real career path. Career development isn't a focus beyond the first line of management. After that its all operations, process and programs. Manager success is evaluated on how many programs did you develop and market, not how many employees did you develop or how productive and happy is your team. Another issue is the split between the company image and Sales. While I do think a lot of product and engineering people do really believe in the company values, remember, this is a company founded by a Sales Guy. There is a very cutthroat sales mentality inherited from Oracle that often sees sales reps and leaders blatantly ignore values like trust, equality and customer success in order to hit their quarterly number. Sales is really the #1 value. The large and not rationalized product stack means that often sales reps are pitted against each other because they have overlapping products, and the result can be the customer gets the product of the better rep, not the product they need. Many products are 'zombie' products with no future product development and virtually no support staff, but because there are reps with quota on them, they are still being sold despite the fact that the customer will likely attrit in a couple of years once they realize they've been sold a lemon. Turnover in the Sales org also means a lot of inexperienced account execs who have zero understanding of the products or the company culture but are still being put on big accounts. Over and over you'll hear how solutions teams are the most vital part of the sales organization, but every award, spiff or shoutout goes to the sales rep. You'll hear about some amazing demo that sold the deal but the only names you will here are 5 different reps/AEs, like they did all the work themselves. They'll pat themselves on the back, go off to sales club and collect a massive commission and the SE will get back to work. Another thing most new employees won't notice at first because they just got their nice offer package, is that Salesforce hires at much higher dollar amount than it pays existing employees. Pretty much every new hire will make a LOT more than everyone else on a team. It's joked repeatedly that if you want a raise or promotion, your best option is to leave the company and get re-hired in a year. Stock is incredibly stingy. Unlike most tech companies that do yearly refreshes, you will be lucky to get new RSUs every 3-4 years, even for very top performers. Many relatively senior employees (15+ years overall experience, 4+ with company) have NO stock. A team of 10 might get 2-3 stock refreshes in a year. This is the #1 retention tool, and yet Salesforce consistently lags behind all competitors here. A lot of lip-service is given to the 'giving back' part of the company. When I joined this was for real. You got a week of VTO time, and if you used all that you'd get a sizeable grant to give to a charity of your choice. They removed the grants a few years ago without making any real announcement. The VTO time is still there but if you are above a certain level, you are on 'unlimited' PTO (which means you can take what you want, but only if your manager is cool AND you don't feel guilty about taking off during whatever crisis is currently happening). This makes the VTO time meaningless, since it just gets blurred in with PTO and sick leave."

4888,Can't think of anything. Anyday best place to work.
5033,"Salesforce is surprisingly political, especially when you consider how the brand is fun and there's a genuine ""do good"" ethos of philanthropy at the company. Salesforce attracts high performers, which is great in many ways but also leads to a very ""type A"" aggressive, win-at-all-cost environment. Add on top of that the fact that Marc likes to make multiple bets and encourage internal competition (it's why there are two customer service products that sometimes directly compete, two salesforce automation products, etc.). So you end up with a workplace culture that, while exceedingly positive and gracious on the surface, is actually quite cut-throat and reliant on personal connections over merit. I saw multiple examples of mid-level managers making decisions based on what would most impress the boss over what was best for the company, let alone the customer. There's an obsession with BSOs (Big Shiny Objects) that cost a fortune and have little impact on the business but can be touted internally in presentations to leadership."
5079,Really not the best place for work life balance. Specific to my org unorganized not the clearest overall plan. Lack of support members to the ratio of employees.
5080,Can't think of anything. Anyday best place to work.
5558,"terrible middle-management, bullying of employees protected by HR, ability to get ahead rests solely on having a corporate ""sponsor"" internally (you get it) , bait and switch on territories, territories always very unequal even though they claim that they are all equal, high turnover has resulted in employees being given $10,000 spiffs this year for all hired sales referals - they claim this is due to growth but it is because AEs are often miserable, given an impossible job with an absurd quota, bullied until they experience physical and mental health problems (see ALL of the other reviews and associated comments posted here - click on the comments after each review, there are dozens or these reports), and then shown the door. you are either part of the ""old school"" crowd here who was with the company pre-IPO so like 5+ years at the company, or you are having a personal relationship with someone in management who is ""taking care of you,"" and then you are given preferential treatment i.e. vacation days not being tracked by your manager, cash-cow best territory year after year, etc. etc. ** OR YOU ARE NOT ** ... in which case you will probably not last here for more than 1-2 years, and probably not that long, because you will be treated poorly, given a territory that Benioff himself couldnt sell into (think rural Indiana and Idaho) and completely miserable. I can't count the # of AEs who fled this place in the 2009 timeframe - dozens. If you are crazy enough to take a job here, be sure you get the exact territory you will be covering written down as part of accepting the job offer - the bait and switch to lure people in here is well-known. You will be promised Chicago and leave your current job, get in the door, take your seat, and be given Louisiana (the boss' girlfriend will end up getting Chicago and no one will remember that you got told you were getting the Windy City - plus the boss' BF probably works in HR so no one to turn to in order to complain). Further, read ALL of the other reviews and comments here on Glassdoor.com - specifically the comments. Again there is a reason this company is giving out 10k referal bonuses to all employees who refer a salesperson who gets hired - and the employee(s) there will tell you how wonderful it is - they're desperate for new people to take the crap jobs so the AEs currently there get the good ones .... and the AEs want the 10k bonus for submitting your resume. They're so greedy for it - its all over LinkedIn constantly. PS - Don't believe the Forbes average salary hype either - that salary figure includes a tiny percentage of Sr. AEs who make $1M plus per year. Countless AEs didnt make jack above their base salary last year - ask about this. And if you get pushed out .... DO NOT LET THEM TALK YOU INTO SIGNING THEIR LEGAL WAIVERS TO PROTECT THEMSELVES"
5986,"Politics. If you have only worked at small companies, big companies are a different beast. Salesforce, like any big company, has an element of politicking to it. At any company playing ""the game"" is important, so expect that here. Large quotas, and small patches. Salesforce has fine tuned territory management, and some ae's have stronger patches than others. It is important to succeed early and often so that you have the credibility to be assigned stronger accounts. New employees not willing to hustle and prove themselves do not last. This is how every big company is in my experience. If you don't have a ton of sales experience, make sure you start at a lower title with a larger territory. Big companies are harder to ""learn the ropes at"", as you are competing with the best of the best for things like territory. Other than the above, Salesforce has been the best move in my career, and I'm thrilled and proud to work here. I've never found a place without the above cons, and the pros far outweigh them for me."

6796,"The ""best place to work for"" and ""ohana culture"" may be true for other countries or departments, but a big lie in Singapore Sales Development team. The management team is unreasonbale and sometimes even rude. The worst part is the politics.

7601,"You are truly just a number, and are very easily replaced. If you aren't a favorite of upper management (which is based solely on the number of hires you make a quarter, and nothing else whatsoever), you cannot succeed here. Salesforce claims to be the best company to work for, and from a birds eye view it is. But what they don't tell you about is the amount of politics, favoritism, back-stabbing, and lack of empathy from management and above."

They claim #1 place to work but ask around, people get sick of being a cog in the corporate system. Salesforce is great marketers but peel back the onion, on integrating the clouds."
8006,"For being a tech company, this place could not keep anyone in IT for longer than 2 years, it seemed. Salesforce has a ridiculous hierarchy that is rather militant in the way it handles internal communications (""My door is always open; however, you better not come to me before person a, b, c, and d""). There is 0 transparency although they preach this in every pointless meeting they make you sit through. This company caters heavily to the Sales side of business, and no where else. If you are IT in any sense of that side of business, then you can expect to be held to your best performing day for your entire career no matter how much of an outlier that day was, if you prove to be competent with what you do you can expect to be overloaded with work enough for those who are not, and then held to their expectations on top of your own. Oh, and those people will get promoted before you, because you are too ""valuable"" to move from your spot. And you can never expect to hear what you do right; every 1:1 you have with management is everything that you could possibly be doing better, always. No thanks, no 'atta-boys, nothing. You think you have co-workers in other departments? The people you assist are your companies User's that you support? Maybe these co-workers/users are your future friends/buddies? No. You have customers. And you treat them as such at all times. Your co-workers for the first few months of being hired are pretty great typically, until the vibe of this company is finally realized; which leads them into the cutthroat, every (wo)man for his/herself environment that management breeds. As a cherry on the top; Salesforce has this underlying community called femmeforce. Now this could be innocent, and it could potentially do a lot of great things; however this is not what it is being used for and many of the current management are women who are extremely active in this community for the wrong reasons. In our office 90% of the people who are leaving/being bullied out are male, and 70-80% of the new hires are women. The obvious preferential treatment, and the lack of others who care enough to do anything about it is ulimately why I left this company. I performed in the top 5 of a 40+ member team consistently across all stats; closures, professionalism, ""customer"" satisfaction, SLA; however, I was still offered an ultimatum: a severance package that is really hard to look away from, or the promise of an official write up that would not go the way I wanted, just because I was male working under a radical feminist. That is not a joke, and not an exaggeration."
8097,"I mean...it's hard to know where to start but I'll try to do my best. First, a lot of people talk about career and promotions - and how there's little to know transparency about the process, nepotism is rampant and the like. The company knows this, which is why ES has done away with giving performance reviews. Now, instead of being clear on what exactly you need to do to move up the chain, they're putting this on you. The result is that many people get promoted solely for political/favoritism , and people who actually have technical skills can get lost if there is no one mentoring them on how to play the game. And as other people have mentioned, employees do get rated by their managers every year, but they never see the results of their evaluation. The typical ES response to this will be ""Salesforce is not for everyone"" - but this should not take the place of transparency around the promotion process, especially in a company that touts itself on being transparent in every other way. The whole situation is a really messed up way of dealing with the fact that there are too many talented and driven people here. Work life balance, especially in regional roles, is nonexistent. During a regional rotation, I was actually paid less than my San Francisco salary per our mobility policies, but I was expected to lead projects in San Francisco AND the regional location. The result was 15-18 hour days, 6 days per week. Even though I discussed the concerns I had with my manager, their response was the typical ""Maybe Salesforce just isn't for you."" The situation did finally get better after I sought legal advice, and realized that this type of working structure was actually illegal per the local environment. However, it was clear that the escalation was seen as politically incorrect, and the regional rotation quickly became a dead end with no career growth or development. I was lucky enough to find a team in San Francisco that was willing to take me as a way out, but I share this as a cautionary tale for anyone considering taking on a similar role. Make sure you have a good local attorney, as many teams at Salesforce are predatory, and see the rotational experience as a way to get you to take on more for less money - they will retaliate against you if you try to escalate concerns about your work environment (and on the other side, try getting anyone in San Francisco to take a call before 8am or after 5pm, and people will act like you're crazy - it's a complete double standard). Salesforce is going to start offering more and more roles like this outside of San Francisco to reduce costs, so be sure you know what you're getting yourself into and how you'll be supported if you take one of these on. Operations are a complete mess with many groups doing the same thing, each one trying to assert themselves. Ever since I've been here, there seems to be a focus on wellness, though this gets rebranded time and again as different initiatives. The end result is that people are super driven from 8-5, but cut corners so they can make it to that 5:30pm yoga class. I'm not saying people should work 24/7, but this is an example of how Salesforce and its culture often embody mixed messages (grow grow grow but make sure you have a balance). The result is a lot of groups who say ""This isn't my problem/I'm not owning it/Find someone else to talk to."" In a matrixed environment, this becomes really frustrating - especially as the company has gotten so much bigger. Ultimately, the Company is becoming larger and more bureaucratic - many employees are not receiving raises this year because the company wants to focus on bottom line growth at the expense of its people. At some point over the last 10 years, my day became 100% focused on managing the politics as opposed to creating value and focusing on work I enjoy. Because of this, I've decided to leave Salesforce after a long ride. It's bittersweet, but kind of like that song - ""You don't have to go home, but you can't stay here""; the writing is on the wall in terms of where this company is going - the culture has is getting more and more eroded with the growth. As a final word of warning, I will just encourage all potential candidates to take Salesforce marketing with a grain of salt. Salesforce is one of the only companies I know of that has an internal marketing team who is tasked with trying to tell you how you should feel about the company. Yes, it's true - they have done a lot of great things, but usually the motivation behind it is much more about showing how this initiative is part of the Salesforce brand, as opposed to genuinely providing assistance to someone or some organization that needs help."
8142,"- Being a large company there can be decent of admin. navigation that you need to do sometimes. If you came from a larger organization this won't be any worse. There's many tools to help you. No place is perfect (I really wanted to rate 4.65 out of five but rounded up) That said, this is the best place I've worked."
8548,"They promote equality but the reality is the environment is toxic. Filled with 'preference' and bias, if your boss like you then you can get the good set of accounts to work on, otherwise sorry you are on your own. To protect their image of best place to work, they 'create' lame reasons to make you leave on your own or terminate you, instead of being seen as firing / layoff people. Lots of politicking between management, the Ohana is a marketing gimmick, the reality is the management are mostly ex-oracle bringing along their old habits and culture and practicing them in here. Most of the great talent had left the company and the original good culture is dying. This will be the last place I recommend anyone to join."
8575,"JP office is extremely domestic, and does not have the drive, momentum or speed which other international tech firms or a typical foreign sub company has as a working culture. Since the majority of the people in the back office has been working here for a very long time (which is a good thing in one way), many of them are not use to changes - rather prefer to stick to the norm. Ohana is one of the key culture (which is a great conceptually) in Salesforce. But in JP back office, this is recognized in a different/miss leading manner. More specifically, it's been recognized as ""protection"", rather than supporting and challenging each other for growth. This shows up as lack of ownership, professionalism and extremely conservative working style/attitude. If you try to challenge someone, you're taken in a different way. Since there's really no culture of challenging each other, it's taken very offensively --- that's still fine but the most shocking part is, senior management doesn't notice or understand anymore of the benefits of growth via challenges and constructive communication. This is one of the most disappointing aspects of this office where it doesn't show to the outer world --- I have seen another review saying ""a master of disguise"" and completely understand what it means. When joining, do not expect a high paced, competitive working style lead by professionals with strong ownership --- but rather expect a conservative environment, hence for those who are looking for growth via challenges, constructive communication and data driven decision makings, this may not be the best place for you. Money is good, but growth wise, not able to recommend."

9204,"I don't think this review will change anything inside the company, but I hope it will enable people considering to join take a more informed decision. 1] Consider this: They fired several people on the back of the strongest quarter in company's history, that too in the middle of pandemic! Mark promised no layoffs for 3 months, and looked like he was waiting for 3 months to be over. LOL. 2] Unhealthy competition between global teams. US teams typically are more prone to hiding information from other teams across the globe. If you don't know the requirement, you can't build the system, and if you can't build the system, you are labelled as incompetent. (Sr.) Directors/ (Sr.) Managers will NEVER take accountability to gather the necessary information, and delegate all work to ICs (even freshers in some case). Since ICs are ill-equipped to make senior managers or directors in the US to divulge information, they practically get blocked, which results in underperformance discussions for ICs. This brings me to the next important claim by Salesforce - ""Embrace Feedback and Promote Transparency""! 3] I personally know people who would speak up to management (""see something, say something""). Somehow, those were the people who typically got impacted by ""restructuring"". Secondly, all this talk about transparency, and they won't divulge your performance ratings to you. This is the only place this happens. So my question is, if the employee doesn't know how the manager sees their performance, how would they take an informed decision on what next to expect or even challenge that assessment. The performance conversations are always positive from managers, so managers don't need to worry about the internal survey ratings from their team! OH MY, WHAT A MESS. Who's to stop managers from saying you performed awesome, but put a rating of 2 in the backend system? There are more, but I think you would have got an idea by now that the work environment is, at best, extremely toxic inside the sugar coated candy that gets presented to the outside world."
