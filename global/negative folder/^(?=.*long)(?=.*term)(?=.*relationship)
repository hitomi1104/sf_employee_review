673,"ORACLE 2.0 -This terminology has been tossed around a lot thorough out these reviews. I view the Oracle effect on Salesforce through the following: 1) Middle Management -This is probably the worst part of Salesforce. These ""managers"" have been placed into these positions as the company grew too quickly. Salesforce will take Account Executives and place them into management positions without previous coaching/mentor experience -As a result, many (not all) of these managers will bastardize AEs. They are very quick to through AEs under the bus to save their image. -These managers have no skills at coaching, helping, or mentoring. -I have personally been involved in one-on-one meetings where I have experienced a manager insulting myself and my work. I have witnessed AEs quit after one-on-one meetings as their manager pushed them beyond limits. -I have also witnessed managers insult clients. If the client ""pushes a deal"" outside of the month it is forecasted, managers will become overly aggressive with the client to pull it back. Sometimes this tactic works, but it upsets the client and destroys future relationships. -Middle management will pick their favourite AEs and provide everything possible to ensure their success. 1.5, 2, 3x territories. Providing the best territories to their favourites. -I left Salesforce as my manager was insulting, rude, aggressive, upsetting to clients, and deceiving. They were not a coach, mentor, or visionary. 2) Territory Management -As stated in the Middle Management section, some AEs will get 1.5, 2, or 3x the territories -Management will tell you that each territory is cut evenly (laughable). So if an individual has 2x territories, they should have enough business to close 2x monthly quota -Even though these lucky AEs have double the territories, your monthly quota is equal to theirs -If these lucky individuals sell 50% of plan in each territory (making up 100%) and you hit 98% of your plan, middle management will act like these individuals are the next Glengarry Glen Ross. Middle Management won't even give you a pat on the back. -It is unfortunate to witness some individuals burn out quickly because they have to work 10x harder in a single territory as others have 2 or 3x territories with the same quota. 3) Transformation of the AE Role -When I first started, AEs were viewed as ""consultants"" with your clients. Your objective was to thoroughly work with your clients to uncover opportunities, manage the projects, and develop thorough business cases. Most importantly, we were to know our clients' business inside and out. -The AE role has now changed into a business development rep. -Middle management will have you call blitz your clients (which they clients get annoyed with), try to identify an opportunity, then pass it to a co-prime (Pardot, Data.com, Service Cloud, Desk). -The AE no longer works throughout the sales cycle. Management seeks to make the AE role into a transactional based environment -This is upsetting to anyone who enjoys relationship selling. -Many clients are becoming annoyed with the various AEs and Co-Primes continually connecting with them. 4) Quick Wins Now vs. Strategic Larger Deals -Management is so focused on monthly quotas that they will push AEs and clients into decisions before the sales cycle is complete -This could negate larger strategic deals as the client gets a ""band-aid"" fix."
927,Annual Musical Chairs doesn't help AEs who want to develop long term relationships Unrealistic Quota Goals set across the board regardless of past territory performance
943,"Depending on who your hiring manager is and how he likes you determines your success or failure. I have seen a lot of unfair treatment, people pushed out the org and a lot of people coming getting hired and promoted that made little to no sense. If you are not the person that likes to play up popularity and politics and just focus on YOUR JOB.... This place isn't for you. Also, if you are customer focused some of the protocol within the organization makes it extremely difficult to build a long term relationship and do what is right for the customer. Customers are spending more money and contracts are growing to the point they can not afford them. There's little you can do to help customers you have relationships with in a bind which frustrates lots of customers. Spend more time in sales doing customer service than selling."
1000,Sales Management is driven to grow at all costs. Culture of the firm is very positive and philanthropic messages are very positive however the maniacal need to grow 50% y/y puts customer success in second position over deal completion. The growth messages are coupled with sales culture that is not long term relationship (Trusted Advisor) messaging that the overall company convey's to the market.
2005,"Constant pressure to win new business every month. I understand that is the name of the game in sales. But we put customer relationships at-risk in the long-term because we are constantly asking them to upgrade or buy something more ""now"" instead of on their timeline. Long term relationships are more valuable than a quick deal just because our month is about to close."
2157,Work/life balance sadly out of whack. Some management resort to more stick than carrot to get short term bump in performance. Sometimes asked to sacrifice long term relationship with customer in exchange for small short term revenue.

6020,too short focused and does not value long term relationships with customers
6077,"Oracle, oracle, oracle. This is an inside sales dream job as SFDC puts it. If you are a seasoned sales rep stay away. Managers and AVPs are ACV whores. Do not care about the customer or long term relationship. You are as good as you next months deal."
7616,"Too large for their own good. Too much focus on metrics and not enough focus on micro culture and fostering long term relationships. There's an inevitable aura of competition that is felt, yet not said."
7978,Shrinking territories and increased quotas. Monthly cadence and unrealistic expectations from lower management. Focus is on monthly deals and not long term strategic relationships outside of the enterprise group. Closing deals is more important that happy clients.
