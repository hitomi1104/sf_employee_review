369,"Since the company is growing fast , all sort of people are there in middle management and these people are not following the basic Ohana culture of salesforce which Marc is dreaming about. If you are from an acquired company and not into salesforce tech stack, then be very careful , you will be fired immediately after your knowledge transfer and if they feel that you are no more required to carry on with the work, even though you had spent years together in the acquired company to build the product. No help whatsoever from HR or hiring managers for internal openings even though you learn and get certified in salesforce related technologies."
426,"Political, which is a given with the growth; middle management do not receive training in managing people and are often on power trips (likely based on insecurity); territories are far from equal and the company will double up territories for those they want to promote to make them look good and justify the promotion; too many people eg overlays, excessive levels of management trying to justify why they are employed and create a lot of extra work for AE's; takes away from selling and caring for the customers. Too much 'AE Enablement'...AE's are now Customer Success, Technical Support, Operations, Sales Engineers as instead of hiring resources, everyone wants to train AE's to do their job...not a good use of high paid employees and takes away from productivity and revenue driving activities. As AE's you are pretty much seen as a number and stat to 'stay in the box' without a lot of autonomy on how to spend your day. Lots of burnout if you get sucked into the monthly 'life or death' culture to meet quota or be ashamed."
630,"Too much middle management, and false titles. Company vision and direction are constantly changing. Some promotions are caused by political reasons, rather than having the best candidate for the job selected."
673,"ORACLE 2.0 -This terminology has been tossed around a lot thorough out these reviews. I view the Oracle effect on Salesforce through the following: 1) Middle Management -This is probably the worst part of Salesforce. These ""managers"" have been placed into these positions as the company grew too quickly. Salesforce will take Account Executives and place them into management positions without previous coaching/mentor experience -As a result, many (not all) of these managers will bastardize AEs. They are very quick to through AEs under the bus to save their image. -These managers have no skills at coaching, helping, or mentoring. -I have personally been involved in one-on-one meetings where I have experienced a manager insulting myself and my work. I have witnessed AEs quit after one-on-one meetings as their manager pushed them beyond limits. -I have also witnessed managers insult clients. If the client ""pushes a deal"" outside of the month it is forecasted, managers will become overly aggressive with the client to pull it back. Sometimes this tactic works, but it upsets the client and destroys future relationships. -Middle management will pick their favourite AEs and provide everything possible to ensure their success. 1.5, 2, 3x territories. Providing the best territories to their favourites. -I left Salesforce as my manager was insulting, rude, aggressive, upsetting to clients, and deceiving. They were not a coach, mentor, or visionary. 2) Territory Management -As stated in the Middle Management section, some AEs will get 1.5, 2, or 3x the territories -Management will tell you that each territory is cut evenly (laughable). So if an individual has 2x territories, they should have enough business to close 2x monthly quota -Even though these lucky AEs have double the territories, your monthly quota is equal to theirs -If these lucky individuals sell 50% of plan in each territory (making up 100%) and you hit 98% of your plan, middle management will act like these individuals are the next Glengarry Glen Ross. Middle Management won't even give you a pat on the back. -It is unfortunate to witness some individuals burn out quickly because they have to work 10x harder in a single territory as others have 2 or 3x territories with the same quota. 3) Transformation of the AE Role -When I first started, AEs were viewed as ""consultants"" with your clients. Your objective was to thoroughly work with your clients to uncover opportunities, manage the projects, and develop thorough business cases. Most importantly, we were to know our clients' business inside and out. -The AE role has now changed into a business development rep. -Middle management will have you call blitz your clients (which they clients get annoyed with), try to identify an opportunity, then pass it to a co-prime (Pardot, Data.com, Service Cloud, Desk). -The AE no longer works throughout the sales cycle. Management seeks to make the AE role into a transactional based environment -This is upsetting to anyone who enjoys relationship selling. -Many clients are becoming annoyed with the various AEs and Co-Primes continually connecting with them. 4) Quick Wins Now vs. Strategic Larger Deals -Management is so focused on monthly quotas that they will push AEs and clients into decisions before the sales cycle is complete -This could negate larger strategic deals as the client gets a ""band-aid"" fix."
677,"- Politics, politics, politics - Product set dated, especially around process management, analytics/decisioning, big data - Oracle clone - Plenty of little emperors in middle management positions with dillusions of grandeur - Average compensation - Overly reliant on inflated Sales Engineering organisation desperately working to shore up glaring gaps/deficiencies in an increasingly fragmented product set"
795,"Unless you are single and have a lot of free time, I recommend you look elsewhere for jobs. -Team got so large in 2016, what used to be a friendly culture becomes more of less corporate like. -Ex-CEO left, the whole RelateIQ CRM product is getting killed out at some points. -Constantly pivot with fears one day the product is not competitive. -The motto is people, idea, moment and RESULT, yes, result is the only they care regardless of how we achieve it. -Some of the management here are very junior and got converted from early day RelateIQ engineers. With a mindset of moving fast and ridiculously unorganized, this put a whole lot of work on engineers. A lot of LEGACY code that got produced without being thoughtfully planned out. This leads to a lot of hard to trace bugs. -A lot of PM here are super junior who have no clue what's the product development is. This leads to product decision delay, etc. Product planning is totally a joke here. No Scrum of any sort, the process puts a lot of weight on engineer to figure out the problems and solutions. The only thing the PM really does here is to send out email releases when something is about to release. -Lots of young engineers who only care about deliver cool features fast which sacrifices the quality. If you happen to work on a feature last, you are the single point of contact and have to maintain the whole load of it. -Watch out for all the good perks, at some points, when SalesforceIQ is fully melted into Salesforce family, these perks will also go away. Take a look at the Fraiche account, the Lyft credit, the housing stipend, they are all gone. -Don't let the offer congratz email blast from the recruiting and engineering team cloud your judgement. All the things about the family like culture and what's not, this culture is no longer respected. -Some middle managers are control freaks who like to micro manage every of you move. -Every Friday demo is just a hacky thing that squeezes out your extra work and you feel obligated to demo something to the company. -The quarterly Hackday mentality is just another way you work extra hard and late night to produce something really cool."
865,"Political environment Lots of middle management Big enough company for weak performers to find a place to hide, undetected Hiring freezes Over titled and over leveled culture (perhaps for retention)"
1022,"Backstabbing, unnecessarily agressive culture; horribly inept middle management. Rapid hiring without adequate training have left many people working on unnecessary and unproductive projects"
1168,"In the name of taking ownership, the leadership lets the team-members fight it out like dogs for their next project, promotional cycle, bonus, performance-review etc. This is especially true in their CRM Analytics group in San Francisco. The middle management (Senior Managers and Directors) suck with their petty office politics and leadership politics. This whole concept of Hybrid engineers is a big sham and is affecting the quality of their product."
1216,"*Sharp learning curve, you sink or swim *With each acquisition, workload increased while team did not grow at the same rate *Work life balance was very difficult, you are expected to be on all the time *Inexperienced middle management *When something went wrong, little or no management support"
1239,"On the lower end of wages for top companies in the bay area. Middle management seems to be chosen by expediency (timing, willingness) rather than talent in some cases. Company's falling down point is in middle management and lack of rep training. Many new acquisitions and products that reps aren't trained to sell."
2084,- Increasing growth of middle management and more executive leaders without clear roles/responsibilities. - Many teams do the same thing under different names. It's confusing how many teams you need to work with to get something simple accomplished. - Inconsistent leadership - some leaders focus more time on managing-up versus ensuring their people are successful. I've had amazing leaders and mentors but also horrible leaders who marginalize their people. - No clear path for IC career growth. Salesforce gets very political with people garnering for expanded responsibility and headcount - not focused on performance.
2246,"Very fragmented, a lot of sprawl due to many acquisitions. Upper management is top notch. But as you move to middle management, the quality falls off. I wish the generosity for social awareness was mirrored in the work methods. Support for employees as people, but the budget process is same old corporate BS. Salesforce likes to think they are a super progressive employer. This is true for subjects like equal pay for equal work. But the are still too many turf battles between middle managers."
2432,"Others have said it and I wholeheartedly agree. This was the worst professional experience of my career. Learned a lot about how truly horrible a company can treat their employees. Really hard to get a job here unless you know someone and I did--what I didn't know was how much I was lied to with the promise of making a living. The only people who are happy here are the young kids who are striving to achieve success early on in their careers and those who have been at the company for years who are favored and given the good patches to actually make their goal. Such an insidious culture with back stabbing, soul less individuals that starts with the top management and continues through middle management. They are the worst. The Junior VPs who have been there for years, so made it early on but they are worse than the Executive VPs because they really have no talent and have no clue how to manage good people. Turnover rate is ridiculous and the actual number of people who make their goal is so incredibly low. The cube culture ensures that your cold calling (which is mostly what it has become) is heard by your boss so he, and the tenured people around you, can berate you for not moving the deal along. And don't even think about working from home--get there at 7am or you are looked at as a loser for not being committed to the cause. Selfish, manic, loud, seductive people do well here for a while or at least until they slip up and end up with the Dakota patch. Or quit because they can not take it anymore. Drunken culture too which is encouraged by the annual Christmas party which costs millions--it's lavish and luxe--and shameful and gluttonous. I had 3 friends quit for the exact same reasons I did and we look back at the experience unfortunately in the nightmares that still occur for the ""month's end"" because we are not closing squat."
2506,I change managers two times a year. It seems like there are a lot of shuffling within middle management.
2535,"Salesforce is growing rapidly, and as a result is hiring a large volume of unqualified middle management. Additional processes slow down sales cycles."
2559,Great company but becoming too big for it's own good. Some of middle management is not very well qualified but are there by chance - timing. Can have a very Bro culture.
2752,Poor middle management and too much favoritism
2952,"-Lots of middle management are poor at their jobs -Not enough mentoring or knowledge within middle management -Full of politics -Some really shady practices in middle management with managing subordinates, 'mentoring', etc"
3085,"Failure in execution of vision and values at middle management If you're non-sales, you often get left out of company events / initiatives Promotion criteria (if actually issued) not followed consistently Constant expectation to do more with less Silos are everywhere - it's all about who you actually know and have a relationship with in other teams / functions if you want to find out what's happening / get anything done EMEA and APAC teams in support functions are an after thought - everything revolves around HQ and US Don't expect a work / life balance if you live in a time zone more than 2 hours different to San Francisco"

3161,Long working hour Too many middle management
3254,"It's still a big company, so politics, and bloated middle management"
3492,"- Reorg every year. I completed 3.5 years at salesforce and on my 5th manager - Middle management is extremely corrupt and there is favoritism all around. If you do not suck up to middle management, you will not grow at Salesforce - Seniors dating and marrying their direct reports (which explains the favoritism above) - There is no feedback loop for employees to provide their feedback to upper management. It all goes through middle management which is itself corrupt"
3545,"If you are doing work on the Core product, it can be frustrating, as it is a massive Java monolith. I believe there is a culture problem within the management ranks of the Digital Engagement division. SF promotes ""trust"" as their number one core value, but from what I experienced, certain individuals at the middle management level in this division of the company seem to embrace the opposite of that value, leading to an adversarial, rather than cooperative, relationship between teams."
3667,"Due to size and growth, it's very difficult to make an impact in the middle ranks. Politics are hard to navigate. While top leaders (Marc Benioff and Brett Taylor) demonstrate the fun of the culture and sincere dedication to core values, I can't say the same about middle management. A great place to start your career or have a VP or above role."
4359,Total comp packages can lag the market for middle management and below
4425,"As someone whose been with the company many years, it has transitioned from a smaller, agile, product-focused company to a Marketing and Sales holding company that does little or no product development. Nearly every major product announcement over the last few years featured huge fanfare, but resulted in the product dying a quiet end within 2 years. Pretty much every major product announcement now is just a Marketing 're-alignment', rebranding existing products, not actually developing anything new. All innovation is bought, not developed internally, and there is little sign that the various acquisitions (Mule, Tableau, Slack) are actually creating a 2+2=5 effect. It really feels like a bunch of independent companies that are owned by the same conglomerate. The focus on growth by acquisition also means very limited growth opportunities internally since the existing products aren't really growing or innovating significantly, it isn't creating new positions. A new, related phenomenon is that in order to retain talent, many low-to-middle managers are getting 'promotions in place', i.e. they are getting a bigger title and more money without additional responsibility because their orgs aren't growing. So you see lots of VPs with only two directs who are also VPs, creating lots of unnecessary layers of management who all feel they have to micromanage those below them in order to show they are 'adding value'. This lack of organic growth means a lot of people are attritting because they don't see any real career path. Career development isn't a focus beyond the first line of management. After that its all operations, process and programs. Manager success is evaluated on how many programs did you develop and market, not how many employees did you develop or how productive and happy is your team. Another issue is the split between the company image and Sales. While I do think a lot of product and engineering people do really believe in the company values, remember, this is a company founded by a Sales Guy. There is a very cutthroat sales mentality inherited from Oracle that often sees sales reps and leaders blatantly ignore values like trust, equality and customer success in order to hit their quarterly number. Sales is really the #1 value. The large and not rationalized product stack means that often sales reps are pitted against each other because they have overlapping products, and the result can be the customer gets the product of the better rep, not the product they need. Many products are 'zombie' products with no future product development and virtually no support staff, but because there are reps with quota on them, they are still being sold despite the fact that the customer will likely attrit in a couple of years once they realize they've been sold a lemon. Turnover in the Sales org also means a lot of inexperienced account execs who have zero understanding of the products or the company culture but are still being put on big accounts. Over and over you'll hear how solutions teams are the most vital part of the sales organization, but every award, spiff or shoutout goes to the sales rep. You'll hear about some amazing demo that sold the deal but the only names you will here are 5 different reps/AEs, like they did all the work themselves. They'll pat themselves on the back, go off to sales club and collect a massive commission and the SE will get back to work. Another thing most new employees won't notice at first because they just got their nice offer package, is that Salesforce hires at much higher dollar amount than it pays existing employees. Pretty much every new hire will make a LOT more than everyone else on a team. It's joked repeatedly that if you want a raise or promotion, your best option is to leave the company and get re-hired in a year. Stock is incredibly stingy. Unlike most tech companies that do yearly refreshes, you will be lucky to get new RSUs every 3-4 years, even for very top performers. Many relatively senior employees (15+ years overall experience, 4+ with company) have NO stock. A team of 10 might get 2-3 stock refreshes in a year. This is the #1 retention tool, and yet Salesforce consistently lags behind all competitors here. A lot of lip-service is given to the 'giving back' part of the company. When I joined this was for real. You got a week of VTO time, and if you used all that you'd get a sizeable grant to give to a charity of your choice. They removed the grants a few years ago without making any real announcement. The VTO time is still there but if you are above a certain level, you are on 'unlimited' PTO (which means you can take what you want, but only if your manager is cool AND you don't feel guilty about taking off during whatever crisis is currently happening). This makes the VTO time meaningless, since it just gets blurred in with PTO and sick leave."
4590,"- Change management challenges everywhere in the organisation. - Leadership issue with clear accountability and ownership, often too many layers created in the middle management and lack of understand of vision and direction. - Very tactically operate just to meet quarterly result. - Change management happen every fiscal year in my region, the goal and direction from a regional aspect is very fuzzy and keep changing. - Feedback given did not translate properly in the Great leadership methods. - Lack of fun, like it used to be."
4697,"Where do I begin.... *pay is a joke compared to other large SaaS and tech companies. Even if you hit quota, which by the way barely happens. Please, please, please, don’t believe the hype. Less than 20 % of the people hit quota. I think in GRB it’s less than 10% for 2017. Regardless it’s a joke. I’ve worked at other tech companies and I’ve never seem anything so pathetic. *terrible middle management, I mean terrible. Keep in mind this review is coming from someone who was cosidered realtively succssful, and still think this place is a joke. Anyways, I digress.... Middle management for the most part is made up of people who lack leadership skills, talent, experience. It’s actually joke. It’s like a weird cesspool of account executives being promoted to management. One day theyre your peer, the next day, they’re your superior. Not saying they’re racist or anything, but holy hell, talk about 95% Caucasians Being promoted into these roles. Overall, management (based on my experience, observations, talking to peers,etc) literally brings NO value. They just sit at their computer and run reports, show up late to customer meetings, sit awkwardly/quietly in a conference room during a customer call, but during 1on1s (these are also frequent, redundant, waste of time), they offer to sit in on calls/meetings as if They are providing value. If you’re one of the unfortunate suckers/victims to work for Salesforce please please please understand, your entire success, compensation, will be 99% based on the territory handed to you. That’s it point blank. All the other BS, is Just that BS. Run a few reports and you’ll see the top performs get most of their ACV from organic aka gimmes or flips aka warm leads handed to them by the inside biz dev team. Team. Yes, working hard and doing everything the right way (by the book) will give you a very slight edge, but if you’re not handed a fruitful territory you WILL NOT hit quota or make money. Pleeeeasse, please take this as the truth. Again, I was a top 10-20% person, and I’m leaving this review. I could go on and on, but I’ll end it with this. If you’re an experienced sales professional, do NOT work here. You will regret it and regret it fast. If you’re a developer/coder then Salesforce might be a legit landing spot, otherwise look elsewhere."
4730,"- Most of the Pros are company-wide things, but your experience may vary depending on where you work. It is a large company and different areas do things differently. - A ton of middle management and time spent in meetings. - While it is great to be a part of a global company, there are challenges involved in working at a remote location (i.e. not in San Francisco). We are often not a priority when SF is involved, so factoring in the time difference, you can be waiting day(s) to get issues resolved. - As with many companies of this size, a lot of ""hurry up and wait."" Get your work done according to a deadline, but watch it sit due to bureaucracy or changing priorities. - Salesforce isn't immune to a lot of the issues that plague software engineers everywhere. Requirements changing after work has already started, stakeholders not appreciating the complexities of the work, etc."

5553,"Clear disorganization in middle management, lack of clear strategic direction for field organizations, lack of respect for employee work/life balance and lack of strong leadership at the mid-level"
5558,"terrible middle-management, bullying of employees protected by HR, ability to get ahead rests solely on having a corporate ""sponsor"" internally (you get it) , bait and switch on territories, territories always very unequal even though they claim that they are all equal, high turnover has resulted in employees being given $10,000 spiffs this year for all hired sales referals - they claim this is due to growth but it is because AEs are often miserable, given an impossible job with an absurd quota, bullied until they experience physical and mental health problems (see ALL of the other reviews and associated comments posted here - click on the comments after each review, there are dozens or these reports), and then shown the door. you are either part of the ""old school"" crowd here who was with the company pre-IPO so like 5+ years at the company, or you are having a personal relationship with someone in management who is ""taking care of you,"" and then you are given preferential treatment i.e. vacation days not being tracked by your manager, cash-cow best territory year after year, etc. etc. ** OR YOU ARE NOT ** ... in which case you will probably not last here for more than 1-2 years, and probably not that long, because you will be treated poorly, given a territory that Benioff himself couldnt sell into (think rural Indiana and Idaho) and completely miserable. I can't count the # of AEs who fled this place in the 2009 timeframe - dozens. If you are crazy enough to take a job here, be sure you get the exact territory you will be covering written down as part of accepting the job offer - the bait and switch to lure people in here is well-known. You will be promised Chicago and leave your current job, get in the door, take your seat, and be given Louisiana (the boss' girlfriend will end up getting Chicago and no one will remember that you got told you were getting the Windy City - plus the boss' BF probably works in HR so no one to turn to in order to complain). Further, read ALL of the other reviews and comments here on Glassdoor.com - specifically the comments. Again there is a reason this company is giving out 10k referal bonuses to all employees who refer a salesperson who gets hired - and the employee(s) there will tell you how wonderful it is - they're desperate for new people to take the crap jobs so the AEs currently there get the good ones .... and the AEs want the 10k bonus for submitting your resume. They're so greedy for it - its all over LinkedIn constantly. PS - Don't believe the Forbes average salary hype either - that salary figure includes a tiny percentage of Sr. AEs who make $1M plus per year. Countless AEs didnt make jack above their base salary last year - ask about this. And if you get pushed out .... DO NOT LET THEM TALK YOU INTO SIGNING THEIR LEGAL WAIVERS TO PROTECT THEMSELVES"

Often times you need to bring the entire office with you because there is a specialist for different functions (sales, service, cpq, commerce, marketing, oms , analytics, integration, trailhead, ). The frequency that salesforce changes their reps and alignment doesn't tend to sit well with most customers. This has created a struggle to expand, particularly in the enterprise space. Poor alignment between cloud teams for GTM. Most ""generalists"" or ""Account Directors"" are compensated for the efforts of specialists although they don't pull their weight. Many recent reps are fairly green and do not possess the maturity to run a proper sales cycle. Some specialists are running rogue/lone-wolf engagements which can torpedo deals/relationships. Management seems very metric driven, to a fault. Some executive leadership and middle management have no boundaries and will bombard your mobile on weekends. Often times they will assert themselves in your deals and cannibalize any value you've created by offering quarterly discounts to bring them forward."

6273,"Don't expect to impact the software products in a meaningful way while you are there. What you see when you get hired in terms of software coding practices is what you'll be expected to follow. And, unfortunately, there's lots of room for improvement. If you interview here, ask specific technical questions about software best practices and you're likely to get a clever ""non-answer."" A lot of nice talk about what could be done, but nothing specific that translates into actual work quality. While the Salesforce agile approach has all the ingredients a successful team can rely on, the use of those practices is whimsical. The management puts its confidence into junior employees who don't know a thing about building quality software. The middle management is useless on projects. The senior engineers are targets that get poked at ruthlessly. The website products are passable in quality, but the other products like mobile are lame. Lots of false starts and recalled releases from what I saw/heard from those teams. The product vision for the company is unrealistic and egotistical. Management professes that it wants their applications to have an ""addictive"" quality, but they don't even know how to approach that problem. I am glad I'm not there."

Senior management says something and middle mangement does totally opposite * Not compassionate or empathetic. * Poor Employee Success(They should be named as Employer Success) * Talks lot about Ohana, literally everywhere. But it doesn't come in practice. * Says lot about stakeholders. As an important stakeholder, an employee never been valued * Never expect job security. * Poor management decisions with business and no collective thoughts. * Female employees never valued as much as male. Never hired any female employees in most of the organizations. Mostly male dominated organizations. * Lots of serveys happens, but no action will be taken to correct things."

7196,"- company is growing and they put a lot of management layers, in this sense its getting very political - in business development they are working towards operational excellence meaning that there is pretty much no room for own initiative anymore as they come up with the message and the contacts you should reach out to - middle management get promoted quite quick as they company is growing, not always the best people on the right spot."
7511,"Poor middle management, managers need to be trained, sorely lacks diversity although posters show otherwise. Sadly another tech company run by white and Indian men and white women."
7593,lack of middle management training
7691,"Where do I begin.... *pay is a joke compared to other large SaaS and tech companies. Even if you hit quota, which by the way barely happens. Please, please, please, don’t believe the hype. Less than 20 % of the people hit quota. I think in GRB it’s less than 10% for 2017. Regardless it’s a joke. I’ve worked at other tech companies and I’ve never seem anything so pathetic. *terrible middle management, I mean terrible. Keep in mind this review is coming from someone who was cosidered realtively succssful, and still think this place is a joke. Anyways, I digress.... Middle management for the most part is made up of people who lack leadership skills, talent, experience. It’s actually joke. It’s like a weird cesspool of account executives being promoted to management. One day theyre your peer, the next day, they’re your superior. Not saying they’re racist or anything, but holy hell, talk about 95% Caucasians Being promoted into these roles. Overall, management (based on my experience, observations, talking to peers,etc) literally brings NO value. They just sit at their computer and run reports, show up late to customer meetings, sit awkwardly/quietly in a conference room during a customer call, but during 1on1s (these are also frequent, redundant, waste of time), they offer to sit in on calls/meetings as if They are providing value. If you’re one of the unfortunate suckers/victims to work for Salesforce please please please understand, your entire success, compensation, will be 99% based on the territory handed to you. That’s it point blank. All the other BS, is Just that BS. Run a few reports and you’ll see the top performs get most of their ACV from organic aka gimmes or flips aka warm leads handed to them by the inside biz dev team. Team. Yes, working hard and doing everything the right way (by the book) will give you a very slight edge, but if you’re not handed a fruitful territory you WILL NOT hit quota or make money. Pleeeeasse, please take this as the truth. Again, I was a top 10-20% person, and I’m leaving this review. I could go on and on, but I’ll end it with this. If you’re an experienced sales professional, do NOT work here. You will regret it and regret it fast. If you’re a developer/coder then Salesforce might be a legit landing spot, otherwise look elsewhere."
7719,"- Management can be awful and unregulated. Discrimination occurs and they say it wasn’t intentional so it’s okay - Keep your head down and mouth shut. Aim to fly under the radar, and stay middle of the pack. If you over perform you may be punished just as much if not worse than if you under perform - overworked and underpaid. Do not expect work life balance. - Claim they pay hourly including overtime, but management often caps hour submission at a certain level. Therefore, don’t expect to get paid for all the hours you actually work. - don’t anticipate management to help or coach you - culture seems very dependent on your location, rely on culture reviews accordingly. - Big push for monthly quotas, yet told by tenure employees almost 60% of business done in the last quarter. Set expectations wisely."
7726,Political Tenure > Talent Complacent middle management
7851,But middle management spoiling the culture created by top management. Middle management seems to fight with each other for wrong reasons. Company has grown big and the middle management does not know how to handle it. Re-orgs happens without a reason and the new management whoever joins tend to shakes good amount of teams without knowing what they are upto and how it will impact the company and individuals. No clear communication on the changes and re-orgs.
7957,poor middle management cronyism huge culture shift and growing pains; company has become a mini-Oracle haves and have-nots in sales
8139,">> Data people (analysts, scientists, engineers) aren't given enough time or bandwidth by middle management to keep skills up to date. In other words, the best data talent that comes to this company sticks around for a year or two then leaves >> If you are a data person coming to Salesforce ... buckle up and get ready to solve SALESFORCE problems, not data science problems >> Data teams are super siloed and do not work together across orgs. This feels like a huge lost opportunity >> Tech is second to Sales at Salesforce. You aren't on the same pedestal you would be at other FAANG companies >> Data science infrastructure for some teams is surprisingly awful for what is supposed to be a tech company"
8231,No diversity in sales- the website makes the company look diverse and it is not at all unfortunately Poor middle management that plays favorites and favors typical male frat boy. Toxic sales culture of people that constantly undercut one another. No one tries to help new employees and everyone is more concerned with making themselves look better and squeezing others out. So many red accounts and failed implementations!! I’ve never heard of such a thing! Constant change- I had 3 middle managers in one year!
8253,"That being said, the vision and values don't necessarily always translate down to middle management levels. Many orgs (specifically marketing, but I've heard sales as well) are full of politics, mud slinging and power grabs. Senior leadership seems to acknowledge this recently, however there are no consequences for the people that perpetuate this type of environment. Toxic employees who produce results in their job are protected, even when multiple complaints are surfaced through the appropriate channels."
8287,there are few exceptions to above pros in middle management
8372,"Corrupt , fraudulent and political middle management specially crm infra. Highly selfish ,incompetent and greedy. Work for their convenience. Good engineers suffer for the sake of management. Dumbs grow for the sake of management."

9204,"I don't think this review will change anything inside the company, but I hope it will enable people considering to join take a more informed decision. 1] Consider this: They fired several people on the back of the strongest quarter in company's history, that too in the middle of pandemic! Mark promised no layoffs for 3 months, and looked like he was waiting for 3 months to be over. LOL. 2] Unhealthy competition between global teams. US teams typically are more prone to hiding information from other teams across the globe. If you don't know the requirement, you can't build the system, and if you can't build the system, you are labelled as incompetent. (Sr.) Directors/ (Sr.) Managers will NEVER take accountability to gather the necessary information, and delegate all work to ICs (even freshers in some case). Since ICs are ill-equipped to make senior managers or directors in the US to divulge information, they practically get blocked, which results in underperformance discussions for ICs. This brings me to the next important claim by Salesforce - ""Embrace Feedback and Promote Transparency""! 3] I personally know people who would speak up to management (""see something, say something""). Somehow, those were the people who typically got impacted by ""restructuring"". Secondly, all this talk about transparency, and they won't divulge your performance ratings to you. This is the only place this happens. So my question is, if the employee doesn't know how the manager sees their performance, how would they take an informed decision on what next to expect or even challenge that assessment. The performance conversations are always positive from managers, so managers don't need to worry about the internal survey ratings from their team! OH MY, WHAT A MESS. Who's to stop managers from saying you performed awesome, but put a rating of 2 in the backend system? There are more, but I think you would have got an idea by now that the work environment is, at best, extremely toxic inside the sugar coated candy that gets presented to the outside world."
9585,Great company but becoming too big for it's own good. Some of middle management is not very well qualified but are there by chance - timing. Can have a very Bro culture.
9681,"Clear disorganization in middle management, lack of clear strategic direction for field organizations, lack of respect for employee work/life balance and lack of strong leadership at the mid-level"
