6,terrible management very limited space to grow
23,a little higher rotation on upper management.
52,"Too many changes from management, added work for no raise, and average team."
55,"- Onboarding during COVID-19 has been weird and difficult, but they are doing their best given the limitations - There are many meetings. My advice is to always take control of your calendar - RSU refresh is rare from what I hear - Internal move can be difficult, but not impossible with some strategic networking - The senior management still lacks diversity but the company is working on it"
64,management is poor to work
121,decentralized management has its downsides
140,"Big company, sometimes processes are put in place by upper management that don't make sense"
149,decentralized management has its downsides
178,"A little ""fake"" sometimes. Wish there was more authentic communications from management"
197,"Hard to get promoted, can be overwhelming, time management"
206,poor management and yeah just no
232,"Sales - management is not understanding, measured on a monthly basis not quarterly or annually. Hard to move into a new role"
240,~80 hour work weeks are the norm. Constant shifting of priorities creates mountains of technical debt that is never paid down. Teams are not adequately staffed to handle extra load from other members going off on parental leave for months at a time. There is empire building happening at the senior management level that often results in career casualties for the people doing actual work.
248,International management have some tyrants
257,"Some people didn't pull their weight and weren't really called out by management, which could be disappointing, but I guess it's the casein any large company."
268,"Culture in latam, pressure, management in latam"
271,"- Taking into account the cost of living in Dublin the salary is not enough to get by - if you want to be able to live comfortably you should go elsewhere, but if you just want the experience it is worth it - Senior management does not bother communicating well at all with normal staff, it does not make you feel valued at all - Cramped offices, poor selection of snacks"
272,"There is a real lack of cohesion to the sales organization. When you first join you are pretty left to fend for yourself and see to your own integration. The sales targets are completely ridiculous and the compensation plan has been making it more difficult to make money every year. This year I am going to make approximately €25-40k (depending how my year finishes) less than the average of my last two years. The overall attainment figures for sales people are in the toilet. This will not be made clear during your interview and will not be openly discussed with management as to what a realistic quota should be. This ultimately has created a toxic environment where people feel undervalued due to their inability to hit an unrealistic target. In theory, everyone can make good money. In reality 90% of people will miss their target and the majority of commissions will be left in the hands of the few. The increasing product offering of Salesforce brings problems in terms of collaboration. It is not always easy to find the right person for the right meeting in good time. This can make it difficult for customers to do business with us, as the sales process can become protracted. While career options are varied, the criteria for promotion isn't ever clear. It is often a case of 10 people interviewing not knowing how many roles will be filled, not knowing when they will find out and unclear feedback as to why they did/didn't get the role. Naturally this has caused people to question the process."
282,Lots of layers between upper management
284,"Low pay, not enough management levels"
285,Sometimes management have unrealistic expectations
300,"I was with Salesforce for a year. When I started I was made a lot of promises regarding the territories being fair within the team. However, once I got my territory and saw how it was compared to other territories across the team, I realized that 80% of the territories in any given team are bad. Only 20% of the accounts/territories are good and in which the sales people make money. And Management knows this. So if you are an Account Executive aligned well with Management, you are set. However, if you are like the 80% of the account executives, your fate is NOT in your hands as you will get bad accounts. They know this. The management's objective at least in the Toronto office is to only have 20% of the people make their #. They dont want anyone to be 200% of their #. They expect 80% of the reps to miss their #. The territories are extremely disparate. There's a lot of partiality in who gets what accounts. Be very careful when you join as an AE. For other roles like Marketing, Ops etc I've heard its a good place to work. However, for Sales its just like any other company. Dont fall for their lies when they tell you that the territories are fair. To give you a specific example, in the Toronto office there is one person who has 10 president's clubs. He makes a lot of money and his manager and his manager's manager are as expected totally aligned. He is a good rep. However, so are others on the team. However since he has always had the best territory the makes club every single year. Its ridiculous. If you've been in sales for a while, and comes across an environment where ONE person has made club 10 times and every one else has made club 1-2 times in the last 10 years, what would you conclude. The territories are uneven. The management is inept. For example this is the first company that I've come across where the Sales Manager's quota is not aligned with the team. For example in a team of 10 sales reps which a quota of $1M each, the manager doesnt have a $10M quota. His/her quota is way less than that. So even if the team misses their #, the manager makes his/her #. I had never seen that in my sales career. So to get promoted to a manager's role, you need to be connected to the right people. Be very careful in joining this company. For Sales its not as advertised. For other roles it might be different."
308,"Career progression and salary increases are 100% related to the personal brand and not to quantifiable results, this leads people to abuse of the internal social networking platform and any other brown nosing opportunity for self promotion. This may be a plus if you have that attitude, otherwise you will find it frustrating. Due to this, management is represented by some excellent managers and others who are not but have been good in leveraging the above. Salesforce as a family: you are expected to be enthusiastic, participate and promote all sort of social events they serve you. Opting out of something you are not interested in lowers your personal brand. Work-life balance is hard: stressful days masked by great fun on social media, work in the weekend is not uncommon."
317,- Complex management chain - Frequent restructure
329,- Increasing lack of transparency from upper management. - Growth having a negative affect on standards and culture. - Recent introduction of hot desking has turned the office into an impersonal and unwelcoming place to be. It's cost savings at the expense of employees interests. - Uncertainty over future unified office location in Dublin.
330,"Worst management - They will never listen to you. They'll only do what they want to do and all your ideas will be given to others and they are projected as their ideas. Totally biased and even after multiple feedbacks with the proofs they do not want to accept. They will always tell, there's more to come in the future stay tuned. It's not about promotions or hike percentages. It's about ethics and integrity which the management will oversee always. Sometimes it's clearly evident and visible to everyone in the team that something wrong is happening and the local leadership in Hyderabad, never want to fix it. They just want to bypass it saying the (people who get support from management) trying to do something extra why don't you support him instead of giving feedback. Later, the people who actually want to work as a team and share some feedback with the managers will be targeted big time and will be treated as like slaves or even worst them, Support - Worst support that I have seen in the service industry. These guys never understand its a product based support, not a BPO. With Salesforce having three releases a year with all upgradations & patches, it will be difficult for a support person to keep up to date all the time. The worst way of calculation with regards to the headcount. They say they're hiring people but for a quarter 50 people for a backlog and burden of thousands of cases is not working. Outdated metrics are being used to calculate productivity and other year-end calculations. Employee Success or HR: Apart from very few members Zaira Banu & Rajesh I do not see others responding to the questions raised by the employees. I'm not biased towards the above two but however, their work speaks for themselves. Now coming to the recruitment, Salesforce always recommends the employees to refer people to the organisation, however, the recruitment or referral process is worst (there is no other least word for this). I have referred around 10 profiles to this organisation, all the profiles haven't been considered. They stay in the first or second stage for almost 2 to 3 months and then the status changes to No longer in consideration. When we try to contact the recruiter there will be no response. FYI, the above mentioned 10 profiles have been selected in other organisations for better positions and better packages. It's clearly evident on the floor that there is an agreement between the manager and the respective team member. The team member will refer people and the respective manager will select that profile. Once the team member gets the referral bonus it will be shared by the team member(who referred to the profile) and the manager who recruited."
332,"If you like Kool-Aid, have a knack for never questioning things, and don't care much for integrity, this is the place for you! Worst office politics I've experienced - conflicting goals across teams created tension between managers which trickled down to staff. Goal posts were constantly changing and never reaching a resolve. One particular manager was notoriously difficult to work with and had a reputation for bullying, playing favouritism, and making most people feel uncomfortable by employing a management style of intimidation. Despite multiple HR violations against him for his aggressive behaviour, nothing was ever done to rectify it. You're not encouraged to work as a team, but instead, encouraged to develop ways of getting ahead of others through sometimes unethical means. Middle management will overlook any unethical, throwing-under-the-bus behaviours if it means you help them hit their numbers and make them look good. Nurtures a cutthroat environment of arrogance and greed. The company spends far too much energy talking itself up to its employees (#dreamjob) and customers without following through with the goods."
335,"- Hours are long, especially at the end of quarters, occasional weekend required - Occasionally too politically correct - Very sales team focused, all other areas can be made to feel like you are 2nd best to them - Split offices mean that most events and senior management locate themselves in one. As based in the other it can lead to a distant feeling. - My team don't do many events or socialising outside the office, but many others do"
344,Micro management to accommodate for the lowest common denominator. Commission structure means anything less than monthly quota and pay will be poor.
345,Long working hour Too many middle management
353,"Despite not wanting to acknowledge this fact, Salesforce is an incredibly political company to progress in. There is a heavy process around advancement, the main activity being developing your own brand. This involves gaining sponsors at various levels and promoting yourself (sometimes unashamedly) heavily throughout the business. This 'brand campaigning' is by definition political. It is also biased towards those that have the time to commit to it. It is largely dependant on a full and present management chain and those who are actually fully active making a difference at their customers, or who are under resourced and performing multiple roles to serve their customer, do not get the chance to 'seize the opportunity that Salesforce states that it presents. The result is that the talent in the business feel undervalued and the promotions go to the people who have shouted the loudest. It is a real shame, Salesforce isn't the company that I wanted it to be."
357,"I have worked in other companies before and Salesforce seemed great in the beginning but its really the new Oracle in a disguise. * High turnover of staff * Nepotism / 'Boys Club' environment * No transparency * The internal promotion process is questionable * Cheating to hit targets, quid pro quo if you have a network * Management will not listen to feedback (expect that they turn it against you) * Hard to maintain work/life balance * Ohana is just marketing * Micro management * No lunch at all and the breakfast is just cereal * The office location is far away from the centre"
369,"Since the company is growing fast , all sort of people are there in middle management and these people are not following the basic Ohana culture of salesforce which Marc is dreaming about. If you are from an acquired company and not into salesforce tech stack, then be very careful , you will be fired immediately after your knowledge transfer and if they feel that you are no more required to carry on with the work, even though you had spent years together in the acquired company to build the product. No help whatsoever from HR or hiring managers for internal openings even though you learn and get certified in salesforce related technologies."
371,"From the Professional Services Department point of view, there is a lack of opportunities for internal promotions as the management seems to prefer hiring externally most of the time rather than giving a chance to employees that have been developing very hard themselves for the next opportunity; lack of support for professional development with a significant slow down in investing in external trainings and certifications; a lack of transparency towards the consultants that get updated at the last minute about internal changes; quite some room for improvement with regards to resource management as consultants are unclear on what they are meant to be working a week ahead or in terms of priorities and are demanded to do the extra mile every mile; and finally buggy new products that take several years to get almost fixed"
373,"1. If you're hired as ""Success Agent Tier-2"" for CRM support then your Salesforce career is over because you'll be working in a specific skill group (Configuration, Usage or Email team) and do not get any chance to explore the real Salesforce CRM tool. 2. Management do not to monitor/plan their employees leaves(PTO's) properly which again makes very difficult to work with a huge backlog of cases. You can expect 25-30 cases per agent in AMER shift or 30-35 cases per agent in EMEA shift. NOTE: I have worked in Wipro (worst of all IT companies) so I am very well aware of overload/ extra amount of work. 3. They do not have enough ""Tier-3"" resource which makes your life miserable because as Tier-2, you'll be the only point of contact for the customer who has raised a case. If customer escalates the case or gives you DSAT due to the delay in resolution, then it won't affect Tier-3's performance. Management will simply blame you. 4. So many bugs/ Known issues in every major releases which will make you cry like hell as a support agent. 5. If you ask CSG management to hire more resources to reduce the back log, they'll simply say - ""No we cannot because we do not have enough budget"". 6. HR team sends out an employee survey link in each quarter but that doesn't make any change in your work life. 7. Also when it comes to ""Employee referral""(if your friends, relatives or siblings gets hired then you get $2000/each) program in Hyderabad is one of the most ""Corrupted"" program they've. I have seen 3 examples of corruption in referrals where managers referred their siblings who has really good terms with the ""hiring manager"". They all got selected and each manager earned easy $2000 + Family member (as a salesforce employee). So again if you're hired as Success agent Tier-2 then forget about referring anyone. 8. No way you will get Onsite chance. Strict policy. Also please do not dream of getting free passes/visit to Dreamforce event especially if you're in India. ()"
377,"I have seen many reviews but no action yet. We only see the canned response. Biggest mistake by getting employees and management from Call centre culture. 2. Spoiled the work culture. Most of them doesn’t have knowledge or attitude to work in company like Salesforce. They are fit for BPO only. Salesforce values now changed from Trust to No-Trust. Now the culture is Politics, backstabbing, data manipulation. There was saying Getting into Salesforce is harder than getting into Harvard university. This doesn’t apply for Hyd CSG. Criteria for hyd CSG:- 1. Referred by Management 2. Wife can refer husband and vice-versa. True ohana can be seen here. Husband and wife working in same team, shift, and manager. Though we have policy around it, who cares need to focus on Ohana. If not in same team it’s very easy to work in same shift. Doesn’t make sense reaching out to ES as they are the one who gives offer letters. Promotion criteria:- management favourite. Need to know how to play politics. Backstabbing and how to get numbers. Management is afraid to take actions against non performers and people with wrong attitudes which actually spoiled the entire culture. list will go on..."
397,"- Poor work-life balance, it’s all about work. Late night messages and sometimes those bringing call for action for next morning.. And this is getting worse as all management layers feel the need to “contribute”.. - Customer success has changed to customer second; this is confirmed as common view in recent employee survey. It’s all about running the revenue up, on cost of some customers being outright screwed over under time pressure from us. It’s terrible to see this change, having been following this great company for many years. - You get promoted by making your numbers. You can be as disrespectful to Salesforce values as you wish to be, as far as the numbers are on the board. This is not a nice environment to work in. This is a shark tank.. - We are taught to be hustlers. We make stories of how great the prices are in certain month and how my manager has a budget for the extra discounts He would like to spend with you as a special customer. Big news: the discounts are always available for those willing to actually buy and there are no budgets for “special discounts”.. The only big diversion from this is January, when it truly is a buyers market. - It is high pressure, always. - Office is too full, and no home office allowed. - Ohana, trust, customer success - these are just words in Sales slides."
403,"- Completely focuses on sales, nothing else. All that matters to them is hitting quarterly numbers. - High Churn of people due to lack of training, management and high pressured cooker demanding instant results. - Poor leadership in place - often people who have done well put into management positions with no exp or people skills. - Zero career development and growth. - No culture - you will just be another number. - Many people unresponsive and hiding. - Very political and packed with egos. - management seem to ignore and look down on more junior employees as beneath them. - Poor communication to employees."
426,"Political, which is a given with the growth; middle management do not receive training in managing people and are often on power trips (likely based on insecurity); territories are far from equal and the company will double up territories for those they want to promote to make them look good and justify the promotion; too many people eg overlays, excessive levels of management trying to justify why they are employed and create a lot of extra work for AE's; takes away from selling and caring for the customers. Too much 'AE Enablement'...AE's are now Customer Success, Technical Support, Operations, Sales Engineers as instead of hiring resources, everyone wants to train AE's to do their job...not a good use of high paid employees and takes away from productivity and revenue driving activities. As AE's you are pretty much seen as a number and stat to 'stay in the box' without a lot of autonomy on how to spend your day. Lots of burnout if you get sucked into the monthly 'life or death' culture to meet quota or be ashamed."
432,The UK SE management team are experts in killing talents and disregarding industry experience. Every SE manager has been given a quota to hire and promote certain number of women and young people and they are so single minded that they completely brush aside some of their top talents . Their strategic & top SEs are the most unsung heroes and instead everyone keep singing the praise of the grads which is such a short sighted view and in a long run they are going to lose their top performers .
445,"Very very very few. Small signs of getting too big, slower decision making. In some cases too much committee management"
448,"While working at salesforce, I got the sense that management knows the right thing to say, but ultimately doesn't act in a way that's consistent with their message. For example, there's a huge emphasis on employee growth but it seems more attention is spent retaining ""old guard"" than giving other staff opportunities to grow. And despite appearing on ""best employers"" lists, the hours are pretty hard and the equity package (RSUs/options) is one of the worst in the Valley."
479,"Can be very exhaustive to keep up. Change is the new constant, so you are always learning and re-learning. Easy to get distracted as there are many events and charities you are encouraged to be a part of. At end of day, you are responsible for your own KPIs, so time management is essential"
485,Pains and politics from growing fast. Flat management structure makes it challenging to understand career path in the company. Products and platforms and their nomenclature are constantly changing which can be a challenge to keep up and stay aligned and then communicate effectively to the customer sometimes.
491,"We work way too much. It's not necessarily that there's management pressure for it, but we just feel passionate about the company and our work, so we end up working all the time. It takes conscious personal and management efforts to ensure we stick to not working, evenings, on weekends and holidays."
500,"Mediocre management in Indian operations ( not Hyderabad ), Indian Sales Team. Local leadership( across levels and businesses) politics and attitude"
502,Middle management is not good
543,"Dashboards for everything, no clear processes, lack of serious in management, a lot of favoritism - no HR representant"
546,- Brainwashed culture exists using Orwellian terminology like #dreamjob and Employee Success for HR - High school fist bumping mentality - Constant hypocrisy from the predominantly Caucasian management team who preach about diversity.
553,"The company is growing very rapidly, still because of the management issue employees has to suffer"
575,"In such a big company getting yourself noticed can be difficult. Also, there is a lot of ""process"" to follow for little reward apart from what management sees."
592,"Very fast growing company, a lot of movement within teams and across management. Good in the way that it produces a lot of opportunity for promotion but also challenging in terms of maintaining momentum and team dynamics."
599,Business geographic focus imbalance. Growth management weakness.
613,salary banding. aggresive management and no everyhing is ' joined up'
619,Young management in Sales Development. Out grown the office space. Less competition over internal talent. Allow the employee to choose the career path they want.
630,"Too much middle management, and false titles. Company vision and direction are constantly changing. Some promotions are caused by political reasons, rather than having the best candidate for the job selected."
636,No more start up culture. Politics politics politics in upper management level. They don't know Cloud and CRM. What a shame...
673,"ORACLE 2.0 -This terminology has been tossed around a lot thorough out these reviews. I view the Oracle effect on Salesforce through the following: 1) Middle Management -This is probably the worst part of Salesforce. These ""managers"" have been placed into these positions as the company grew too quickly. Salesforce will take Account Executives and place them into management positions without previous coaching/mentor experience -As a result, many (not all) of these managers will bastardize AEs. They are very quick to through AEs under the bus to save their image. -These managers have no skills at coaching, helping, or mentoring. -I have personally been involved in one-on-one meetings where I have experienced a manager insulting myself and my work. I have witnessed AEs quit after one-on-one meetings as their manager pushed them beyond limits. -I have also witnessed managers insult clients. If the client ""pushes a deal"" outside of the month it is forecasted, managers will become overly aggressive with the client to pull it back. Sometimes this tactic works, but it upsets the client and destroys future relationships. -Middle management will pick their favourite AEs and provide everything possible to ensure their success. 1.5, 2, 3x territories. Providing the best territories to their favourites. -I left Salesforce as my manager was insulting, rude, aggressive, upsetting to clients, and deceiving. They were not a coach, mentor, or visionary. 2) Territory Management -As stated in the Middle Management section, some AEs will get 1.5, 2, or 3x the territories -Management will tell you that each territory is cut evenly (laughable). So if an individual has 2x territories, they should have enough business to close 2x monthly quota -Even though these lucky AEs have double the territories, your monthly quota is equal to theirs -If these lucky individuals sell 50% of plan in each territory (making up 100%) and you hit 98% of your plan, middle management will act like these individuals are the next Glengarry Glen Ross. Middle Management won't even give you a pat on the back. -It is unfortunate to witness some individuals burn out quickly because they have to work 10x harder in a single territory as others have 2 or 3x territories with the same quota. 3) Transformation of the AE Role -When I first started, AEs were viewed as ""consultants"" with your clients. Your objective was to thoroughly work with your clients to uncover opportunities, manage the projects, and develop thorough business cases. Most importantly, we were to know our clients' business inside and out. -The AE role has now changed into a business development rep. -Middle management will have you call blitz your clients (which they clients get annoyed with), try to identify an opportunity, then pass it to a co-prime (Pardot, Data.com, Service Cloud, Desk). -The AE no longer works throughout the sales cycle. Management seeks to make the AE role into a transactional based environment -This is upsetting to anyone who enjoys relationship selling. -Many clients are becoming annoyed with the various AEs and Co-Primes continually connecting with them. 4) Quick Wins Now vs. Strategic Larger Deals -Management is so focused on monthly quotas that they will push AEs and clients into decisions before the sales cycle is complete -This could negate larger strategic deals as the client gets a ""band-aid"" fix."
677,"- Politics, politics, politics - Product set dated, especially around process management, analytics/decisioning, big data - Oracle clone - Plenty of little emperors in middle management positions with dillusions of grandeur - Average compensation - Overly reliant on inflated Sales Engineering organisation desperately working to shore up glaring gaps/deficiencies in an increasingly fragmented product set"
683,Oracle 2.0 Over inflated characters who spend most of their time preening their egos Vicious political infighting Revolving door management
686,"no management, no team spirit, no real strategy on sales patch and target distribution, carreer process for sales is all about network..."
693,Lots of layers of management consisting of managers that could only ever survive in a large corporate structure. Lots of egos although that is to be expected from a sales organisation.
696,One of the sad part was that our concerns which we use to highlight was never use to reach to our higher managers Favor-ism was one of the thing which I witnessed because of which other folks used to slog Job stability is a concern because due to there changes in the higher management they can ask you leave at anytime Also I felt that few people where not competent enough to be a part of the organization not sure how they got hired.
705,"Management come from the larger company, but these companies don't grow. They don't have a management experience of growing company."
709,- Lack of management - Lack of leadership - Poor onboarding process - Success only measured and valued by money
717,"Pay below comparable jobs at other companies High school football captain culture Lack of talent at higher management level (great politicians, often not competent) Work life balance CEO personality cult"
762,"hours, job opportunities, management, constant change"
763,"Crazy turnover Very few achieve quota (and therefore make very little money) - I'm well over my #, but am the exception Sales management micro management and expectations Very little product enablement for customers, support is struggling, revolving door with accounts means everyone has a short term focus (sell it all now, let someone else deal w/ the aftermath)"
771,"Extremely short staffed, meaning workload is immense and the metrics pressure is insanely stupid putting undeserved pressure on employees. Upper management is completely clueless about anything that doesn't appear on their dashboard."
783,"- Majority don't truly care - Too much emphasis on process that it becomes an overhead for those who want to get the job done - No sense of loyalty or mechanism in place for career development, you are on your own - A lot of it is show business - very poor management"
795,"Unless you are single and have a lot of free time, I recommend you look elsewhere for jobs. -Team got so large in 2016, what used to be a friendly culture becomes more of less corporate like. -Ex-CEO left, the whole RelateIQ CRM product is getting killed out at some points. -Constantly pivot with fears one day the product is not competitive. -The motto is people, idea, moment and RESULT, yes, result is the only they care regardless of how we achieve it. -Some of the management here are very junior and got converted from early day RelateIQ engineers. With a mindset of moving fast and ridiculously unorganized, this put a whole lot of work on engineers. A lot of LEGACY code that got produced without being thoughtfully planned out. This leads to a lot of hard to trace bugs. -A lot of PM here are super junior who have no clue what's the product development is. This leads to product decision delay, etc. Product planning is totally a joke here. No Scrum of any sort, the process puts a lot of weight on engineer to figure out the problems and solutions. The only thing the PM really does here is to send out email releases when something is about to release. -Lots of young engineers who only care about deliver cool features fast which sacrifices the quality. If you happen to work on a feature last, you are the single point of contact and have to maintain the whole load of it. -Watch out for all the good perks, at some points, when SalesforceIQ is fully melted into Salesforce family, these perks will also go away. Take a look at the Fraiche account, the Lyft credit, the housing stipend, they are all gone. -Don't let the offer congratz email blast from the recruiting and engineering team cloud your judgement. All the things about the family like culture and what's not, this culture is no longer respected. -Some middle managers are control freaks who like to micro manage every of you move. -Every Friday demo is just a hacky thing that squeezes out your extra work and you feel obligated to demo something to the company. -The quarterly Hackday mentality is just another way you work extra hard and late night to produce something really cool."
808,some teams are very archaic and hard to innovate. Soft and sometimes ineffective management
851,"Lots of change during times of massive growth can be challenging, lack of exposure of senior management to customers."
865,"Political environment Lots of middle management Big enough company for weak performers to find a place to hide, undetected Hiring freezes Over titled and over leveled culture (perhaps for retention)"
867,"Employees overworked, bad departmental management"
908,Growing the army was such a concern they often hired the wrong types for management. I loved my peers but managers seemed under qualified.
913,Management can be sometimes very unprofessional Integrity issues Too snobbish. Consider themselves the GODS of SaaS. A little away from reality. Micro-management and Bureaucratic Growth opportunities have been on a decline lately
918,"Dependency management and integrated planning is cumbersome and just plain hard in a distributed agile environment. We don't focus enough energy on making sure we do it right. Growing so fast, it is hard to keep the culture where we want it."
924,"- If you come from an acquisition, Salesforce isn’t going to pay you as well as they pay their internal employees. Even if you are doing the same exact job as someone inside Salesforce, you will probably be making significantly less than what a core employee will be making. It was extremely frustrating and completely demeaning to hear all the hype and news about how Salesforce employees are so happy with their compensation and how Salesforce is making strides towards equal pay. Apparently, acquired company employees are not part of that equation and we do not hold as much value and shouldn’t be treated as equals…ridiculous. I asked for a compensation change in order to match or even come close to the pay of my peers within the Salesforce organization but was told that Salesforce does not have enough internal data to justify a compensation change. Essentially, there was no proof at Salesforce that I was worth a compensation change. This blew my mind because when you first hire someone, you have no proof internally that they are worth the salary that you are going to pay them. What you do instead is evaluate their past experiences and then you determine what is fair pay based on their experiences, skills, and the job that they are doing. You have no internal data or proof in that situation. If you acquire a company, yes, you have no Salesforce data to prove that an employee is worth a certain salary but you acquired a product that you clearly thought had value and the people who helped to create that product are not worth a compensation change because you don't have enough data? I had been working for the acquired company for almost a year, but all of that was meaningless because if you're acquired, it seems like you're not truly a ""Salesforce employee"" and being paid fairly is not something that applies to you. - Our entire acquisition process was a complete mess. My team and I essentially had to operate “as normal” which was completely impossible given that all of our management and the rest of the company were trying to figure out the acquisition themselves. We were lost in the transition, did not have managers for quite some time, and were essentially left to fend for ourselves for the better part of 4 months. It didn’t seem like the M&A team knew what to do with us and had forgotten we existed. - During the acquisition process, we were told that there would be tons of opportunities within the Salesforce organization but once we were in the Salesforce organization, in reality, there were no opportunities. We contacted departments and teams we were interested in and were repeatedly told that they were not hiring or that you needed XYZ experiences that none of us had. We had no choice in what department or role we were assigned. A role was thrown on us, whether we liked it or not, with no other presented opportunities. - My team and I were expected to hit ridiculous numbers as soon as we were acquired despite the fact that we were not fully integrated, did not receive the goal numbers until halfway through a quarter, and still had to facilitate the entire merging of all our systems with Salesforce's systems. We received very little support from the core Salesforce organization and were treated as if we were incompetent because we could not hit these numbers. It seemed like my team and I were being set up for failure so that the core team had a reason to get rid of us once we did not hit a specific goal."
947,Still looking for real cons. It could be easy to get overwhelmed by all the technology and communication. There are lots of volunteering opportunities and making time to participate requires good time management
948,"-Terrible customer service-- Unless client pays for premium customer service, we can't help them (and even then we have to pass them onto a rep in another country); -Huge company with an even bigger ego. If you worked anywhere else, it's nothing compared to SF. You're lucky to work there and they don't value any of the reps opinions. If you were a senior level salesperson elsewhere, prepare to take at least two steps back. -Quota is unrealistic and management knows it. The best reps hit quota once a quarter typically. -Overworked: scolded if you don't answer calls and emails on weekends. -Benefits aren't always what they seem. Try to take full amount of paternity leave and you'll be told by management that, ""No one really takes that long for paternity leave. You can come back in a few days or else your job won't be here."" -Never able to take days off at end of months or the entire last month of a quarter."
964,"There's a learning curve to trying to not become too corporate, but at the same time 19,000+ employees globally. Occasionally I feel that we are very top heavy management wise."
968,"While SF tries to maintain the Ohana culture, the reality is it's still a very large company. Hard to not feel like a ""number"". Also, while they provide a large amount of PTO (even unlimited for management), it's next to impossible to take even a day completely off. People are working constantly."
976,"Lack of process, planning is poor in some areas. Some people in management believe that we are still a startup, which can be limiting. Staffing is lean and staff are very, very busy!"
977,Company only understands direct sales and has not embraced and invested in indirect sales channels. Senior management of indirect sales has no experience or background. Consistently under invest and make short sighted decisions.
992,"I wouldn't tell even my worst enemy to go to work for Salesforce after the experience I have had. It's a huge company that cares very little for lower-level employees. Don't expect to transfer departments or move to a better job no matter how hard you work. You will be subject to the whims of upper management.. The company has also recently changed its volunteer time off policy to turn it into a weird sort of competition, so there's no longer a guarantee that you will receive a grant to donate to the charity of your choice if you complete your volunteer hours for the year. Everything about this company is horrible and the direction it is headed is wrong in so many ways."
1016,"the management stinks, lot's of 1-2 year managers that offer no value. It's all about metrics and pipeline generation, less that 20% will achieve their number, it's all about luck and nepotism. If you've made money in your career and want to continue making money, keep looking, most sales reps leave in >2 years. I hated working for Salesforce, too many ego's and you will spend way to much time on selling internally and appeasing others."
1019,Worst life / work balance situation imaginable - and Sr Management does not care Only one raise in last 4 years Everyone is afraid to tell management the truth - Sr Management is extremely vindictive HR Dept offers no help to current employees People in the field are second class citizens to people at HQ
1022,"Backstabbing, unnecessarily agressive culture; horribly inept middle management. Rapid hiring without adequate training have left many people working on unnecessary and unproductive projects"
1031,"The workforce is not very diverse and the environment is all about doing what it takes to launch product without any thought to employee burn out. No work/life balance & their work from home policy is also misleading. Layers and layers of politics beyond anything you will ever experience (& I've worked for some large corporations but nothing like SFDC)! More often then not, people get promoted based on popularity & not on merit. Internal opportunities are few as they would rather backfill from outside rather than consider developing an internal candidate. I'm surprised at the number of people that say this company cares about their people as all the depts I've worked with including my own often referred to having a ""thankless job"" and the sentiment seemed consistent everywhere I went - the only exceptions are the employees that are fairly new to the company. I am a firm believer in giving back which is why volunteerism was an important criteria for me when seeking out employees. I was so disappointed to discover that my management saw volunteer hours as a game - ""log your hours and volunteer so we can beat the other dept....I will be checking hours by the end of the week"" This is disturbing!"
1048,"Salesforce produces Entitled and quite frankly, arrogant people. They tell you to pat yourself on the back because ""its harder to get into Salesforce than Harvard""... people repeat this at bootcamp, when they didn't even attend Harvard. Training is all online Trailhead badges, and not personal training with objection handling, interaction and just a bunch of ""Salesforce is the best and the competitor sucks"", their management and team breeds arrogance, ignorance and lack of humanity. Salesforce is all smoke and mirrors, great place to work, but their sales teams all stab eachother in the back. Try asking people about the relationships between EMEA and NorthAmerica on accounts. They claim #1 place to work but ask around, people get sick of being a cog in the corporate system. Salesforce is great marketers but peel back the onion, on integrating the clouds."
1052,"Upper management can sometimes become mismanaged, causing miscommunications down the line"
1064,"Salesforce has aggressive growth targets, which are crucial to success and maintaining market leadership; however, management isn't properly equipped to handle the pressure from above and translate that message in a way that motivates employees."
1070,Sales is a grind with lots of micro-managing and overwhelming asks from management
1073,"-Catered lunches/dinners means it's easy to gain weight. -Since we are are still pretty young, the upper management is composed of mainly people who were here at the beginning. This means they can be a mixed bag in terms of actual competence/managerial ability."
1079,"It's getting very political with the change of the guard to a more Oracle centric management team. Territories are thinly sliced and watered down unless you're in the good graces of your manager or the most senior person on your team, and if you're stuck with a bad one someone has to leave or get promoted for you to get a bigger slice. Work life balance is so/so...each manager determines if you can work from home with no real ""program"". Base salaries are below average in the industry."
1094,terrible location to commute to. we came through a buy out. first year was good. second year was bad. All top people of my startup were forced out after less then 2 years. we were given crap tasks to do after a year with tons of politics and terrible management. Management changes by the minute.
1108,"What happens when a the World's Most Innovative Company hires almost exclusively from a company that doesn't even crack the top 100? The culture changes. We become less innovative, more hierarchical, less transparent, less appreciative. It is well known: if you want to move into management, the best way is to leave and come back. Diversity is a good thing, including diversity of experience."
1111,"Salesforce allows people to manage that have no previous management experience therefore do not know how to coach and help team members advance in their own careers. When an associate isn't a good fit for a role or team based on how biased they feel in a group of ""bros"" (manager included), there needs to be a better avenue for letting said associate explore other opportunities within the organization instead of immediately being fired without a good reason."
1148,"Some growing pains but they recognize and act upon it quickly, rather than blaming employees Employees work hard here, yet management emphasizes wellness to avoid burnout"
1162,"inflexible work schedule and not a great work life balance,High level of micromanagement and lot of push on transactional cycles"
1168,"In the name of taking ownership, the leadership lets the team-members fight it out like dogs for their next project, promotional cycle, bonus, performance-review etc. This is especially true in their CRM Analytics group in San Francisco. The middle management (Senior Managers and Directors) suck with their petty office politics and leadership politics. This whole concept of Hybrid engineers is a big sham and is affecting the quality of their product."
1170,"You basically work in a sweatshop as an AE. I’d honestly love know who they are interviewing and how Salesforce is winning “best company to work for” because it’s definitely not the sales team. Quotas are completely impossible to hit. I had a 1.1 million dollar quota for a territory that made $200,000 TOTAL the year before. You tell me how that adds up?! On top of that, I was putting in 11-12 hour work days (which is encouraged, might I add) and only making 3% commission on every deal I closed even though I grew my little territory over 80%. You make no money here, you are not compensated fairly and when brought up to management they sweep it under the rug and deflect. Management and leadership plays favorites and gives larger, More tech savvy territories to AEs who are not skilled but rather, who they party with. Yet we all have the same quotas (unless you actually have a lower quota bc you’re a favorite too)."
1179,"Favoritism by management. Accounts are hand selected so that favorites make their number while others are given ""whitespace"" accounts that don't buy. Marketing cloud is selling while service cloud is floundering."
1180,If your not on Core/Running the account strategy then your an overlay sales person for one of the recently acquired applications. 1) You can't control your own number 2) Your management runs you buy a spreadsheet
1183,"Do what you can to not work in the Salt Lake City office. They're a newly acquired (2017) company and still stuck in the 'small company' mindset. Work/Life Balance won't be possible, in my opinion, at newly acquired companies without a backbone as they will try to appease upper management they've never met by asking their teams to complete impossible tasks."
1216,"*Sharp learning curve, you sink or swim *With each acquisition, workload increased while team did not grow at the same rate *Work life balance was very difficult, you are expected to be on all the time *Inexperienced middle management *When something went wrong, little or no management support"
1239,"On the lower end of wages for top companies in the bay area. Middle management seems to be chosen by expediency (timing, willingness) rather than talent in some cases. Company's falling down point is in middle management and lack of rep training. Many new acquisitions and products that reps aren't trained to sell."
1246,"Teams feel disconnected, there is not much communication between management and employees. Also notice that it's hard to chart a career course here."
1279,"Monthly cadence can be tough to keep up with, but management works with you to align with personal & professional goals to overcome the hustle."
1323,Average Compensation and Perks. Big company like management.
1338,- fast growing and then maybe sometimes a bit too much internal politic and micro management
1341,"This is not the place for people who are not willing to work hard and with full commitment and enthusiasm. Sometimes keeping the work/life balance is a bit hard, but management is fully supporting in trying to get it right"
1395,not sure higher management lives those values and forget the Ohana in tough times.
1399,"micromanagement, lot of pressure, no leadership"
1401,"- The Ohana culture is just for show to public especially in the Singapore office. - Management focus is only on short term sales result, doesn’t care about customer success. - Need politics to get ahead. Need to be close to the inner circle of power. - Managers are not leaders, finger pointing culture, micromanagement, inability to retain good talents and humiliation of AEs in public forums."
1409,bad decision making management. Can do better with inclusion
1438,"- Its all about territory and timing. Everyone says it... except for management. In 2019, only two AE's hit their number. Everyone else told and I quote ""either not up to it or not working hard enough"". The third alternative being the model isn't set up right and they have over hired AE's, but leadership tone deaf to that alternative. - Not a place to earn money as an AE unless you get one of the performing territories - There is no in country marketing resources leaning on reps to run events and drive awareness - Product over priced and NZ leadership team not armed with the ammunition to compete against Hubspot who were doing ""COVID"" deals and giving 90% off in first year - Career progression limited - Brain washing is real - New rep measures are always being introduced and feels like big brother is always watching - no consistency and the line is always moving/complicated. In the end you give up caring and focus on the old tried and tested (pipegen + closed ACV)."
1452,"Hard to say, several management questionable"
1480,"- fast,changing, challenging (positive competition) - endless meetings and call ( management resort to send official email refrain conducting business related meeting on Friday.Digital detox)"

1486,"Information overload. Having an already impressive world of solutions, with new updates, apps, integrations, or products coming up every month, is almost impossible to stay on track about all you should know. The resources are limitless and helpful but you can get lost in a huge ocean of data that can lead to a little bit of desperation. Easy to fall in an only work mindset life, and it will be your fault, not the company's. Moving into Dublin (not the most exciting and cheap city in the world) for a job will already tell enough about you. This is a demanding job with a lot of freedom and perks from the company (the company and the management are the number 1 rest, holiday and work/life balance importance praisers) but if you want to do a good job and perform as you are coming here to, expect to work very long hours and days, especially in the beginning. Don't expect to be a free bird as you used to be, probably never. Targets are ambitious and so is your compensation and benefits, so expect to be tied tight and monitored on a very regular basis. With the working from home, it has been more accentuated that some might confuse it with micromanagement. Never is enough. Like any other sales company in the world, no matter how much you sell or work, you can always be asked to do little more. Take ownership of your pipeline and expect not to get the foot out of the gas pedal until the holidays break, no matter at which number you at. The party is almost over. If you are coming from an startup, you should see Salesforce as that older brother that used to be in all of the parties getting into its mid 30's. He knows what the fun is about but is now switching into a more responsible lifestyle and will only join those parties once a month let's say."
1504,- you live and die by your territory and AE’s - management does not take this into consideration
1508,"JP office is extremely domestic, and does not have the drive, momentum or speed which other international tech firms or a typical foreign sub company has as a working culture. Since the majority of the people in the back office has been working here for a very long time (which is a good thing in one way), many of them are not use to changes - rather prefer to stick to the norm. Ohana is one of the key culture (which is a great conceptually) in Salesforce. But in JP back office, this is recognized in a different/miss leading manner. More specifically, it's been recognized as ""protection"", rather than supporting and challenging each other for growth. This shows up as lack of ownership, professionalism and extremely conservative working style/attitude. If you try to challenge someone, you're taken in a different way. Since there's really no culture of challenging each other, it's taken very offensively --- that's still fine but the most shocking part is, senior management doesn't notice or understand anymore of the benefits of growth via challenges and constructive communication. This is one of the most disappointing aspects of this office where it doesn't show to the outer world --- I have seen another review saying ""a master of disguise"" and completely understand what it means. When joining, do not expect a high paced, competitive working style lead by professionals with strong ownership --- but rather expect a conservative environment, hence for those who are looking for growth via challenges, constructive communication and data driven decision makings, this may not be the best place for you. Money is good, but growth wise, not able to recommend."
1544,Navigate political management Slow promotion cycles
1565,"none really, management, wages, holidays"
1600,Pathetic management No work life balance
1601,"Success completely depends on territory and timing. You'll be assigned an install base which is where most reps get their ACV from (this is why Salesforce acquires so much tech so they can keep customers within their ecosystem and sell them new products). If you don't have an install that is ready to buy this will impact your overall performance. Flips and inbounds will also play a big factor, depending which market you're in will ultimately determine your end results. Anyone outside of Sydney or Melbourne good luck! Also ensure that you have solid relationships with management, like most big companies there is some unconscious levels of favoritism."
1670,- not many lawyers for lots of sales staff - overworked - lack of management directions - not much variety
1676,Some management focus on technical side with no time for people management
1709,Getting harder to earn significant money now Lots of management layers now Complex set of products
1753,"Not as such, everything is best right from the work to management"
1791,Time management and balancing work and admin time can be a challenge
1805,"No support from HR, managers etc they ask you for feedback that they know you can’t be 100% honest about and then blame you for not telling them once you burn out They don’t listen to the surveys we take about our managers or the company Employees are just numbers and ACV. “You are here to learn” fail once and see what happens Hypocritical behavior from people who wish to empower you, in the end they only talk the talk. Fake political positions, the CEO earns 20m a year, if he was concerned about the earth, poverty etc he would spare some for others. (Many other examples) Women are always preferred to management director positions solely because they are women and not based on their competences Team spirit is inexistant, people won’t hesitate to shame you to their manager and steal deals off you. Toxic environment"
1852,"Ohana culture is really fading away because ASEAN Sales management is so number-driven and sales-focused. Sales culture is pretty toxic where you are pushed for numbers on a weekly, daily basis. Micro-management exists under some management but feedback are not welcome because they always pushed things back as your own problems. Had several burnouts in a months and they make you feel like a bad salesperson and lower self-confidence. Everybody in sales is looking for new opportunities and turnover rate has been crazy because of recent management changes."
1930,"Big disconnect from management especially at the higher levels, information is slow to disseminate, problematic change management"
1931,"Upper management are sales people and they try to manage the technical teams like sales, doesn't work well."
1937,- micro management - unhealthy work environment - much of what's touted about a great work environment does not funnel down to sites away from HQ - mid-level mgmt creates a toxic culture that is very stressful & unhealthy
1949,Lots and lots of stress Micromanagement environment You will feel drained as an SDR
1967,Very high metrics to hit and a lot of people management
1976,"Finance department has some growing pains. Pretty sub-par culture with a bug lack of management on work load, project management, and more. Work-life balance out the window here. A big piece of the org is great, but there's some employees who haven't figured out a good management style to the detriment of the team"
1985,"With some 60,000 employees, my opinions are just what I see and experience in my little piece of Salesforce. Different areas of Salesforce may have different management styles."
2009,-Hard to network virtually -Must practice great time management skills
2017,- slow as molasses - immature peers and management
2019,Competitive roles create a competitive work environment Growing pains as business grows; systems and orgs take time to adjust Slight disconnect from management and leadership levels creates issues with top down designs and decisions.
2057,Executive management has been a revolving door for the past 4 years. COVID was the first 'disruption' that the company has ever seen and it showed. Immature mgmt (meaning they had not seen adversity in the market/economy before) so they did not know how to best steer.
2084,- Increasing growth of middle management and more executive leaders without clear roles/responsibilities. - Many teams do the same thing under different names. It's confusing how many teams you need to work with to get something simple accomplished. - Inconsistent leadership - some leaders focus more time on managing-up versus ensuring their people are successful. I've had amazing leaders and mentors but also horrible leaders who marginalize their people. - No clear path for IC career growth. Salesforce gets very political with people garnering for expanded responsibility and headcount - not focused on performance.
2122,"The push for productivity on top of enormous amount of learning material pushed on people here is unrealistic and stress inducing. During the pandemic more work was given than less. Getting a promotion requires you to push numbers rather than do work that benefits the team. All of the number fibbers and cherry pickers are the ones getting the back rubs here. Work/life balance is not respected all that much. It's stated that you should strive for a work/life balance, but the amount of work given does not allow it, and you'll usually find yourself frantically looking for extra time to fulfill work that's been unrealistically dumped on you. KPIs are unrealistic given the extension of some issues that customers raise. Upper management makes quick uneducated changes that usually goes against what everyone in the org would recommend, but they do it anyways."
2149,"During my time here, I've witnessed countless examples of discrimination and inappropriate comments from management, specifically my manager. This behavior is accepted. Salesforce is not a company that welcomes open, honest dialogue and feedback. If you disagree with management in any way, expect retaliation. There are people in management positions who have no business being there. When you have questionable leadership, it causes many issues and problems that go unnoticed. In my case, I was subjected to report to someone who lacks the basic qualities a good manager must have: empathy, understanding, active listening, patience, strong communication, transparency, and loyalty to your team. Don't expect any of those qualities in many of the managers at Salesforce. The managers here continue to ""kick down and kiss up"" to get to where they are today. My manager lacked maturity, basic professionalism, and self-awareness . He has said some derogatory things about women, made incredibly inappropriate comments on team calls, and speaks to some of the females on his team in such a brash, disrespectful manner. It did not help that the person he reported to, the next manager in the line of management, was inherently cold and disconnected. I have never seen such self-serving managers in my professional career. The recruiting managers and leaders will never have your back. Example: If a candidate feels as though he/she should have gotten a job they interviewed for and chooses to retaliate against the recruiter ( example: write a bad Glassdoor review and name you), recruiting leadership will reach to place blame on the recruiter. Bad Glassdoor review = bad for the brand and the ""brand"" is #1 priority at Salesforce. EVERYTHING that is done at this company is done as an effort to strengthen their brand. It's all for show. All they care about is being perceived as ""a company that cares"" with an ""Ohana"" culture, when in reality, it is all about optics and concealing an incredibly abusive, toxic culture. Be prepared to also have a manager that takes credit for your success. You did well because they ""set you up for it"" and ""coached you."" (During my entire time there, I have never learned anything valuable from my first line manager - with the exception of what kind of manager I will not be one day) Recruiting here is a factory. It's all about pumping out hires quarter after quarter and hitting an arbitrary hiring number at any expense, even if you have to bend the rules a bit. Example: having people have start dates when they're still employed at their current employer, pressuring sales candidates to start immediately without giving a notice period to their current employers and using manipulative tactics like saying ""If they really want this job, they will make it happen""...etc. Salesforce hires most - if not all - recruiters on contract first. They reassure you that the contract thing is just a Salesforce formality and should you be a perform well, you will be converted in a year or less. I saw first-hand a couple of very high-performing recruiters get let go simply because they refused to play the ridiculous political game that is expected of you. Recruiting here is a rat race and lacks any nuance or creativity. As a recruiter, you do not have a voice or opinion. You are a sheep in the herd following the leaders. The ""leaders"" only care about branding, how the company is perceived, and how they themselves look to their leaders. They care very little about the actual recruiters doing the work. Recruiters are at the very bottom of the totem pole. If you hint at any disscontempt with your role, team, manager, company - you will be shunned. I can't speak for all of the recruiting teams and the entire company, but this is my honest feedback about Sales Recruiting at Salesforce. I wanted to provide honest feedback to future candidates who are considering leaving full-time roles for this often unpleasant role. If you choose to, use this as a resume booster if you're trying to break into the tech industry and then get out. Understand that the behavior you will witness there and the treatment you will likely receive is not okay. This is not how respectable companies operate. There are so many better opportunities at other SaaS companies where you will be treated with dignity and respect."
2155,Onboarding experience needs improvement although I didn’t get the chance to attend in person boot camps. Each group needs to create content so employees are aware of their division practices and resources. There is no information about the hierarchy and where do you fall within the management
2157,Work/life balance sadly out of whack. Some management resort to more stick than carrot to get short term bump in performance. Sometimes asked to sacrifice long term relationship with customer in exchange for small short term revenue.
2169,"""Diversity"" - There's a good lip service but, the reality is that upper management is mostly white. Until there is massive change in how recruiting and cultivating talent happens in the tech industry white guys are going to begat more white guys. Chances are pretty good they don't have friends or connections who are POC. This also holds true from people who come from other tech companies. When rats jump the ship they tend to bring other rats with them. Not so subtle hints that you have to hold a ""right"" set of beliefs/values - you have to get onboard or made to feel like an outsider. If you question or don't hold a certain The idea that Salesforce can save the human race - Salesforce is an innovative tech company with products and services that help customers do business. Be that! While SF is the biggest and holds a huge marketshare, it has created this idea that it can somehow save the world. Surrounded by lots of people who don't actually work with you - there are some teams that have a larger representation in certain hubs but, if you have a team that is largely based in one hub it can get lonely being surrounded by people who are largely irrelevant to your daily work life. It can also infringe on W/L balance. Ohana seating - Gross. Everyone needs their own desk and space. ""Data Driven"" - Sometimes translates to manipulating for personal gain and benefit."
2196,"Your experience here will completely depend on your direct manager and reporting line - and that's a very mixed bag of people. There is a lot of ego at play in some leaders and a total lack of EQ/empathy - be sure to interview your manager through the hiring process. There is nothing as demotivating as a sales manager who doesn't have basic leadership skills or self awareness. They have over hired Account Executives as they believe that this will drive limitless growth in the region. Result being that everyone has territories that are too small to give them a reasonable chance at succeeding. Attainment is poor even from those who have been with the business a number of years and have been successful in their previous roles. This DOESN'T stop huge amounts of pressure being placed on each individual to hit pipe gen and sales targets (even during COVID). Very few people have hit their quota or anywhere near it in the last few years. 5-7 years ago this probably would have been a great place to work but it has changed considerably since then. People don't trust the anonymous feedback surveys so the business doesn't understand the huge amount of grumbling that is happening behind the scenes. AEs are unhappy and many are looking elsewhere. But management also does its best to make you fearful about leaving in order to keep you in place to avoid more turnover. They made most of their customer success group redundant last year. Aside from COVID, there seems to be a major aversion to letting people work from home which to me highlights that there is a lack of trust in their people. Some management speak down to their team like they are children. Very few female leaders in the sales team - not sure the organisation is honestly asking themselves why this is? People talk the talk about diversity because it's a SFDC value but that's not necessarily how they really think or execute. I don't even think most of them are capable of thinking outside their own experience."
2207,"I’ve only been with the company for a few months, and it was my dream company to work for. I fell for the hype, the branding, the “perks”, the “culture”, the philanthropy. Now, I can speak from experience that the culture is fake. Benioff might mean well and the company might provide perks so that from those on the outside looking in, this is a great place to work. I just know that during the months I’ve been here, I haven’t had any time to see the Salesforce park or have coffee in the Ohana floor. I’m on a small team and other than my manager, the others have not said 3 words to me, unless I’m talking to them in a group setting. No “how was your day?” Or “Do you want me to show you around?” How’s that for culture? I tried to walk to a meeting with a team member and she completely ignored me. I’ve never felt so lonely at a job. The Ohana seating makes it impossible to get to know anyone. I am so busy from the moment I get in but accomplish nothing. We have so many meetings... meetings 85% of my days to talk about nothing that can’t get accomplished through emails. Or the meeting is about the same things we just met about 2 hours ago. The culture is not about being productive or getting things done. It’s about looking/feeling like important topics are being discussed, sitting in conference rooms, and over complicating the strategy. We just spin and spin and then we go home, and do it again the next day. Every single thing I’ve worked on since I started have been scratched or changed because the process or overall strategy has changed. How does anyone work around here or get anything done in this type of setting and without concrete decisions being made? The on-boarding is very chaotic and management isn’t aligned with the actual on-boarding process. They don’t factor in how long the mandatory trailhead courses take or take the time to onboard you. Becoming Salesforce and Bootcamps are just thrown into the schedule and are disruptive to the day-to-day workflow. (I’ve had to reschedule because there are other meetings that conflict). I met someone, also new but on another team, who complained she doesn’t have time for bootcamp. Maybe it’s not necessary? Just show the new employees how to navigate the elevators in the tower... this took me weeks to figure out on my own."
2218,Not enough leaves to use and also micromanagement
2221,"Very much turning into Oracle. There's a science to success here and there are benchmarks to live up to. Like any other corporate environment, there are a lot of talented, smart, type-A individuals. Put too many people like this together and you run the risk of creating a toxic, impatient, self-interested culture. Sr. Management is pretty disconnected with what actually goes on the ground. Middle management is huge popularity contest. What bugged me this most is the preaching of diversity and inclusion, yet they constantly hire and promote a very disproportionate WHITE staff in their Sales org. Particularly evident in their Central teams. Very very few minority leaders and individual contributors are actually hired, retained, groomed for success, and promoted. It's almost as if they hire diversity to check a box for their board and shareholders? At the end of the day, yes, the best producers are rewarded, but if you're going to promote such values, at least walk the walk, because the company can definitely afford it."
2237,"Terrible management from the top. Leaders don’t care about their teams, they care about promotion and power. Leaders come from different companies with the intention to gain more visibility and status at salesforce. The company has been like that since 2018. People are not recognized by their hard work. People are recognized and promoted by their “marketing” values ( increase salesforce portfolio in the media, increase number of customers, increase status of Marc B, etc) . Leaders can be bullies and discriminate without any type of punishment. The “Ohana” culture is towards leaders / staff who are bullies but don’t get fire because they keep increase salesforce portfolio!"
2246,"Very fragmented, a lot of sprawl due to many acquisitions. Upper management is top notch. But as you move to middle management, the quality falls off. I wish the generosity for social awareness was mirrored in the work methods. Support for employees as people, but the budget process is same old corporate BS. Salesforce likes to think they are a super progressive employer. This is true for subjects like equal pay for equal work. But the are still too many turf battles between middle managers."
2281,"I’ve only been with the company for a few months, and it was my dream company to work for. I fell for the hype, the branding, the “perks”, the “culture”, the philanthropy. Now, I can speak from experience that the culture is fake. Benioff might mean well and the company might provide perks so that from those on the outside looking in, this is a great place to work. I just know that during the months I’ve been here, I haven’t had any time to see the Salesforce park or have coffee in the Ohana floor. I’m on a small team and other than my manager, the others have not said 3 words to me, unless I’m talking to them in a group setting. No “how was your day?” Or “Do you want me to show you around?” How’s that for culture? I tried to walk to a meeting with a team member and she completely ignored me. I’ve never felt so lonely at a job. The Ohana seating makes it impossible to get to know anyone. I am so busy from the moment I get in but accomplish nothing. We have so many meetings... meetings 85% of my days to talk about nothing that can’t get accomplished through emails. Or the meeting is about the same things we just met about 2 hours ago. The culture is not about being productive or getting things done. It’s about looking/feeling like important topics are being discussed, sitting in conference rooms, and over complicating the strategy. We just spin and spin and then we go home, and do it again the next day. Every single thing I’ve worked on since I started have been scratched or changed because the process or overall strategy has changed. How does anyone work around here or get anything done in this type of setting and without concrete decisions being made? The on-boarding is very chaotic and management isn’t aligned with the actual on-boarding process. They don’t factor in how long the mandatory trailhead courses take or take the time to onboard you. Becoming Salesforce and Bootcamps are just thrown into the schedule and are disruptive to the day-to-day workflow. (I’ve had to reschedule because there are other meetings that conflict). I met someone, also new but on another team, who complained she doesn’t have time for bootcamp. Maybe it’s not necessary? Just show the new employees how to navigate the elevators in the tower... this took me weeks to figure out on my own."
2286,Lots of ego in upper management. Dreamforce can be hard for some folks.
2339,"management, bureaucracy, hypocritical in Ethics/values messaging compared to overall reality"
2376,"Have you ever felt like just a number to a company? Well once you start your job at salesforce you become just one of the many thousands of AEs they have hired. You will be given a territory that will ultimately dictate how well you perform. Some AEs are given 2-3 territories while others are given just one. Regardless of your territory, you will have the exact same quota as those with larger ones. Its a numbers game to management. Your manager will want 2-3 of his or her AEs to do really well while everyone else struggles. You will have a monthly quota, your manager will be tasked with grinding you every month for every last dollar possible you can bring in. Not to mention 3 quarter ends and 1 year end, which many managers make you feel like the world is ending thereafter. Forget about a vacation at month end, quarter end or god forbid you have to miss January 31st."
2377,"Another tech giant trying to spread the company culture kool aid but doesn’t recognize or address terrible leaders and managers or self appointed “lead EAs”. Very toxic, backstabbing politics going on amongst executive assistants which creates an entire group of disgruntled, distrustful, and power hungry EAs and makes most EAs carry a bad reputation at Salesforce. Execs and managers who have EAs: some of them need serious management training and learn how to treat everyone under them fairly. This was by far some of the worst treatment I’ve ever seen from an exec who had an EA. Micromanaging, having other people spy on the EA and report back to him about the EA's whereabouts and movement.. The EA was treated like a prisoner. Also, there are some EAs who support C-level people and they act as if they are the exec's themselves. They wield their execs' status for their own power and control over others. It's ridiculous and I don't know if the execs who have EAs even know that their EAs are doing this. I hated working with any execs who had EAs. It was always a massive hinderance to my work progress. I don't understand Salesforce and the EA culture.. some are really great EAs but some are terrible and unfortunately they are the EAs at the top.. usually supporting SVP and up. I wouldn’t buy into their culturally appropriated “OHANA” and other Hawaiian sayings. It’s all a facade."
2388,some organizations managers are screwed up and makes life hell like the one i work for.. frequent top management changes bringing in new company directions.. still feels like startup mode company with lack of direction in IT.
2397,Company is changing quickly. Culture is less transparent than compared to the past and there is a new management style.
2412,Too large of a company to feel important. Lack of transparency between the different level of management
2424,Management can be sometimes very unprofessional Integrity issues Too snobbish. Consider themselves the GODS of SaaS. A little away from reality. Micro-management and Bureaucratic Growth opportunities have been on a decline lately
2432,"Others have said it and I wholeheartedly agree. This was the worst professional experience of my career. Learned a lot about how truly horrible a company can treat their employees. Really hard to get a job here unless you know someone and I did--what I didn't know was how much I was lied to with the promise of making a living. The only people who are happy here are the young kids who are striving to achieve success early on in their careers and those who have been at the company for years who are favored and given the good patches to actually make their goal. Such an insidious culture with back stabbing, soul less individuals that starts with the top management and continues through middle management. They are the worst. The Junior VPs who have been there for years, so made it early on but they are worse than the Executive VPs because they really have no talent and have no clue how to manage good people. Turnover rate is ridiculous and the actual number of people who make their goal is so incredibly low. The cube culture ensures that your cold calling (which is mostly what it has become) is heard by your boss so he, and the tenured people around you, can berate you for not moving the deal along. And don't even think about working from home--get there at 7am or you are looked at as a loser for not being committed to the cause. Selfish, manic, loud, seductive people do well here for a while or at least until they slip up and end up with the Dakota patch. Or quit because they can not take it anymore. Drunken culture too which is encouraged by the annual Christmas party which costs millions--it's lavish and luxe--and shameful and gluttonous. I had 3 friends quit for the exact same reasons I did and we look back at the experience unfortunately in the nightmares that still occur for the ""month's end"" because we are not closing squat."
2435,"I am only giving the company three stars because while I enjoyed the perks of working for a well respected, game-changing company, I also did experience some negative experiences due to incompetent management, a high rate of turnover, and a limited amount of growth within the company. I felt as though there was a lot of brown nosing going on, and the politics was a huge reason for my departure. I also encountered more than 5 managers in my 2 1/2 years there which was disconcerting."
2450,"Favoritism by management. Accounts are hand selected so that favorites make their number while others are given ""whitespace"" accounts that don't buy. Marketing cloud is selling while service cloud is floundering."
2463,"People management is very bad... There is massive title inflation. 0-1 year of experience managing people marks most directors, and even many senior directors. There is a serious problem of cronyism in many departments. VPs promote who they want, when they want irrespective of team feedback or even despite what are believed to be established policies. VP-level leadership exhibits schizophrenic decision making, CYA behaviors and abrasive comportment. This makes for highly stressful working environments and is a key cause of the well-known burnout at Salesforce. Many leaders at Salesforce have never done a job this big before which can lend to insecurity and erratic or absent decision making. Reorganizations are painfully frequent which also promotes insecurity & stress."
2464,Quotas are unattainable. They are peanut butter spread with complete disregard as to what the opportunity is in the territory. The culture is not corporate at all-if you expect management to behave like adults then you need to look elsewhere. It is getting to be more like Oracle every day. No one cares about the customer or the employee.
2465,"Have you ever felt like just a number to a company? Well once you start your job at salesforce you become just one of the many thousands of AEs they have hired. You will be given a territory that will ultimately dictate how well you perform. Some AEs are given 2-3 territories while others are given just one.

Forget about a vacation at month end, quarter end or god forbid you have to miss January 31st."
2467,"Work-Life balance is very difficult to achieve in Sales organization. Constantly changing management with lots of Oracle culture seeping into Salesforce and it's not good. I feel like I'm back at Oracle now - not fun. This was not the case when I joined Salesforce 3 years ago. Many Oracle managers have not embraced the Salesforce culture, and have increased demands on sales performance, micro-managing, excess administrivia. The workload has increased with staffing not keeping pace. Over-sized workload is contributing to employee burn-out and compromising performance. And it's getting worse. Nothing matters but $$$ to most managers hired from Oracle. Loved the company when I started but my opinion has soured over the last 1-2 years."
2480,"lots of food is wasted, management style is not good. Too much micro-management, it seems like they do not trust their staff. No career path defined."
2506,I change managers two times a year. It seems like there are a lot of shuffling within middle management.
2512,In a support position it is difficult to get out. The management do not seem to be interested in helping their subordinates grow professionally.
2514,"The company grew too fast. Large amount of tech debt, hard to implement change in the environment, management lacks knowledge of the complex infrastructure and product. Everything in the IT and Operations teams ends up as a fire drill with no strategic direction to resolve the underlying causes."
2535,"Salesforce is growing rapidly, and as a result is hiring a large volume of unqualified middle management. Additional processes slow down sales cycles."
2539,"beware being perceived as ""too radical"" (trying to innovate here) in your proposals to management. it will limit your career incredibly fast."
2544,"Top heavy, upper management not in sync with what is happening on the ground, too many re-orgs."
2547,"Extremely short staffed, meaning workload is immense and the metrics pressure is insanely stupid putting undeserved pressure on employees. Upper management is completely clueless about anything that doesn't appear on their dashboard."
2555,In a support position it is difficult to get out. The management do not seem to be interested in helping their subordinates grow professionally.
2559,Great company but becoming too big for it's own good. Some of middle management is not very well qualified but are there by chance - timing. Can have a very Bro culture.
2564,"Very difficult to explore new opportunities if you're in the creative department. There's a real absence of leadership and management talent there. The atmosphere has been incredibly negative and political for the past 3 years, so if you're interested in another role you'll need to leave the company (you'll be given that advice if you express interest to your manager). The department is purposely trying to become an ad agency, except the department leads don't want to partner with other teams and are openly adversarial when they're not in front of execs. The department leads set a bad example by frequently talking trash about colleagues outside the creative team and that doesn't help anyone. If you're considering leaving your agency gig to take a client side role, this is not the place you'll want to call home."
2587,"-Work/life balance can be a challenge here, the company is very nimble (upper management) but do not consider downstream affects and operationally, can be very difficult to accommodate -Upper management usually does not care if you need to move mountains to accommodate their needs -Depending on your team, there is really little collaboration and teamwork, feels like every man for himself -The company focuses a lot on the sales org but very little on internal operations or internal groups which makes it hard to feel motivated to work here -This is the first job that i've ever had that I feel like I NEED to work during my vacations"
2594,To many SILO's Need better overall management in TechOps Invest in newer technologies Do not re-invent wheel; do not try to become Google/Facebook/Twitter....Salesforce has different business and SLA's with customers to meet customer business requirements. Customers rely on Salesforce to run there businesses.
2609,"Must learn the Salesforce way and abide by their playbook. Lot of promotions from within, so a lot of management started from the bottom and made their way up without much experience elsewhere."
2620,"Slightly unorganized, cross-department communication challenges, hard work-life balance, promotions constantly being given to upper management. Work-life balance can be very hard--not sure if this is the place for someone who only wants to work 8-5, especially within Product and Services. Although they say you're only expected to work 40-hour weeks, the reality is that everyone will be working 45-60, sometimes more during certain times of the year."
2622,"it's a really lame culture, and you're definitely a cog in a machine. you will never be anything of importance, and if you're coming from a company where you were formerly working close to upper management or inter-departmentally, WATCH OUT...that won't be happening here."
2626,"Few people making the water murky. Due to selfishness some people tend step on others feet, which I am pretty sure every company has it. Higher management doesn't seem to notice it very often"
2631,"Growing company size, more layers of management, decreased work patties"
2637,"Dysfunctional management, mixed messages, super political, many products don't connect w/each other....It's a marketing machine. The biggest slide ware company in SV. HR is all about protecting the VP's who are driving to get the #'s in."
2638,"Huge quotas, small territories. % of people hitting their quota. New management from Oracle is changing the culture in a not so positive way."
2641,"The management doesn't really work very well. Lots of lip service given to ""promote from within"" even though most positions are filled from outside the company."
2658,management is poor to work
2671,"Besides the corporate politics you'll have to deal with and that you'll be paid significantly less than the market rate. The company has become the very thing they said they wouldn't become, they're a huge corporation now and the people outside of the top 10% of officers are only numbers to management. Don't believe in the headlines or your recruiter, at Salesforce you're nothing more than a number."
2694,"Endless lower-level management churn, lots of non-standard tooling (non-transferable skills)"
2695,"Opportunity for advancement, management is not open to new ideas, and micromanagement"
2696,"Micro management, highly challenging quota, strict diligence to Salesforce utilization, double standard of performance vs vacation time"
2736,"Micro management, highly challenging quota, strict diligence to Salesforce utilization, double standard of performance vs vacation time"
2751,Constant changes in processes and management
2752,Poor middle management and too much favoritism
2776,"tough and aggressive quotas, a lot of politics in management"
2807,"Pay, management, cost of living"
2814,"Lot of politics, crappy tool and management."
2828,"- Change management and communication is not Salesforce's strong suit -- this can sometimes cause internal friction, or even have negative customer impacts because folks who need to know about changes may be not in a loop - Salesforce's approach and general attitude is very product, sales and marketing centric, which has been key to our success. However, for those of us who are in the services side of the business, the resources and enablement materials at our disposal is not as bountiful as they are, for say, SEs and AEs, so we not set up for success as much, making the job more difficult. - While Salesforce often says they put the customer at the center of everything they do, those who are not customer facing sometimes lack the ability to put themselves in customer shoes, but those of us who do interact with customers rely upon other internal teams to make them successful, so often times the biggest challenge is navigating our massive organization and hoping you'll be able to get the attention of the person who can help, and hoping they have the resources and time to help your customer."
2868,Must be good with politics and make sure to have management who could back you up for a promotion
2874,"- The biggest shock to me: how bad lower-level management is. Idk where these people came from but they are micromanaging, unrealistic, unhelpful, insulting...like the list really goes on. Maybe my expectations were too high coming to this amazing company but there needs to be more training for leaders. - Promotion process is terrible, you're expected to ""network"" to find any answers to anything and it ends up being a huge waste of time more often than not. And don't even think about leaving the sales org. Managers don't help and People across the company look down on BDRs. Also, the pay compared to other places is not good at all. $50K base in seat and after you promote to the next step. OTE increases in next role but not base salary no matter what you promo into. - High metrics, low commission - Like any other sales role, you are made to feel as though you are only as good as your numbers - The metrics are INSANE. Everyone knows people are just BS'ing their way through bc the metrics are so unrealistic - Work-life balance is horrible if you're actually trying to do your job the legit way and its high stress all the time despite whatever is going on in the world - Snobby AEs that are selfish but no one cares if you're hitting your number"
2882,favoritism - most senior management is worthless - people are overworked
2889,"Initial stage as a service consultancy. You have to find your own way. LACA region is pretty new and needs a lot of external expertise to build itself. Although it is necessary, it is still like a Frankenstein of methodologies and approaches that vary with management and teams."
2898,"We work way too much. It's not necessarily that there's management pressure for it, but we just feel passionate about the company and our work, so we end up working all the time. It takes conscious personal and management efforts to ensure we stick to not working, evenings, on weekends and holidays."
2904,Too many sales people and ever diminishing territories. Lower than average basic salary and huge competition for management roles within sales. High attrition of AE's with new new hires from outside poorly supported with a high failure rate.
2905,Work life balance is a challenge but it is supported by management.
2910,"Mid management showing the classic signs of maturing IT companies. Ethnic managerial cliques that only hire subordinates from their culture. Lack of rigor or attention to proper processes and procedures. Overselling internal developments and projects to upper management solely to obtain promotions. ""Don't care"" attitude and lack of transparency. ""We'll fix it in phase 2"" attitude to badly-planned projects. Phase 2 never happens though."
2915,Senior management priorities; no career conversations;
2925,- Brainwashed culture exists using Orwellian terminology like #dreamjob and Employee Success for HR - High school fist bumping mentality - Constant hypocrisy from the predominantly Caucasian management team who preach about diversity.
2952,"-Lots of middle management are poor at their jobs -Not enough mentoring or knowledge within middle management -Full of politics -Some really shady practices in middle management with managing subordinates, 'mentoring', etc"
2959,not enough transparency between management and employees
2960,- Numbers driven - Not local enough - Weak mid level management - Engaged in to much lip service - Full of politics and egos
2968,"False promises ""Fake"" culture Highschool mentalities Inexperienced-management Politics-lot of sucking up to mgmt Everyone's brain washed ""#dreamjob"""
2982,Middle management is not good
2989,"The management, especially in the technical support team doesn't back their team and never try to understand the challenges from the team's perspective"
3015,"Technically, the company is lackluster, yet has drunk it's own kool-aid, believing itself to be innovative. User interface is implemented with a proprietary framework (Aura) that is universally criticized by its users as inferior to Aspect and other industry standards, but is ferociously defended by company insiders. Similarly, storage is done via a proprietary layer atop a small number of massive Oracle databases. This means that one database outage affects a large number of customers. The Oracle centric mindset of the ""old boys"" has been incredibly resistant to change. Unit testing is slowly gaining acceptance, but is still by far the exception to the rule. The monolithic nature of the code base means that tests may take several days to catch regressions. Somehow, mediocrity and risk aversion have become the norm, perhaps due to the senior management blaming failures on the very staff who are doing more than the minimum possible, and are therefore ""visible""."
3019,"Chaotic at times, Higher management could be better"
3028,"- Completely focuses on sales, nothing else. All that matters to them is hitting quarterly numbers. - High Churn of people due to lack of training, management and high pressured cooker demanding instant results. - Poor leadership in place - often people who have done well put into management positions with no exp or people skills. - Zero career development and growth. - No culture - you will just be another number. - Many people unresponsive and hiding. - Very political and packed with egos. - management seem to ignore and look down on more junior employees as beneath them. - Poor communication to employees."
3040,"- In some cases management has little interest in the careers of those below them - There doesn't seem to be much interest in hiring less experienced people (including co-ops) - Acquisitions need to be integrated in a faster manner, and don't let them think they will keep their own branding and processes for long - Because the company is so huge, you tend not to know what is going on in the rest of the organization"
3049,"Lack of international market focus, Exec visits, investment, low standard marketing leadership roles that deal with politics more than actual work and delivery of progress. No action from top management."
3054,"-Even though there's a general relaxed attitude, you can feel pressure coming from multiple and different fronts demanding results -There's a general trend in the whole company to not respect working hours or when someone is on holidays, and to demand replies to emails and actions even though people are not working -One of the two offices in Dublin, Central Park, could be severely improved: having a proper canteen with lunch and breakfast menus, more parking spaces, more desks (there are 120 desks for over 300 account executives), more meeting rooms... -Some decisions coming from the top management lately have been done, in my impression, with the sense of being improvised and without the sufficient transparency towards the rest of the organisation."
3058,"With so many resources to access and great tools, Salesforce is highly process driven. The slight downside is that there is a need to maintain the personalised aspects of people management."
3072,"** Only meant for Dublin office * Don't mistake it for real Salesforce Almost negligible engineering presence. Very little to share and learn for engineering and software development. All kind of games being played as small number of staff wants to push into management. There's a huge hierarchy and it may be good on a global scale. But doesn't quite makes sense to have that in Dublin office. Some people are stuck in monotonous work and see move to management their only way out and act in poor spirit. If you are looking for good work and team, don't bother. Join a startup instead. Current state of Dublin office is worse than that. If it wasn't for larger organisation holding it to a structure, the place had been much more chaotic"
3085,"Failure in execution of vision and values at middle management If you're non-sales, you often get left out of company events / initiatives Promotion criteria (if actually issued) not followed consistently Constant expectation to do more with less Silos are everywhere - it's all about who you actually know and have a relationship with in other teams / functions if you want to find out what's happening / get anything done EMEA and APAC teams in support functions are an after thought - everything revolves around HQ and US Don't expect a work / life balance if you live in a time zone more than 2 hours different to San Francisco"
3092,Release cadence of Core (3 times a year) is forced on the rest of the company even if it doesn't make sense for the product you're on. Forced to dogfood our own internal project management software (GUS) which only maintained by a very small team. Open headcount is distributed blindly to projects that are stack-ranked in priority and there's not much to go around after the top 2 or 3 start hiring.
3094,As with many US based firms many of the mangers I had were based in the US. Most have zero idea on life in EMEA both business and culturally as they never got on a plane and been bothered to come here. This made them some of the most ignorant and useless people managers I have had the misfortune to work for and sadly nothing the UK management team could change or influence. If you join one of the companies which SFDC has taken over then good luck. It can take years for systems to join up and merged and this can lead to a huge duplication of effort and time. I did see some people make some good money here but lots running around chasing completely unattainable sales targets year after year. They seemed caught up in the hype rather than making money. Despite telling everyone that there are lots of career opportunities in the UK I did not see many at all. Again your career will be down to knowing the chosen three of four people within the business who can help you to get there. It seems like a long and tiresome process. Many of the management have come from the same background and company and this management style does show sadly. A few but not all where rude and unaaproachable despite constantly telling the company of their open door policy. Mark B is a charasmiatic leader and I wonder who would fill his large shoes once he departs.
3095,Where do I start . The only management in the Dublin office is a disgrace to salesforce and PARDOT. horrible person who rules with fear and causes more problems for everybody in PARDOT. But is protected from higher management. Over the last 2 years 70% of PARDOT employees quit and yet the company and management do nothing .
3098,Where to start.. The management alone is shocking. No leaders at all. Idea of leading a team is trying to trip then up and bully tactics. Egos come to play and there is allot of clicks in this business. If you not in the click you won't get promoted. What I really mean is if you don't do as they say and jump when they want.... You won't go anywhere. It's a real shame as the company based in the US where there is culture and values is not the same in the Dublin office. Management are doing you no justice as several people won't even apply for jobs as the word on the street in Dublin is there is one manager now promoted to a higher position who no one wants to work FOR. What happened to working with a company to succeed. But seems she is also untouchable as her click is supporting her. Real shame as in Dublin word spreads. Dublin office and managers in there are too far from the real culture of the company and the US Aren't getting the real story.

An appealing manifestation of how mediocrity wins out. All managment are arrogant and under skilled both form a sales coaching perspective and employee management perspective. Look into al there backgrounds in advance of joining. They all have had V/limited experience out side SFDC. Categorically - worst place I have ever worked. Made significant sums of money net monthly 30 / 40 K on occasions, and still left!!!!!"
3120,"Political, which is a given with the growth; middle management do not receive training in managing people and are often on power trips (likely based on insecurity); territories are far from equal and the company will double up territories for those they want to promote to make them look good and justify the promotion; too many people eg overlays, excessive levels of management trying to justify why they are employed and create a lot of extra work for AE's; takes away from selling and caring for the customers. Too much 'AE Enablement'...AE's are now Customer Success, Technical Support, Operations, Sales Engineers as instead of hiring resources, everyone wants to train AE's to do their job...not a good use of high paid employees and takes away from productivity and revenue driving activities. As AE's you are pretty much seen as a number and stat to 'stay in the box' without a lot of autonomy on how to spend your day. Lots of burnout if you get sucked into the monthly 'life or death' culture to meet quota or be ashamed."
3125,"A lot of inequality in how territories are broken out Management is generally good but there are people who have been promoted into management roles because of tenure, not because they're actually good managers"

3421,"Definitely one of the worst decisions of my life. You’d expect a company like Salesforce to have a smooth process. But here’s the real story- My onboarding and interview was an absolute nightmare. This was my dream company, so obviously when I received an offer from them, I accepted it, even if it meant taking a huge pay cut. These guys would leverage Salesforce US culture into talking you down for salaries but would say shamelessly that Salesforce has a transparent pay scale. When I entered the company, I found out that I was the least paid employee in the team. Anyhoo, I accepted the offer and it was their turn to send laptop and other peripherals. Well they didn’t, their procurement team never replied, not on slack, not on calls, not anywhere and I had to bring senior management into this. Well after 15 days of joining, I had received the laptop but mind you even though you don’t have your company phone or company laptop, they’ll start evaluating your performance from day 1, because dude you are in Business Development. So you gotta be an Einstien and a God maybe to do 500 billion things at one time and managers even then would find a way to complain. They expect us to work for 10 hours every day, attend useless meetings, and work like a machine without taking a breath. And they’ll preach about the helping culture of Salesforce, lol. The AEs don’t respond on time, hell even the managers themselves don’t respond until you ping them again and again. And they want us to feel gratitude for the company bevause it pays salary. They have 0 empathy for their employees, they turn deaf ear to our problems. I am suffocating here but I can’t teach out to anyone because guess what everyone is the same. This is a typical employee exploiting company which has created a bubble of a good work culture. PS- this is just for India. I have some friends in the US team of Salesforce and they are having their best time."

Was shocked by the level of micromanagement, time wasted on internal meetings, and sense of self-importance. Also, reps (often with manager support) spend a remarkable amount of time ""gaming"" the internal system. Setting up dupe accounts to manipulate commissions, a practice that often creates internal confusion which ultimately impacts the customer experience."

Generally speaking, people are very passionate which is great, but can lead to conflict if there are competing interests. This can be uncomfortable, but is something you have to get used to. Upper management is 50/50 on saying the right thing vs saying something completely tone deaf (though admittedly, this ratio is still much better than most places). Work life balance is often talked about and encouraged, but when push comes to shove, the work has to get done, and sometimes you’re left holding the short end of that stick."
4389,"I came into Salesforce like every rep, excited and eager to get my “MBA” in sales. Working here you’ll have to be prepared to give up everything just to stay afloat. In the first year you will most likely be given a terrible territory and what you do with it will decide your future here. Things you will need to juggle effortlessly or will lead you down the road of being let go are: - Activity- lots of calls. People who fib numbers here are celebrated by leadership but frowned upon by reps - Opp rigor- the amount of fields you will need to update are mind numbing - Pipeline- with a terrible territory be prepared to pipe aspirational pipeline that will be highly scrutinized - Prep meetings- there are endless prep meetings before calls. Due to schedules each person involved will require a prep meeting, leaving your day with little time for anything else. - Team selling- be prepared to sell with folks much junior than you and not held to as high of standards. If the deal falls through, it’s on you. There are a few coprimes that are skilled sales reps - Your “brand”- It’s important to maintain appearances, even on bad days. Your brand is determined by how involved you are in diversity, volunteer work, and leading the team, which requires tenure. -Manager 1:1’s- these are a trap to look out for. Salesforce preaches trust as one of it pillars, but beware that everything said in those meetings will be used against you when they have soured on you - Time management- working a 12 hr day is table stakes. There are endless distractions you will need to navigate and make hard decisions on “brand”/ appearance maintenance vs selling The work/life balance is very heavy on the work side. The exec team repeatedly say their biggest regrets are not spending enough time with family. This will never change if they don’t take it serious. There is a lot you can learn here but at the expense of your self confidence as some managers make you feel worthless when your awful territory isn’t performing. If that isn’t enough to make you steer clear, the pay is very low and less than 20% of reps hit their annual numbers The “Ohana” culture is a mirage. There is nothing remotely familial about the culture. It is an ultra competitive pressure cooker. I just had such higher hopes for my experience left disappointed..."
4425,"As someone whose been with the company many years, it has transitioned from a smaller, agile, product-focused company to a Marketing and Sales holding company that does little or no product development. Nearly every major product announcement over the last few years featured huge fanfare, but resulted in the product dying a quiet end within 2 years. Pretty much every major product announcement now is just a Marketing 're-alignment', rebranding existing products, not actually developing anything new. All innovation is bought, not developed internally, and there is little sign that the various acquisitions (Mule, Tableau, Slack) are actually creating a 2+2=5 effect. It really feels like a bunch of independent companies that are owned by the same conglomerate. The focus on growth by acquisition also means very limited growth opportunities internally since the existing products aren't really growing or innovating significantly, it isn't creating new positions. A new, related phenomenon is that in order to retain talent, many low-to-middle managers are getting 'promotions in place', i.e. they are getting a bigger title and more money without additional responsibility because their orgs aren't growing. So you see lots of VPs with only two directs who are also VPs, creating lots of unnecessary layers of management who all feel they have to micromanage those below them in order to show they are 'adding value'. This lack of organic growth means a lot of people are attritting because they don't see any real career path. Career development isn't a focus beyond the first line of management. After that its all operations, process and programs. Manager success is evaluated on how many programs did you develop and market, not how many employees did you develop or how productive and happy is your team. Another issue is the split between the company image and Sales. While I do think a lot of product and engineering people do really believe in the company values, remember, this is a company founded by a Sales Guy. There is a very cutthroat sales mentality inherited from Oracle that often sees sales reps and leaders blatantly ignore values like trust, equality and customer success in order to hit their quarterly number. Sales is really the #1 value. The large and not rationalized product stack means that often sales reps are pitted against each other because they have overlapping products, and the result can be the customer gets the product of the better rep, not the product they need. Many products are 'zombie' products with no future product development and virtually no support staff, but because there are reps with quota on them, they are still being sold despite the fact that the customer will likely attrit in a couple of years once they realize they've been sold a lemon. Turnover in the Sales org also means a lot of inexperienced account execs who have zero understanding of the products or the company culture but are still being put on big accounts. Over and over you'll hear how solutions teams are the most vital part of the sales organization, but every award, spiff or shoutout goes to the sales rep. You'll hear about some amazing demo that sold the deal but the only names you will here are 5 different reps/AEs, like they did all the work themselves. They'll pat themselves on the back, go off to sales club and collect a massive commission and the SE will get back to work. Another thing most new employees won't notice at first because they just got their nice offer package, is that Salesforce hires at much higher dollar amount than it pays existing employees. Pretty much every new hire will make a LOT more than everyone else on a team. It's joked repeatedly that if you want a raise or promotion, your best option is to leave the company and get re-hired in a year. Stock is incredibly stingy. Unlike most tech companies that do yearly refreshes, you will be lucky to get new RSUs every 3-4 years, even for very top performers. Many relatively senior employees (15+ years overall experience, 4+ with company) have NO stock. A team of 10 might get 2-3 stock refreshes in a year. This is the #1 retention tool, and yet Salesforce consistently lags behind all competitors here. A lot of lip-service is given to the 'giving back' part of the company. When I joined this was for real. You got a week of VTO time, and if you used all that you'd get a sizeable grant to give to a charity of your choice. They removed the grants a few years ago without making any real announcement. The VTO time is still there but if you are above a certain level, you are on 'unlimited' PTO (which means you can take what you want, but only if your manager is cool AND you don't feel guilty about taking off during whatever crisis is currently happening). This makes the VTO time meaningless, since it just gets blurred in with PTO and sick leave."

Smaller setups can work but if you are looking for the big benefits it requires time investment. - The 'family feel' push internally. This is really nice when you are newly immersed in it but you also need to be wary of assuming it's like a perfect family. Families have fights, internal squabbles and sometimes break apart so always look after your own future don't expect that completely from the company. - Steep learning curve if you've never worked on Salesforce product(s) before but there is lots of help there. Still a great place to work and earn professional experience or build your career. Genuinely love the company and everything they've done for me to date."

4697,"Where do I begin.... *pay is a joke compared to other large SaaS and tech companies. Even if you hit quota, which by the way barely happens. Please, please, please, don’t believe the hype. Less than 20 % of the people hit quota. I think in GRB it’s less than 10% for 2017. Regardless it’s a joke. I’ve worked at other tech companies and I’ve never seem anything so pathetic. *terrible middle management, I mean terrible. Keep in mind this review is coming from someone who was cosidered realtively succssful, and still think this place is a joke. Anyways, I digress.... Middle management for the most part is made up of people who lack leadership skills, talent, experience. It’s actually joke. It’s like a weird cesspool of account executives being promoted to management. One day theyre your peer, the next day, they’re your superior. Not saying they’re racist or anything, but holy hell, talk about 95% Caucasians Being promoted into these roles. Overall, management (based on my experience, observations, talking to peers,etc) literally brings NO value. They just sit at their computer and run reports, show up late to customer meetings, sit awkwardly/quietly in a conference room during a customer call, but during 1on1s (these are also frequent, redundant, waste of time), they offer to sit in on calls/meetings as if They are providing value. If you’re one of the unfortunate suckers/victims to work for Salesforce please please please understand, your entire success, compensation, will be 99% based on the territory handed to you. That’s it point blank. All the other BS, is Just that BS. Run a few reports and you’ll see the top performs get most of their ACV from organic aka gimmes or flips aka warm leads handed to them by the inside biz dev team. Team. Yes, working hard and doing everything the right way (by the book) will give you a very slight edge, but if you’re not handed a fruitful territory you WILL NOT hit quota or make money. Pleeeeasse, please take this as the truth. Again, I was a top 10-20% person, and I’m leaving this review. I could go on and on, but I’ll end it with this. If you’re an experienced sales professional, do NOT work here. You will regret it and regret it fast. If you’re a developer/coder then Salesforce might be a legit landing spot, otherwise look elsewhere."

It is a large company and different areas do things differently. - A ton of middle management and time spent in meetings. - While it is great to be a part of a global company, there are challenges involved in working at a remote location (i.e. not in San Francisco). We are often not a priority when SF is involved, so factoring in the time difference, you can be waiting day(s) to get issues resolved. - As with many companies of this size, a lot of ""hurry up and wait."" Get your work done according to a deadline, but watch it sit due to bureaucracy or changing priorities. - Salesforce isn't immune to a lot of the issues that plague software engineers everywhere.

4738,Below average people Bad executive management Terrible MS culture in infra
4749,"I joined a smaller company Salesforce owned that was eventually swallowed whole by the larger Salesforce company, and we were fully integrated into one of the major clouds. Things were very pleasant and work was interesting before the roll over into Salesforce. However, once my team joined the larger company, is when things took a turn unfortunately. I believe things took a turn because Salesforce is built on top down management. The bigger the title the bigger the voice you’ll have. People use their title as weight when making decisions. The overall design culture is perceived as a second thought to a lot of teams. Due in part that your engineers can and will make decisions for you based on seniority. Not all, but most teams have a hard time getting their engineers to innovate and work with them. This behavior also comes from the previously mentioned work life balance. Anything that looks like it may take an extra hour, will fall off your design quickly. Be carful of Kool-aid drinking. They use the term “Ohana”, family in Hawaiian culture (which is also cultural appropriation) to describe their own internal company culture. The management team uses this type of thinking to determine if your a team player or not. The type of “family” culture they perpetuate creates a lot of passive aggressive behavior. Add the behavioral issues onto the top down management, and you have a recipe for ladder climbing, favoritism, yes men, and brown nosing. The executive running the design on my cloud showed incredible bias and fueled this behavior. As well as some very questionable hiring and promotional practices. I felt their behavior was highly unethical, and they felt no remorse for their actions. The product you build at Salesforce will only ship 3 times a year. That’s if it ships at all. The pace is incredibly slow moving. I can not stress that enough. Changing an icon can literally take 9 months. This can make it hard to retain the talent that comes from a start up environment. Which Salesforce is in desperate need of. The salary is adequate at best for most designers. I found out later that I actually made much more coming from a different company and rolling into Salesforce. RSU’s are some of the lowest you’ll be awarded in the tech industry for a company this size. Most director level people get any meaningful stock refresher. Like I mentioned, top down management. I negotiated cash over RSU’s (which made my offer compelling). While a lot of what I wrote can seems very negative, not everyone I had the chance to work with made me feel this way. I did have the opportunity to meet “some” talented designers and engineers. I had the opportunity to volunteer and help others. The work I was doing at the time had impact up to certain point and I did learn a thing or two while at Salesforce. TL;DR: Top down management creates passive aggressive behavior. Slow moving development time, Salesforce only ships 3 times a year. Design is a second thought for most teams (but not all). Base salary is average, not competitive. RSU’s for a company this size are some of the worst in the industry."

Seeing lots and lots of angry current customers... 8/10 if you don't have 5-6+ years of inside/outside sales experience, you will only be considered for an SDR or BDR role. This could be fine, but the role should incorporate more closing of business if you are basically expecting people to take a demotion for the role and not articulating the position clearly (this could just be an issue with my office though). If you are on the BDR team you can be the hardest working person and still not hit your number because of how your quota is attained. Your manager will ""help you"" come up with ""strategic plans"" to hit your number (basically just tell you to make more calls/set meetings) but it doesn't matter because if you AEs refuse the meetings, don't feel like moving them to a stage 2 (everyone perceives what this means differently), don't have time to take them until the next month, etc. then you are screwed. BDR management doesn't align with AE management at all. Therefore, they don't care about anything except their AEs closing deals (I don't blame them!), they are annoyed when BDR management comes complaining that their AEs aren't working with their BDR... This is just not a conducive business model and doesn't help growth initiatives. Not everyone is measured the same. You could be aligned 2-4 AEs or 10-15 AEs as a BDR. Either way, these people are expected to generate the same amount of ""stage 2"" opportunity. If you have 2 AEs that are busy, don't work in your office or don't have the ""need"" for a BDR to generate pipeline - then you have NO chance of hitting your quota. SDRs, BDRs and AE's are all expected to generate their own pipeline - which makes sense but it is causing people to compete with each other which takes away from making the customer #1 priority. This is especially bad since the Mulesoft migration... (from BDR POV) Although Salesforce always talks about endless internal growth opportunities, this is def not something that I have seen to be encouraged. You are pretty much forced to take the typical promotion track. BDR Management is way too pushy with BDRs setting new meetings and business, while this should be a significant responsibility, lots of customers get mislead, forgotten, or treated with poor customer service which eventually will backfire (I have already seen it backfire a few times!) As a BDR you could generate $5mil in the pipeline one month, but only have 2 stage two opptys on the board (you need around 6-8)...which means you will miss your quota. Others could have 6-8 opptys on the board which only adds up to $300k in pipe for the month, but they will hit quota.. Doesn't make sense."
4793,Upper management is usually not qualifed
4799,"No career path or growth and terrible compensation. Nobody has a clear Understanding of responsibilities. Terrible management, there is little to no support from them. Low morale as a result of all of this."
4801,I change managers two times a year. It seems like there are a lot of shuffling within middle management.
4820,"- Hierarchical - Young, undeveloped management team - Over saturated sales talent pool"
4836,-Incompetent people with titles as 'research scientist' and 'research engineers' -You would instantly lose attraction to companies like Google/Facebook/Apple/Amazon if you go here. Common perception is that they hire lazy low-tier engineers/scientist -Many of the 'researchers/research scientists' do not even have a PhD. They are students/friends of the people in management who hire them without rigorous interviews - You won't learn anything since there is no innovation going on here. This will be problematic if you try to get a job at a real company and they ask you about your past experience.
4841,"Unpredictable hours, cyclical with high demands in Q4, YMMV by department. Advancement-hungry middle management can apply unnecessary pressures and derail individual trajectory in many ways. Potential for short-term outlook to negatively impact book of business long term. Top down management principals need to better discriminate by market segment."
4857,"If you're a Software Engineer looking to learn new technologies, create innovative technical solutions, or grow your career, I cannot stress to you enough to RUN AWAY from any opportunities at Salesforce Indy. The company culture would have you believe that Security/Trust trumps everything. Development machines are tightly locked down, and access to new technologies requires a multi-level approval process that can take months. While Security teams claim to ""partner"" with engineering teams, they impose security restrictions without any input from engineering and require layers of ""evidence"" as to why a restriction should be lifted (we're talking simple things like installing Docker). I was once told that ""Powershell is banned, access to it is completely forbidden"". Furthermore, the company claims to be Agile and is anything but. This is typical for large companies with internal software teams, but frankly I expected more from a company like Salesforce. User stores and bugs are tied back to epics that are ""committed"" to specific releases. They require stories that tie back outlining the project from start to finish, and individual stories are broken down further into ""tasks"" that really just lead to a tedious ""check the box"" workflow for most projects. If for some reason the project doesn't make it in the committed epic, prepare to be asked by multiple layers of management as to why it was dropped/delayed. If you're a developer looking for a 9-5 gig with the best benefits in town and an easy-going atmosphere, this might be for you. If you're a developer that wants to work with newer technologies and create truly innovative solutions to existing problems, look elsewhere. This job will not help you develop a better skillset, it will not help you work with newer tech, and it certainly won't allow you to come anywhere close to creating innovative solutions."
4864,Product management leadership focused on flash instead of substance
4874,"Salesforce is the most toxic organization I have ever worked for, and I've worked for a lot of organizations as both an FTE, contractor, and consultant over the past two decades. Trying to pare down what I want to warn others of is difficult. I'll just bullet it out and you can decide what would wear you down, disrupt your sleep, and leave you paranoid, the most. - 1:1s with senior management where the most hateful things are said about your character, etc., and then afterward, the manager acts as though it never happened. -Pressure to give Salesforce a glowing Glassdoor rating after less than 30 days at the company when you do not know enough to provide an accurate review. - No written reviews, something called a 9 box where management provides their opinion of you and tells you it exists but then says you are never allowed to see it, per H/R. - If you want to apply for an internal position, you must have your manager's permission first. If you tell your manager you want to apply for the role and he/she does not want to lose you, he/she just says, no, you do not have my permission. Game over, you are going no where. - If you are allowed a desk (many have to submit to hoteling and never knowing where they will sit day to day), no personal plants, photos, or non SF toys allowed. They want a uniform look to the desks. -Forced volunteerism, if you do not log your 50 hour minimum of volunteer hours per year, you will be shamed at team meetings. Doesn't matter if you have kids, sick parents, 60 hour work week, whatever, you are expected to make the minimum. -No criticism of Benioff permitted. And don't ever say out loud that you found it disturbing to see a laying on of hands and someone praying over him as though he were a prophet at an internal company meeting. Management will quickly remind you that he is leading the 4th industrial revolution and he is the leading mind of our time. -If you are managing young hourly employees, be prepared to be instructed that you are to tell them they MUST go to team dinners, volunteer events, and SF ""fun"" activities but this is not work, so they don't get paid. If you push back, you will be reprimanded for ""not being Ohana."" - Teams are run by popularity. Backstabbing, shaming, and shunning are used to get the teams to stay quiet about how bad things are. People who speak out about behaviors, lack of professionalism, etc. are labeled, ""unOhana"" and told that they are not acting like family. - When you interview and you take a position, there is ZERO guarantee that the role you interviewed for and were hired for is the role you will be doing. The management opinion is to hire highly qualified people, they will be so grateful to be permitted to work at Salesforce, they will do whatever job we give them. I kid you not, you may have more than a decade of experience, be highly technical, have managed teams, and be hired for a technical role, then be told you are going to do data entry level work and you will be glad you are permitted to be at this company doing that. -If you are uncomfortable participating in some public events, e.g. parades, events, etc., and SF is participating in one, there is incredible pressure to spend your weekend in the parade or event. The expectation is that Salesforce and its needs come first. I cannot stress this enough, you are told that Salesforce is YOUR family and your family comes first. A lack of loyalty to the company will get penalized far more significantly and quicker than complete incompetence, maliciousness, or even harassment. Salesforce demands absolute devotion."
4892,"- Every year Marc and Keith think it's ok to slash our pay and make it difficult to make any money. - 10% of AE's hit their annual number and OTE at SB and GRB segments - No enablement - Hire to many externals that have ZERO clue how to run an evaluation clogging up the promotional timeline for internal employees trying to advance. - Lowest Salary and Compensation in the market - even though we have the most expensive product - Keith Block is turning Salesforce into Oracle and culture and talent is fiercely diminishing. - No one is happy besides Upper Level Management - People go into management for wrong reasons (maternity leave so they can get 80% of OTE and be out office for 6-8 months providing no value to team and having no pressure of individual quota) - Marc uses Salesforce as a platform to promote his ridiculous political beliefs alienating all republican employees. - 50K base salary - Sales Ops and Finance dont pay people on time....EVER.. takes month for you're pay to reflect your title in Xactly. - Cant log the amount of hours you work because ""You should be able to get your job done working only 40 hrs"" They dont want to pay us. - They pay us like dogs and expect the world from us - Every year your territory shrinks, Quota's go up...Managment response is since we acquired more companies, new products should make up for added quota. - Internal recruiters do absolutely nothing to get anyone internally promoted (still unsure what they do all day) - Did I mention we only make 50K base?!!"
4895,"Innovation means constant change - not all employees can succeed in the environment, it's very demanding. Chaotic environment, less experienced management team. Focus is on growth. Some infrastructure in place but it's not the priority."
4918,Recently there have been what appear to be missteps on the transparency front. There is a distributed/remote policy that management's not able to clearly articulate and communication has been very spotty to the people affected. I have faith that the company will properly communicate the final decision but months of waiting without any substantial progress doesn't seem very Salesforce-like.
4930,"Lack of diversity in management, especially C-Suite. Retention of people of color is appalling. It's hard to find a person of color who is an a management-level or higher position."
4945,"Some growing pains but they recognize and act upon it quickly, rather than blaming employees Employees work hard here, yet management emphasizes wellness to avoid burnout"
4951,High turnover in sales management. Job satisfaction dependent on direct manager. Sales driven organisation
4957,Big change of human resource management happened while I was interning.
4966,- lower level management is poor in regards to management skills - weak H.R department when it comes to representing employees concerns - a TON of politics to deal with
4972,management is incompetent. many of the staff are incompetent. the titles are very much over inflated. They blatantly do not protect customer data. They place emphasis on loyalty over experience and expertise. They are very discriminatory.
4991,"A LOT of middle management. Too many 'bosses' and C-level execs accumulated from all the company acquisitions...way too much 'fat', too many cooks in the kitchen and any other metaphor you can add here."
4998,Since I'm not located in a hub office or HQ the visibility with management and opportunities for advancement seem less.
4999,"- Its not engineering company, let me clear, this is Sales/Market, they do it very well and they are great at it and they know it very well. - Half finished products, over marketed to kill competitors - Work at google/facebook, you realize the products they realize are how developers first, and how salesforce products are 'Sales' first - Work Life Balance - You better be ready to for it, you get burned out so easily, because of repeated release you are always in deadline and pressure to finish. Upper management in Evangelist Team should be engineers Dreamforce : Life is hell for employees, ready to work late hours, when I say, its mean 1 am in night and back again by 8am (Though excitement of carnival keep your motivated) - Salary low comparison to other competitors, you make more as Salesforce lead in other companies than salesforce itself - Stop politics in upper management, learn from Facebook/Google - Slow growth in Developer Relations/ Evangelist Team, you work hard, hard and hard and smart speakers takes the credit, you will be give 'bare minimum credit' of what you innovated or created from scratch - It is not an engineering company, you won't see real engineers in Facebook/Google for the most, they are innovative but deadline is more important that robust technologies, so clearly yes its not proper engineering company - Ask this question, how much Salesforce is used inside (Technical Evangelist) team, they know the platform is limited, but go in dreamforce, you see whole different story - Working both outside and inside Salesforce, I see major flaws in marketing of products and they way they actually are, clients are super pissed because of repeated and constant updates and low backward compatibility, they purchase and are stuck"
5007,"Broken promises: I was assured when I came on-board that the job was a contract-to-hire, but after the initial contract period was over, I was extended on the same contract and told that no full-time would be available. I was also told upon my initial visit to the office that I'd be visiting the office in-person several times a year, but after 7 months, there is no repeat visit on the horizon, so I feel very disconnected from the team. The only thing we actually do is build a web app that helps people send out marketing e-mails. I was excited about being part of something big that sets the industry standard, but I eventually figured out that couldn't care less for the company's product. My manager was changed halfway through my contract to a person who is a great coder but who has virtually no management experience, and she had two modes: ignore me completely and tell me everything is great, or micromanage my work with a critical eye and tell me I am going too slow and I don't deserve to bill for a full week. It didn't seem like she was capable of paying attention in a way that was really supportive. The last complaint I have is that priority decisions were made in a very top-down way without an intelligent eye on the effectiveness of work that's being done. Lots of automation coverage was built around medium to low priority test cases that were decided arbitrarily, while outstanding known defects and other important things were ignored."
5008,"Management - Many Managers, Few Leaders - Moral is low. Few are making quota. Micro management is pervasive. Management wants to own all the deals and tell AE's what to do and how to do it. There is no trust in the AE's ability to drive a deal to close. Management attempts to drive rep behavior by fear and focusing too much on the volume of activity. There is a lack of focus on being out in territory vs volume of remote calls / meetings. Management needs to do a better job of using the app to reference next steps and activity. AE's are asked to repeat what is already in the app and often a waste of time and meetings. Quota Attainment and Resources - Very few people are hitting quota and throwing more bodies at the problem is not solving it. We are short of SE's and SE management. We have way too many co-primes units and need to dissolve the service cloud co-prime role. GB and Select comp plan is not aligned to a ""monthly cadence"" and only can make , few people are achieving quota and management is terrible. Management constantly complaining to reps about activity, expense reports or closed business. Monthly cadence for sales isn't aligned to the comp plan for GB and Select roles. A lot of politics. Limited Work Life Balance and Always on Call - We are not doctors or solving the world's most important problems. We are sales reps for a tech company. We should not be on call every night, weekend and on PTO. Reps are NOT encourage to take time away to re-energized and refocus. When reps try to take time off, they are getting daily emails from management. Managers Get Unlimited PTO / Reps Get Very Limited PTO - Managers not get unlimited PTO due to a policy change in April 2017 where Director level and above (management) get unlimited PTO, Meanwhile AE reps are limited to about 2 weeks of PTO and still filling out weekly time sheets! Everyone should be on the same policy - unlimited PTO. Credit on Deals - Another example of the politics and toxic culture is having another AE get credit and commission credit for a large deal they did not do any work on. This impacts the moral, work environment, and obviously commission. Management often overlooks doing the right thing and being inflexible."
5011,"A LOT of middle management. Too many 'bosses' and C-level execs accumulated from all the company acquisitions...way too much 'fat', too many cooks in the kitchen and any other metaphor you can add here."
5023,"SALESFORCE no cons to working here, OLD company my old job was at a sunnyvale EHR startup and they have a repressive culture, long hours, low pay and bad culture with micromanagement"
5028,"management does not know how to handle a down economy or ensure that their sales team is motivated. there is some luck involved - you do not have to take a promotion if you do not think the territory will produce- research the trends - ask they will support your success- asks for more accounts- do what you need to be successful- because once you stop hitting your number, you will be asked to leave."
5050,"Disconnects between product management and engineering that are impactful to delivery speed and quality, 24/7 international business (pro and con) which makes work/life balance something that must be very well looked after."
5054,"Occasionally guidance from senior management for my team has been somewhat muddled, but overall there are very few downsides in working at Salesforce."
5055,To many SILO's Need better overall management in TechOps Invest in newer technologies Do not re-invent wheel; do not try to become Google/Facebook/Twitter....Salesforce has different business and SLA's with customers to meet customer business requirements. Customers rely on Salesforce to run there businesses.
5056,"Unfortunately there are a lot more Cons then there are Pros, which is a reflection of the location I was at: 1. The Management in Technical Support could use some Management training. Call Center management is well known for creating drama, poor morale, and inconsistency within the workplace. 2. The Managers create a toxic environment by not caring about employee welfare and falsifying information to employees. The company prides itself in transparency, but it doesn't seem that, that is the case. 3. If your not based in the headquarters office, it is extremely difficult to move into a new position, especially when your Managers has little to no interest in helping you grow professionally. 4. Employees are not held to the same standard as their peers. If your Manager likes you, you can get away with whatever you want. If he/she doesn't like you, you should plan on finding a new job as they will lie to upper management. 5. Upon starting a position with Salesforce, do not expect training because you're not going to get it. They would rather have you slave away fixing their previous mistakes, rather than properly train you to be efficient and knowledgeable about the product. The ramping up process is an absolute joke and an insult! 6. There is not one Manager who can do your job. None of the Manager's know the Salesforce platform or have any technical aptitude. 7. It is easy to get burnt out. For example 10 of the 12 months of my employment has consisted of 50 hour work weeks, full of insane workloads and the pressure to maintain specific metrics. They will squeeze every last bit of sanity and work out of you and all you get in return is the Managers cooking breakfast for you, which is an insult. Not only can they not manage, but they're also terrible cooks as well. 8. There is a lot of self-serving people in Technical Support and on Account Management teams. Rather than being one united team, people only look out for themselves and will quickly step on your toes if it suits them. 9. Your peers may appear to be on your side and want to make positive change with you. But they will be quick to stab you in the back if it means they will get in trouble.. Major lack of ""testinal fortitude"". 10.The morale in the office is equivalent to a prison. 11. As a Manager you should leave personal opinions and judgments at the door. 12. You can be extremely lazy, but have a good attitude and you will be treated like a top tier employee. If your a top performer but have the occasional bad day due to the high work volume and terrible workplace environment, your career will not flourish. 13. Managers are never available. And when they are, if you have questions or concerns, it is a huge convenience for them. 14. The platform UI is straight out of 2005. Who uses i-Frames anymore? 15. There's a lack of tools and resources available to do our jobs and Management will tell you the resources are coming, but they never do. Of if you do get them, it is too little, too late. 16. The company has lost its vision.. Being innovative doesn't involve buying other platforms/software and integrating it into your own. It is creating the product on your own."
5066,"Bad managers thrive creating terrible and deep differences between departments and culture. Extremely difficult for an employee to seek help or remediation from bad situations - ""star"" executives trump any negativity surrounding them. No performance management process which leads to discretionary and highly subjective annual reward and comp process. No long term plan and huge disconnects between finance, real estate, and business groups. Rapid employee growth without thought leading to high OpEx and zero profit."
5070,"The trust team (security) at Salesforce has changed dramatically in the past year with the new management. Limited career advancement opportunities beyond appointed positions that seem to be exclusive to former Microsoft only. Training opportunities have dwindled leaving managers to have to fight for each budget line item. People are leaving the security team in droves, at least 2 a month for the past 6 months leave a massive culture shift."
5071,Need more diversity and people of color in management positions
5072,Salesforce tends to acquire with little emphasis on actually integrating behind the scenes outside of the products - something exacerbated by them acquiring Demandware when the dust of Demandware acquiring Tomax hadn't yet settled. The Salt Lake City office has a very different vibe than other Demandware or Salesforce locations. There are some passive aggressive personalities in it due to some painfully obvious coddling by prior (and some present) management. Many hold job titles that are not at parity with industry guidelines and somehow think that they are 'special' when they wouldn't survive a month in that role elsewhere. People tend to withhold information whether it's dodging questions they know the answers to or refusing to document things because they view themselves as more valuable with secrets locked in their heads. For the technical professional who wants to come in and get things accomplished the SLC office culture will wear on you. It is the opposite of collaborative except for a few key people working hard to change the dynamic.
5088,"A few months ago, there was a large surge of hiring. Most of the hires came from a third party vendor that was closing. Some of the new hires from this location were previously denied applicants. I discovered that these new employees were being hired in Senior positions over me, making more money than me, and were even given relocation bonuses that I was told I could not have when I relocated in the previous year to work for this company. When I was first hired, the interview process seemed incredibly difficult to get through. Once they had seats to fill, it became a mad dash to find anyone with any Salesforce experience to fill the seats, and they seemed to do anything to get those people here. I am now left feeling worthless and insignificant in my surroundings. My experience, hard work, and dedication to this company is now meshed into a field of call center employees dashing to meet metrics. On top of the new employees that were hired from this vendor, they also hired managers. I know that people take time to adjust, but these managers are killing our vibe. Salesforce prides itself on transparency. These managers keep secrets and treat employees like worker bees. We have had multiple interactions with upper management where they will talk about a big change, and act surprised when they find out that those of us at the bottom didn't know about the change. The new managers don't understand the need for work and life balance. We previously had options to work remotely when we were ill, or even having an off day. Where we were didn't matter as long as we were doing our jobs. Now, if you are sick and want to work from home, you are asked to take PTO (since you are not given Sick time, you need to use your vacation time)more often, which encourages sick people to come to work and spread their illness throughout the building. Talent seems to mean nothing here as well. It's all about how many years of service. I know of employees who don't put in the effort , who barely get their work done, and they are promoted because of how long they've been here, while I train other employees, mentor, and do still meet metrics, and I'm stuck at the same level. You report to a manager here, but good luck finding your manager if you need something. The Managers are presented as people managers, but when it really comes down to it, they are project managers. I end up doing many small tasks for my manager, that my manager doesn't have time to do, in order to keep my team running smoothly. By no means do I blame my manager for this, but they need to take some of this off their plates. They seem to work 24 hours a day. We recently had a huge push to get our case load down to a specific number. Our portion of the Organization spent 10 weeks squeezing every last drop out of every single one of us to close as many cases as possible. The communication that was sent out read as ""I know you are working hard and thank you for your efforts, but work harder"". After week 8, everyone around me was miserable. There were daily meltdowns from ""Analysts"" who were mad at customers for needing help, when the real problem was the amount of work they expected us to do, and the free time outside of work they expected us to sacrifice. Of course, management didn't see these meltdowns because they were off running Reports on metrics and trying to over analyze the reason behind xyz. When I first came here, I really thought that this was a career. It now feels now different than any call center or retail job I have worked in. This is the longest I've ever worked at a company without receiving a promotion."
5098,"Unhealthy competition, unreasonable expectations, uninspiring and unskilled/non technical middle management."
5111,Ever re-shuffling of management and organizational structure
5112,"Reorgs happen frequently making it difficult to get in a groove with a consistent management structure (or even team members). Too many projects are done in haste without a long term vision or evaluation of what would be the best approach for maximizing success. It's difficult to advance with all of the hiring and reorg changes. A popular saying is that ""we are building the plane while it is in the air"". That's not always a good thing."
5115,"Inept managers, toxic politics I worked with ""the creative group"" within the marketing organization. The creative team is full of creatives that are half asleep and just there for the check. The team structure - product vertices, aka ""clouds"", paying for your position as a creative/ Program Manager/ media etc, but not considering a part of their cloud per se is weird and causes a lot of issues. Middle management in this group is inept on a good day. I feel like I actually lost ground on skill development while here. Overall some of the worst politics I've ever encountered."
5117,"Comp plans reward AE's, SE's not so much.

5168,"In my career at Salesforce, I saw many individual contributors promoted into people manager. While it's great for career development, unfortunately, in most cases these managers are unprepared to manage other employees. Taking manager training is not enough. Inexperienced managers become abusive and micromanager. They don't know how to treat their employees. Unfortunately, management allows this as long as work gets done."
5174,"Lots of posturing, no trust and micro management. If you are not in the office they think you're not working even though the position is customer facing sales. They hire young and the arrogant and if you happen to be older (35+ ) you will not fit in especially if you have a family."

5262,"Higher up management seem to be missing the reality of what occurs, but the managers do bring this to them at times."
5270,"Some disconnect between senior management and the workers (like every company). Lack of integration between products makes product development frustrating because we constantly fight fires while trying to improve the product. One or the other has to give all the time. Every employee event feels a little weird with Hawaiian music, Buddhist prayers and cartoon mascots. The outside reputation of Salesforce being a cult are far overstated, but it does feel like the culture overall is a bit hodgepodge and unfocused. While promotions are frequent, it's a very flat organization, so there isn't a ton of room for upward mobility. Most people just get a ""Senior"" or ""Director"" slapped to their title, and then if you want more, it's either lateral or out. The problem is that lateral moves are kind of limited without learning an entirely new job function."
5275,"New AE product enablement is embarrassingly bad. The first 12 months are sink or swim, and aside from self-enabling yourself, the territories are hit or miss. Sales reps that have crushed their quota at other companies often struggle due to poor territory carves and slow enablement ramp time. Furthermore, Marketing Cloud basically acts as its own company within Salesforce. Collaboration with the CRM business is weak at best, and Marketing Cloud's biggest competitor has been its own internal solution, Pardot. Last, sales managers here are mostly just that, managers. True leaders in management are few and far between. For example, struggling AEs are mostly on their own to figure it out, which is resulting in higher AE turnover."

Work never ends. - Very performance driven, always high pressure to sell more, a lot of forecasting and at times micro-management. - Management is lacking coaching/people/leadership skills, you are heavily managed on opportunities and numbers, but very little on personal improvement. - Politics are present, as well as ego-centrism within sales & mngmnt. - Achieving your target depends on the distribution of accounts and opportunities, which changes every year. - Very complex internal organisation that can come across as impersonal at times. eg no HR and if you have questions you can only log tickets."
5335,"- Sometimes unrealistic sales / business management expectations from product resulting in oversells, it's a solid product but there's a lot of work needed to get to a setup that will do well on the enterprise scale. Smaller setups can work but if you are looking for the big benefits it requires time investment. - The 'family feel' push internally. This is really nice when you are newly immersed in it but you also need to be wary of assuming it's like a perfect family. Families have fights, internal squabbles and sometimes break apart so always look after your own future don't expect that completely from the company. - Steep learning curve if you've never worked on Salesforce product(s) before but there is lots of help there. Still a great place to work and earn professional experience or build your career. Genuinely love the company and everything they've done for me to date."
5360,Customer Success Group however is somehow seen and treated as second class in the company. Career possibilities within that group is limited and people management by management is not focusing on making people great to keep satisfaction high and attrition low. Turnover is raising but reasons behind that not taking care off.
5371,"Old boys network, unless you are best friends with management you won't get a promotion, back stabbing culture and very political. Anyone who is a decent person or good at their job has left or is thinking about it."
5414,Some big company activity-based metrics creeping into the sales management process. Questions about the number and focus of middle tier management.
5445,maintaining good hirerchy level and management
5455,"Micromanagement in biz dev, long promotion period"
5464,No timely salar or management
5475,Horrible management Worst leadership Toxic culture Very political and unhealthy peers No proper training
5478,"Poor management with no sense of leadership, have to manage up and be highly political which is tough due to the lack of trust and accountability. Most managers don't have an interest in developing, coaching or helping their team. They are paid on the performance of a territories growth and not individual success so as long as they are hitting YOY targets, which means they aren't concerned about individual success. Success is heavily dependent on the territory and winning the ""Salesforce lottery."" People seem friendly but are very exclusive with only your ""brand"" being the leverage you have for success-- even if you are performing well or the hardest working. If you are looking to move verticals etc.. you can easily be blocked by your manager if they want to keep you for their self-interests. The management has created a self-serving environment where people don't really care or want you to have a fulfilling career. You will be shunned and humiliated in front of others if you speak up. It is not encouraged to give honest feedback."
5481,Young people in the management are inexperienced and proud as it was a small company and suddenly gained a lot of fame and they rose to a higher management position. They sometimes don't know how to give positive feedback but do a superb job in providing negative feedback.
5490,treat new comers with contempt there is no real management support due to fast pace tedious work in a Machiavellian environment
5492,Some of the older employees have a great sense of entitlement and huge egos and treat newer folks unfailrly. Some groups go nuts following the internal agile development methodology actually ending up being less effective. Too many layers of management creeping in as the company grows leading to excessive bureaucracy and politics.
5513,"The company is not well organized and goes through reorganizations and direction changes frequently. Infrastructure is fragile, and management tends to throw people at issues to solve problems for the moment. Compensation is high because internal competition, long hours and management self-preservation make the company a difficult and trying place to work."
5517,Insane workloads and expectations by management. Overtime is essentially required in order to meet quotas. Management makes a lot of lip service about work/life balance but it doesn't exist. Middle-management are all yes men who drink the company Kool-Aid and never listen to employee feedback. Management is usually head down into reports rather than actually working with their employees.
5520,"The Support Organization is led by less-than-capable management, starting from the very top. Management styles here rely on scare tactics to try and keep you producing at 120%. Too many managers doing nothing but ""managing""; too few people doing the ""real"" work. Too much hype, too little substance. Absolutely no work-life balance."
5521,Micromanagement style gets old really fast.
5522,"Occasionally guidance from senior management for my team has been somewhat muddled, but overall there are very few downsides in working at Salesforce."
5529,Sales driven culture can be a money-chasing grind Lean staffing leads to overwork and burnout Performance management isn't good Constant changes lead to confusion and inefficiency
5531,"Lack of process, planning is poor in some areas. Some people in management believe that we are still a startup, which can be limiting. Staffing is lean and staff are very, very busy!"
5534,Overhired too many salespeople average attainment less than 40% Management feels thats appropriate 7 or 8 Salesreps per Sales engineer Micromanagement on lack of long term focus Extreme pettyness and incompetence
5535,Middle management needs improvement Internal career growth has not be good - I see a lot of hiring of middle management from outside instead of growing internal people Priority changes frequently at the lower level even with a clear big picture at the top Lots of political land mines to navigate Work life balance is given lip service but must be defended by the individual (probably related to poor middle management)
5537,"politics the highs are great, but the lows are very low it's an you're in or you're out culture getting large management not engaged in growing careers"
5546,poor mid level managers and management training
5551,"Politics. Its the downside of the company. Middle management is all about self advancement. They pretend to care and listen to the employees, but don't really."
5553,"Clear disorganization in middle management, lack of clear strategic direction for field organizations, lack of respect for employee work/life balance and lack of strong leadership at the mid-level"
5556,-management's short attention span -culture of unrealistic expectations -prioritization changes too rapid to keep up with
5558,"terrible middle-management, bullying of employees protected by HR, ability to get ahead rests solely on having a corporate ""sponsor"" internally (you get it) , bait and switch on territories, territories always very unequal even though they claim that they are all equal, high turnover has resulted in employees being given $10,000 spiffs this year for all hired sales referals - they claim this is due to growth but it is because AEs are often miserable, given an impossible job with an absurd quota, bullied until they experience physical and mental health problems (see ALL of the other reviews and associated comments posted here - click on the comments after each review, there are dozens or these reports), and then shown the door. you are either part of the ""old school"" crowd here who was with the company pre-IPO so like 5+ years at the company, or you are having a personal relationship with someone in management who is ""taking care of you,"" and then you are given preferential treatment i.e. vacation days not being tracked by your manager, cash-cow best territory year after year, etc. etc. ** OR YOU ARE NOT ** ... in which case you will probably not last here for more than 1-2 years, and probably not that long, because you will be treated poorly, given a territory that Benioff himself couldnt sell into (think rural Indiana and Idaho) and completely miserable. I can't count the # of AEs who fled this place in the 2009 timeframe - dozens. If you are crazy enough to take a job here, be sure you get the exact territory you will be covering written down as part of accepting the job offer - the bait and switch to lure people in here is well-known. You will be promised Chicago and leave your current job, get in the door, take your seat, and be given Louisiana (the boss' girlfriend will end up getting Chicago and no one will remember that you got told you were getting the Windy City - plus the boss' BF probably works in HR so no one to turn to in order to complain). Further, read ALL of the other reviews and comments here on Glassdoor.com - specifically the comments. Again there is a reason this company is giving out 10k referal bonuses to all employees who refer a salesperson who gets hired - and the employee(s) there will tell you how wonderful it is - they're desperate for new people to take the crap jobs so the AEs currently there get the good ones .... and the AEs want the 10k bonus for submitting your resume. They're so greedy for it - its all over LinkedIn constantly. PS - Don't believe the Forbes average salary hype either - that salary figure includes a tiny percentage of Sr. AEs who make $1M plus per year. Countless AEs didnt make jack above their base salary last year - ask about this. And if you get pushed out .... DO NOT LET THEM TALK YOU INTO SIGNING THEIR LEGAL WAIVERS TO PROTECT THEMSELVES"
5559,"management does not know how to handle a down economy or ensure that their sales team is motivated. there is some luck involved - you do not have to take a promotion if you do not think the territory will produce- research the trends - ask they will support your success- asks for more accounts- do what you need to be successful- because once you stop hitting your number, you will be asked to leave."
5561,"Poor management, many of whom are legacy from the startup days at Salesforce and this was one of their first jobs (?!). Benevolent dictators are allowed among the mgmt ranks. There isn't a system for evaluating mgmt talent and their notion of ""360 degree feedback"" is a joke: it only flows downward so you never have the opportunity to evaluate management."
5566,"beware being perceived as ""too radical"" (trying to innovate here) in your proposals to management. it will limit your career incredibly fast."
5568,"Salesforce.com moves at light speed, and is filled with overachievers. On top of these, expectations on one's performance are always high. The result of this is that you will constantly be struggling to achieve a balanced work/life ratio. Salesforce.com is fun, and it can be fun to get completely involved, and to immerse yourself in your work. However, you will find that working nights and weekends is pretty much a requirement to keep up with the pace, management expectations, and your coworkers. Unless your a workaholic, this gets old, and is probably the main reason why people end up leaving the company."
5569,"Politics Beware of Mid & senior level managers. They spend a lot of time trying to get projects, even if it mean screwing people who report to them. Unless you have a sugar daddy in management, don't expect promotions !!!"
5571,"Too many gunners, not enough true team players. Most middle management are terrible people managers...they are really high-level individual contributors who are just thrown into those roles."
5572,Very inexperienced top management. They seem to be mostly home grown with little experience working in the industry. Culture of back-stabbing staff and partners. Compnay vision is great but management is very political and short-sighted.
5577,"Very little team orientation - individuals want to be the superstar Immature management - lack of support, no prioritization of projects, constantly changing direction Managers do not value/appreciate individuals' skills and contribution Startup mentality - and the company is too big for that Chaotic environment does not always foster good thinking and decision-making"
5578,"One of the most stressful, high strung and political modern corporate environments outside of wall street...and it all starts from the very top. The CEO suffers from a big blind spot when it comes to running the company: he rules by diktat, asks for zero feedback, micromanages ad nauseum, and is a firm believer in the Art of War as management philosophy: his directs compete aggressively for his attention and approval and never openly disagree with him. He still runs the shop as if the company was a start-up and he had the insight to make calls on day to day minutia. Salesforce is quickly becoming internally bureaucratic and clunky; innovation, creativity and risk taking are highly discouraged. Long hours, zero respect for family or personal time (emailing and working on weekends and late at night is a widely accepted practice)."
5581,Average Compensation and Perks. Big company like management.
5603,"Innovation means constant change - not all employees can succeed in the environment, it's very demanding. Chaotic environment, less experienced management team. Focus is on growth. Some infrastructure in place but it's not the priority."
5617,"incredibly political; upper management shouts a lot; most managers are terrifed to even speak. promotions are based on who you know and how loud you shout rather than how talented you are. very toxic working environment. tremendous focus on the sales automation side, with a bizarre model of hiring more and more salespeople to flog the product, guaranteeing individual salespeople's revenue will be lower; they then fire the lower 10% of all salespeople every three months, so turnover is high and morale is in the toilet. 4000 employees but only 150 engineers; very sales heavy."
5626,"-Decisions are solely made my middle management and never includes the feedback of the team -Incompetent managers who should stick to selling -Management will take polls and votes and BLATANTLY go against the popular vote. Why vote? politics, politics, politics -Talks about being a hip progressive company, but C'mon, having to dress up EVERYDAY for inside sales?? -Cutthroat competitive atmosphere--prevents some good sales people from succeeding. -Sales managers don't do any real work. They don't sell or get involved in deals or support their team, just send out snapshots of everyone's performance. -Politics, politics, politics -Brown nosing is absolutely required. Numbers don't speak for themselves -HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE/SUPPORT--trust me. I can go on and on."
5627,"The politics in play prevent you from doing your job. You are not recognized for performance, and there are limited opportunities for growth. Salesforce overworks and underpays employees in key roles while rewarding employees in roles that are less critical. You are subjected to trial by fire with little or no management support."
5636,lower/mid management not always best qualified
5642,"zero work life balance, poor middle and senior management, lack of clear focus for day to day tasks, no family support"
5660,"Company is struggling with it's identify in some areas. Too many specialists serving a single customer. Often times you need to bring the entire office with you because there is a specialist for different functions (sales, service, cpq, commerce, marketing, oms , analytics, integration, trailhead, ). The frequency that salesforce changes their reps and alignment doesn't tend to sit well with most customers. This has created a struggle to expand, particularly in the enterprise space. Poor alignment between cloud teams for GTM. Most ""generalists"" or ""Account Directors"" are compensated for the efforts of specialists although they don't pull their weight. Many recent reps are fairly green and do not possess the maturity to run a proper sales cycle. Some specialists are running rogue/lone-wolf engagements which can torpedo deals/relationships. Management seems very metric driven, to a fault. Some executive leadership and middle management have no boundaries and will bombard your mobile on weekends. Often times they will assert themselves in your deals and cannibalize any value you've created by offering quarterly discounts to bring them forward."
5662,"1. From top to bottom 95% of employee in Hyderabad are Telgu. In the team meeting , desk every where they talk in Telgu. No one follow office etiquette and makes the culture toxic. 2. If you are a non-telgu employee your life will be hell here. They will assign more work to you and during appraisal telgu employee will get more hike % , stocks, promotion everything and a non-telgu guy have to listen blame and bad feedback. They will sideline you in all aspect. 3. You can't raise your concern to the HR or ethics department because there also telgu management and at the end they will prove that you are wrong. 4. Managers and Recruiters will highly exploit the employee Referral program . They will only refer and hire there known person to add more Telgu person in the team. No transparency in hiring and stopping the right talent to come in. I am not targeting or blaming Telgu people here but it is the people who are making the culture more Toxic here. Non-telgu will be minority highly exploited community here."
5704,Micromanagement is rampant. Promotions are often based on favoritism.
5736,high pressure and stressful management always focused on sales
5775,Upper management could be more empathic
5778,Some Equality issues as well as management /support
5779,Politics - poor management from direct managers
5785,"Long hours, bad people in management, extremely stressful, luxury sweatshop vibes"
5821,Poor middle management Poor opportunity to make target
5832,Some Equality issues as well as management /support
5834,1 Manager are having their favorite Engineers and they always appreciate only them. forget to get appreciation from Indian SRE managers. 2 Managers are always busy to play politics in the team instead of work. 3 Managers do not have the skills to improve the work environment as they hired only for micro management. 4 in Commerce cloud and marketing cloud India SRE managers(leadership) have hired from support and they are only and only playing politics and made their employees life hell. 5 HRs are nothing in salesforce. They are friends of managers so forget HR will support you. 6They are treating employees as their slaves and pretending like they are paying salaries from their pockets instead of salesforce. 7 Managers gives threatening to SRE employees to fire .
5861,"Seems to be more senior executives being hired don't personally believe in the values championed by Marc. A lot of focus with new management on rebranding and putting their stamp on the organization for the sake of change. Feedback is often requested, but there are boundaries to what can be said. One recent meeting a senior exec told their department to stop whining."
5880,"Opportunity for advancement, management is not open to new ideas, and micromanagement"
5905,Lower and middle management leave a lot to be desired. They parrot the party line about opportunities within the company but go well out of their way to step on any efforts at movement outside of the team.
5906,Sometimes there is a hands off management style
5920,Poor middle management and too much favoritism
5951,"Inexperienced management, no desire to advance, red tape"
5964,Cult-like culture; poor management - groups like platform led by fear and intimidation; decisions not data driven; inflation of titles causes lots of people in leadership that are not equipped to do their roles; there’s a huge backstabbing and political culture. They say customers and employees are priorities but there is no evidence to support any of this - in fact it is quite the opposite. Leadership is so out of touch with people and customers and the world that they constantly disappoint.
5986,"Politics. If you have only worked at small companies, big companies are a different beast. Salesforce, like any big company, has an element of politicking to it. At any company playing ""the game"" is important, so expect that here. Large quotas, and small patches. Salesforce has fine tuned territory management, and some ae's have stronger patches than others. It is important to succeed early and often so that you have the credibility to be assigned stronger accounts. New employees not willing to hustle and prove themselves do not last. This is how every big company is in my experience. If you don't have a ton of sales experience, make sure you start at a lower title with a larger territory. Big companies are harder to ""learn the ropes at"", as you are competing with the best of the best for things like territory. Other than the above, Salesforce has been the best move in my career, and I'm thrilled and proud to work here. I've never found a place without the above cons, and the pros far outweigh them for me."
6002,"I did say ""caveats"". -RSUs are low as compared to FAANG and there are no refreshers - hence, there are a lot of boomerangs, and a reputation as a ""retirement home"", because there is no reward for working harder if you are not also trying to get promoted. -Despite claiming to have a culture of open debate, it doesn't exist and there is seemingly no motivation to change this. For example, even though they say they will answer forum questions relating to the weekly allhands, they never do if it pertains to an internal policy. There is no upward feedback mechanism, except for your direct manager, and on many teams this is a ""player/coach"" who has no involvement in setting the policies of the department. There is an ""airing of grievances"" forum but it is heavily ""tone-policed"". Bottom line is that if you get stuck in a bad situation or team, your options are to change teams or leave, there is no opportunity to improve things from within. -Silos and a lack of coordination result in many internally competitive and duplicative efforts, and inefficiencies. Product-wise there is crossover between Marketing Cloud and Pardot, Tableau and Einstein; and Vlocity/CPQ/B2B Commerce for example. Whatever's new and shiny (acquisitions and Dreamforce announcements) gets love, but if your area is not, good luck getting Trailhead modules or product management to prioritize new feature development. There are approximately 90 billion different efforts to create documentation for consulting resources for how to do their job, all run by different groups and stored on different platforms. And because Slack and Microsoft are viewed as competitors, there is no company-wide collaboration tool like Slack or Teams, it's just a bunch of incomplete tools like Google Chat and Salesforce Chatter and Quip and email and.... -There tends to be a lot of politics between teams, even beyond the product-related competitive/redundancy issues. In short, if you like what you're doing, and who you're doing it for/with, you're in a great position. But if you don't, you're going to have a bad time. I don't know anyone who was unhappy with their situation in Salesforce who subsequently made it better, at least without changing teams."
6005,"Constant reorganizations can be fatiguing and a lot of them were terribly ineffective, but is to be expected with a company that challenges convention constantly. It has also been frustrating how often you will change managers, makes it very important to promote yourself up your management tree."
6019,"growing too fast lot of middle level management getting created very fast, losing the flat hierarchy"
6024,Micromanagement - Understandable with all the fresh out of college folk.
6031,Not competitive base salary - base salary has increased $2K with 3 promotions in 4 years All about making your manager and their manager more money. Compensation is not competitive anymore Culture has shifted and fun has been sucked out of the job. Declined in quality of new hires and the next generation of Salesforce employees and leaders. New leadership No work life balance Increase middle management creating more red tape and dissatisfied employees Salesforce say we are about diversity but 1 person is of color and 2 women on the executive committee. And we don't get MLK day off as a holiday
6039,Upper management (engineering) is incompetent and is killing the company
6048,"Things definitely changing after purchase by SalesForce.com. Becoming much more bureaucratic and annoying. Much less mutual respect and trust and much more ""top-down"" management approach. Before SF purchase, you were a cog in the wheel in the hands of a loving watchmaker. After SF purchase, you are a cog in the wheel on the wrist of an aggrandizing marketing ""visionary"". Way understaffed. Morale is at an all-time low after purchase."
6049,"Unfair/low pay for some high for others Management plays too many games - making false promises for promotion and pay raise with job offers they WILL NOT hold Unexperienced middle management perpetrate poor management style For employees needing sponsorship - they put a hold on my green card application for about 6 months with no explanation Not challenging work, not much learning nor growth No cutting edge technology or industry standard (mostly proprietary stuffs) Depending on the team, people can be very cut-throat Overall this is an environment where people are afraid to take risks because any mistake can and likely will be used against you"
6050,"Culture promotes self-preservation, finger-pointing and shirking responsibility for failure. Cutthroat, uncollaborative, immature management -- diminishing from the EVP level down."
6055,"As with any big company, the team you are on can drastically change your experience here but I am going to try to point out some of the general things. Also of note, before you read too much into the other reviews, take the time to notice how many of the 5 star reviews are can be summed up by ""great place to work but has growing pains"" or ""you get what you put in, slackers need not apply"". I will let you draw your own conclusion on why so many of these reviews sound like marketing message .... It doesnt look like ExactTarget understands that they are no longer a startup. The only people that thrive at ExactTarget are people that have no lives. 50+ hours of work a week is the norm and anyone that does less is considered a ""slacker"" as you might have seen in some of these other reviews. If you do the math, you'll realize that the decent paycheck, which is typically higher than the industry norm, ultimately falls woefully short when you look at how much you make an hour. As you work here, you come to find out that it is very much a cult mindset and you are either in or out. Job security comes from owning tribal knowledge of projects that are integrated in to the platform since documentation is apparently a running joke. There are many processes that have been implemented to ""streamline"" development but apparently the management style here is to implement ""solutions"" and ignore the results because the only thing that these processes have done is add one more point of failure to an already broken system. Contractors are treated as second class citizens. Its common knowledge. The way to get ahead is to brown nose and give up on life outside work. ET is founded on the principle that the reward for a job well done is an opportunity to do more. After the Salesforce acquisition morale and productivity have been at an all time low while frustrations and turn over have been on the other side of the scale."
6065,"Company is growing very fast, and with that comes layers and layers of management."
6069,"It's getting very political with the change of the guard to a more Oracle centric management team. Territories are thinly sliced and watered down unless you're in the good graces of your manager or the most senior person on your team, and if you're stuck with a bad one someone has to leave or get promoted for you to get a bigger slice. Work life balance is so/so...each manager determines if you can work from home with no real ""program"". Base salaries are below average in the industry."
6073,"Small territories, nepotism, highly political, short sighted goals and management, in the office 8-6pm. Do not go there if you have some sales experience as they heavily favor existing sales people."
6075,Need more people to keep up with growth. Middle management needs to be trained better
6082,-lack of transparency from upper management -limited growth outside of HQ
6084,Success is strongly based on territory Coaching from management can be vary vague and high level
6087,"Management, Management, and terrible management!"
6106,Lack of vision to push through large infra projects at the senior management level
6109,-Territories are not always equitable -internal politics -management needs to be more flexible.
6110,Future direction is a little foggy with new acquistions and management
6121,"Culture is being diluted lately by people from places like Oracle, extra layers of management add more processes and interdepartmental hurdles."
6131,If you like to work for a cut throat company and be just a number or worked for oracle before come to salesforce. I used to love this company because of their culture but the new management has destroyed it in less than 3 months. Such a shame !
6132,"Loyalty of leadership to staff, which used to be in the ""Pro"" category, is a thing of the past. It's rapidly becoming a ""throw anyone under the bus"" culture as people jockey to gain favor with the new layer of management. Some of the new senior layer of management appear inept and wholly unsuited for the task."
6139,"Red tape, big company woes. Often felt like management wasn't interested the careers of their direct reports and were too focused on self promotion. Small sample size though."
6147,"Terrible management, they #dreamjob all over everyone but morale is very low, antisocial culture"
6152,"- Cronyism seeping in. Growth is tied to how much you suck up to your management - Disagreements while encouraged on the surface, are dealt with serious repercussions covertly - Work-life balance is eroding thanks to inept managers - Top-down directives to teams is demoralizing"
6164,"They are hiring Account Executives so fast that managers are promising things that can't be delivered on (ie, Choice Accounts, Low Quota). After quitting your old job and signing on with Salesforce, all of those verbal promises go out the window. Quota isn't as discussed, and all the new Account Execs, regardless of experience get the shrapnel accounts. Salesforce.com sales management will say whatever you want to hear to get you in the door, after that all bets are off. If you come here, make sure you get your quota and territory list in the offer letter. If they are unwilling to do that, walk."
6169,Growing Pains. Bad Politics Very Weak Senior management The CEO hired Childhood friends who are now EVP's who don't have the knowledge or ability to organize the work and set up the processes to make a company of this size run smoothly Be warned Its better if you are in sales or an engineer but frustrating to get things done Bad politics
6174,"* If you're not part of the 'in crowd' when it comes to technical decisions, you're locked out * Development priorities are driven from mid-management, without technical understanding * No real path into management or lead technical roles * Constant reshuffling of technical management hierarchy; at least four times since I've been here"
6179,"high attrition, weak senior management layer"
6181,"Weak, egotitical management in certain areas Has become increasingly bureaucratic Poor integration of acquired companies Increasingly political atmosphere Company culture is suffering Ever-increasing Micromanagement"
6188,"1. You have to bear hell of politics 2. It was different when I started but now many of managers lie about promotions, bonus and green card process I think they purposefully delay so that they can retain employees. If they know you can not switch then they will give not give raise or agreed bonus as well. It happened with me. 3. Its not a technology company. There are multiple CTOs, my group CTO does not even know current technologies, they try to solve big data problems using PL/SQL and will force you to do the same even if you know Hadoop technologies or other upcoming technologies. 4. The promotion is based on number of check-ins you can make and managers openly tell that. Its absolutely not related whether you checked in test or some stupid UI / xml fix or a routine to mine billions of events to generate recommendations. How dumb management can be in technical aspect? 5. Most of the product managers and product directors are jokers, they decide future product direction and design with no technical background. They talk about topic extraction using UI and static categories. 6. Its all gonna go downhill with a burst of existing big customers leaving because product is good but page load performance sucks big time or if good technology company comes as a competitor. Its just a matter of time when it is going downhill."
6191,Company only understands direct sales and has not embraced and invested in indirect sales channels. Senior management of indirect sales has no experience or background. Consistently under invest and make short sighted decisions.
6197,"Top heavy, upper management not in sync with what is happening on the ground, too many re-orgs."
6202,"- too many teams working on the same problems, ignorant of each other - too many top-down directives that disrupt teams - too long a chain of middle management--communication between teams is ineffective or non-existent - infrastructure has not scaled with the company"
6204,"Equity and real money goes to the top in a vastly disproportionate way. Executives have disdain for equity sharing. Use M&A to mask no real internal product innovation in years. Each new generation of ""leadership"" is more manic and buzz-word fixated and insecure than the previous. Endless conversations about process, no productive output. No accountability for decision making. Decisions throughout the company are made privately and then imposed. Corporate holiday party spending is obscene. Everyone is a ""leader"" spending their time talking about process, very few are actually doing anything. Product has serious security flaws. Have not seen CEO on the floor in years New hires get dumber and dumber, are more and more scared of rocking the boat. Messengers are punished. Culture incents people to remain silent and go along with the head person's opinions. Basic cultural inability to use fact-based analysis to objectively evaluate performance or productivity. Managers use gossip to inform performance reviews. Management style throughout the company is very kabuki-ish. Obsessed with classist fear of being seen as touching technology. Employees spend more than 50% of their time socially managing their popularity collecting badges, recognitions and rewards in their gamified performance management system rather than doing their day job. Culture punishes people who say, ""No"", no matter the cost to the organization. Rewards go to the pacifiers, not the performers."
6210,poor middle management cronyism huge culture shift and growing pains; company has become a mini-Oracle haves and have-nots in sales
6214,Bad lower management - pals pulling pals from Oracle.
6215,comp First level of management seem to be new to management
6230,"Can be a grind, success depends on territory (but that is the life of sales, not unique to salesforce). Moving into management can take a while. Resources like sales overlay teams for complementary products, sales engineering, are scarce or not competent and your succes can depend on them."
6235,-Too many layers of management -Recent change in culture where teams do not want to take ownership or make deciscions (too much CYA)
6241,"Company has changed in the last 18 months. Upper management is out of touch. Each month end is like a ""quarter end"". Company has grown very fast and the infrastructure is not where it should be to support the growth, making it difficult at times to get the proper resources and support to do your job at the highest level. The tone of management has changed from a entrepreneurial do anything feel, to a restrictive and cold Oracle feel."
6247,"Facilities management is atrocious, no sabbaticals for tenured employees, massive growing pains due to rapid expansion, IT department is completely inept, not always supportive of work-life balance"
6259,"- You have to work! Leads to great learning opportunities and career satisfaction for the right people, but will be a con for those who want to get paid without doing the work - ""Growing pains"", as management team likes to say. Buddy Media is trying to figure out the best way to operate as a growing company, while still maintaining the small company magic. There have been several hits this year, but also some misses"
6265,"Highly political, closed door feeling from management."
6273,"Don't expect to impact the software products in a meaningful way while you are there. What you see when you get hired in terms of software coding practices is what you'll be expected to follow. And, unfortunately, there's lots of room for improvement. If you interview here, ask specific technical questions about software best practices and you're likely to get a clever ""non-answer."" A lot of nice talk about what could be done, but nothing specific that translates into actual work quality. While the Salesforce agile approach has all the ingredients a successful team can rely on, the use of those practices is whimsical. The management puts its confidence into junior employees who don't know a thing about building quality software. The middle management is useless on projects. The senior engineers are targets that get poked at ruthlessly. The website products are passable in quality, but the other products like mobile are lame. Lots of false starts and recalled releases from what I saw/heard from those teams. The product vision for the company is unrealistic and egotistical. Management professes that it wants their applications to have an ""addictive"" quality, but they don't even know how to approach that problem. I am glad I'm not there."
6279,- bad management - lack of communications
6289,"Besides the corporate politics you'll have to deal with and that you'll be paid significantly less than the market rate. The company has become the very thing they said they wouldn't become, they're a huge corporation now and the people outside of the top 10% of officers are only numbers to management. Don't believe in the headlines or your recruiter, at Salesforce you're nothing more than a number."
6308,"An exhausting amount of nonstop meetings to be on camera for, dizzying compensation (OTE) breakdown, not making OTE even though company is breaking records every quarter and year, tons of pressure from sales and leadership to produce, SE to AE ratio, the layoffs heard round the world (just not to us first), I feel like we are being sold to on company meetings more and more. For everything you notate in Salesforce and Quip be prepared to discuss with 3 levels of management on all the details several times a month in a nonproductive meeting. We don't use Salesforce the way we sell companies on using Salesforce and it shows in our meetings that could have been a Slack update. Did I mention overbooked calendar? Paid Overtime hours were taken away, but we work overtime anyway. Learning curve of Salesforce product names and jargon is never-ending. Training to AEs seems disproportionately shorter and less in depth to SEs and it impacts sales cycles."
6324,"A little ""fake"" sometimes. Wish there was more authentic communications from management"

6487,"Inexperienced management, no desire to advance, red tape"
6494,- large management layer - too many products
6503,Inconsistent communication from management regarding priorities
6511,"There is lots of work, but management is good about understanding we can't do it all."
6595,"There has been no attention paid to the mid level management that was hired. Especially in the IT Project team. People leave managers, not companies. I feel I work under a manager who is straight out of the Dilbert comic strip. Numerous attempts have been made to fix my working relationship with this manager, with no results. I strongly believe that there is severe incompetence for the role and position that this manager was hired for. Gaslighting, micromanagement, plagiarising ideas, absolute disregard for an employee’s personal time. Add to this the constant reminder of the said person’s insecurities being thrown around in the garb of constantly mentioning their decade-odd years of work experience. These are just some, among the many, problematic aspects that have caused demotivation. However. I would also like to clarify that the person in question is not bad or immoral. They only happen to be a bad fit in a managerial position. This company might be ranked as the best place to work at, but from an employee’s point of view, our life revolves around the people we work with/under, daily. It is unfortunate that it has as not fared well for me. It is quite drudgeoning to constantly hear the phrases “what!!!!!”, “that is not how it works” or “i don’t understand” up until today."
6607,Middle management are unfortunately more concerned with moving up the value chain than their customers and employees. A lot of politicking and backstabbing. No longer a meritocracy. High attrition of top performing Managers and Account Executives due to the above. Middle management out of touch with the frontline challenges. Pay is materially below the market average and competitors locally. Territories are too small for a high % of Account Executives to make money leading to high churn.
6622,"A growing layer of management, with awkward titles and difficult to discern responsibilities and unclear accountability. Some are not in daily client business and at risk of 'losing touch'. The consequence is low acceptance with this group decisions e.g. promotion rounds."

6629,"Depending on the department you work in, some of the management staff do not seem to fully grasp their own positions, and it makes it difficult for the people they are supposed to be managing"
6639,"Despite not wanting to acknowledge this fact, Salesforce is an incredibly political company to progress in. There is a heavy process around advancement, the main activity being developing your own brand. This involves gaining sponsors at various levels and promoting yourself (sometimes unashamedly) heavily throughout the business. This 'brand campaigning' is by definition political. It is also biased towards those that have the time to commit to it. It is largely dependant on a full and present management chain and those who are actually fully active making a difference at their customers, or who are under resourced and performing multiple roles to serve their customer, do not get the chance to 'seize the opportunity that Salesforce states that it presents. The result is that the talent in the business feel undervalued and the promotions go to the people who have shouted the loudest. It is a real shame, Salesforce isn't the company that I wanted it to be."
6647,Release cadence of Core (3 times a year) is forced on the rest of the company even if it doesn't make sense for the product you're on. Forced to dogfood our own internal project management software (GUS) which only maintained by a very small team. Open headcount is distributed blindly to projects that are stack-ranked in priority and there's not much to go around after the top 2 or 3 start hiring.
6651,"3 things have changed for me as having been with company for long time and I consider them all Cons 1. Salesforce prides itself on #ohana which is family. Salesforce #ohana is vibrabnt and alive and incredible. Unless you are in Sales in which case its non existent. It is run old school the Oracle way. 2. Customers suffer the most as they did when Sales Leadership ran Oracle. Salesforce is ruthless in scraping every penny from the client, making MSA difficult by not giving an inch on anything. Management wants the number period, if it helps the customer thats a bonus. 3. Execs get paid AE's do not. There are essentially 4 - 5 levels of Sales Management before you get to Keith Block. On the Ground Floor 7 AE's may each carry a number such as $2,000,000 US. There RVP number is not $14,000,000 but about $10 or $11,000,0000. This continues up the management change so at the highest level they will carry a quota that will significantly less the what the AE's carry. End result is Significant amount of reps will be below 50% attainment and my guess is a few percent will knock it out and may 10 to 15% actually hit their number. Opportunity to make real money like in the old days is very slim. Lot of Starving AE's which the company does not seem to mind as they make it very clear there are 10 people behind you waiting for your job."
6668,"- We do not live by the rules and values we portray to the world unfortunately - Constantly hiring new sales reps, with existing sales reps having fewer and fewer accounts. - The vast majority of sales reps do not reach their quota (Its good business that they don't). - Promotions only occur for those that have a friendly relationship with senior management, if you're not in the inner circle don't waste your time. - Quarterly driven business - Senior management will always have a say and at times take full control of your deal altogether (and that's because they trust you, imagine if they didn't)."
6698,Oracle 2.0 in terms of politics Many promises without any content Invisibility into management processes and decisions Generally not competitive salary within Dublin Office: - far outside the city - No assigned desk (about 5% work on the floor/ in the kitchen/ the staircase - you name it) - No canteen (two microwaves per floor) - No gym/pool etc. facilities every 6th BDR is not paid according to comp plan (you simply do not receive your commission and no replies to cases - you might get your commission 6 months later) -imbalanced territories (always the same territories on top of the dashboard on all levels) - For the DACH team: Congratulations to your recent top performing month with more than 30% of the reps hitting their target They will tell you a lot about career and progression but do not necessarily walk the talk
6704,"- Management roles are hard to come by, sometimes they prefer to fill management role from outside just because there is no one to replace the most eligible person to be promoted - Overall promotion process has gotten slower over the years, they might say its all your abilities but it some of it is also timebound now - HIGH POSSIBILITY of crazy work schedule and long hours, especially if you are an engineer but they give you comp days, but you might never have time to redeem those"
6705,Worst criminal management carried over from its previous dimdim
6734,- Increasing lack of transparency from upper management. - Growth having a negative affect on standards and culture. - Recent introduction of hot desking has turned the office into an impersonal and unwelcoming place to be. It's cost savings at the expense of employees interests. - Uncertainty over future unified office location in Dublin.
6735,"1. If you're hired as ""Success Agent Tier-2"" for CRM support then your Salesforce career is over because you'll be working in a specific skill group (Configuration, Usage or Email team) and do not get any chance to explore the real Salesforce CRM tool. 2. Management do not to monitor/plan their employees leaves(PTO's) properly which again makes very difficult to work with a huge backlog of cases. You can expect 25-30 cases per agent in AMER shift or 30-35 cases per agent in EMEA shift. NOTE: I have worked in Wipro (worst of all IT companies) so I am very well aware of overload/ extra amount of work. 3. They do not have enough ""Tier-3"" resource which makes your life miserable because as Tier-2, you'll be the only point of contact for the customer who has raised a case. If customer escalates the case or gives you DSAT due to the delay in resolution, then it won't affect Tier-3's performance. Management will simply blame you. 4. So many bugs/ Known issues in every major releases which will make you cry like hell as a support agent. 5. If you ask CSG management to hire more resources to reduce the back log, they'll simply say - ""No we cannot because we do not have enough budget"". 6. HR team sends out an employee survey link in each quarter but that doesn't make any change in your work life. 7. Also when it comes to ""Employee referral""(if your friends, relatives or siblings gets hired then you get $2000/each) program in Hyderabad is one of the most ""Corrupted"" program they've. I have seen 3 examples of corruption in referrals where managers referred their siblings who has really good terms with the ""hiring manager"". They all got selected and each manager earned easy $2000 + Family member (as a salesforce employee). So again if you're hired as Success agent Tier-2 then forget about referring anyone. 8. No way you will get Onsite chance. Strict policy. Also please do not dream of getting free passes/visit to Dreamforce event especially if you're in India. ()"

6792,"I have seen many reviews but no action yet. We only see the canned response. Biggest mistake by getting employees and management from Call centre culture. 2. Spoiled the work culture. Most of them doesn’t have knowledge or attitude to work in company like Salesforce. They are fit for BPO only. Salesforce values now changed from Trust to No-Trust. Now the culture is Politics, backstabbing, data manipulation. There was saying Getting into Salesforce is harder than getting into Harvard university. This doesn’t apply for Hyd CSG. Criteria for hyd CSG:- 1. Referred by Management 2. Wife can refer husband and vice-versa. True ohana can be seen here. Husband and wife working in same team, shift, and manager. Though we have policy around it, who cares need to focus on Ohana. If not in same team it’s very easy to work in same shift. Doesn’t make sense reaching out to ES as they are the one who gives offer letters. Promotion criteria:- management favourite. Need to know how to play politics. Backstabbing and how to get numbers. Management is afraid to take actions against non performers and people with wrong attitudes which actually spoiled the entire culture. list will go on..."
6796,"The ""best place to work for"" and ""ohana culture"" may be true for other countries or departments, but a big lie in Singapore Sales Development team. The management team is unreasonbale and sometimes even rude. The worst part is the politics.

6810,"* No transperancy from middle management. Senior management says something and middle mangement does totally opposite * Not compassionate or empathetic. * Poor Employee Success(They should be named as Employer Success) * Talks lot about Ohana, literally everywhere. But it doesn't come in practice. * Says lot about stakeholders. As an important stakeholder, an employee never been valued * Never expect job security. * Poor management decisions with business and no collective thoughts. * Female employees never valued as much as male. Never hired any female employees in most of the organizations. Mostly male dominated organizations. * Lots of serveys happens, but no action will be taken to correct things."
6848,"- Lack of Transparency in every thing, whether it is promotion, interviews, work etc. Promo - Collect feedback from your favourite people and get promoted to VP even if your sub ordinates or people working under you don't like your style of functioning. Just like typical Indian govt. office promo's where you throw money here you throw feedbacks. Interviews - Whom to hire for the position, what qualities to look for, what job responsibilities should be conveyed, no clarity. Hire and attract talent by throwing industry buzzwords like etc. containers, docker, kubernetes, etc and tell them to work on round the clock patching or deployment work. (No forum to raise this concern apart from glassdoor) - No clear vision from senior/mid senior management/infra leadership. People at bottom most level who don't know what they are supposed to be delivering in infra. Software engineers working on operations work to resolve switch issues and fixing racks, working with DC engineers. They don't have any clarity or vision of future from leadership. (No forum to raise this concern apart from glassdoor) - How to get all star award? Well there are lot of ways to achieve it: 1) Sit in US HQ office and screw things in production time and time again and get a all star award. If you do the same from Hyderabad then you will land into PIP (Performance improvement program). 2) Create a half baked software or an automation working in silo without taking any requirements from actual endusers. Create a hype around it, push it to prod with no proper testing, provide zero documentation, get stocks/promo's/all stars and then move out of the project to screw something else. - No alignment Work for some other team and report to someone else in the management chain who has no idea what are you doing. V2MoM of folks in hyderabad is more of marketing gimmick it fails to provide any alignment, clarity or vision for people working at the ground level. When you are asked to talk about it no ones know how to get it sorted, they just want to keep doing things the way they are because end of the day they are more concerned about there own promo's.

The R&D management does not offer growth, leaders of this group are very impatient and rude. Not worth being in good books. No respect given to peer’s and sub-ordinates, R&D management is only concerned about its own position and growth. 4. The management in Hyd office will claim that Salesforce among the best companies to work for - this is true but only applies to the US head office, certainly does not apply to Hyd office. 5. Don't be surprised that young employees working in this company for quiet some time can be political and very influential. 6. The maturity in most employees is below par. They have only one thought in mind, how to grow and get more money no matter if they have to step over there own colleague. 7. Work life balance is bad in some teams. Expectation is you will have to slog and meet the deadlines. If you don't then you need to look elsewhere. 8. Salesforce Hyd has always been on the HQ's radar in terms of quality of work and deliveries. Unfortunately the situation is not good. 9. Quality of work is ridiculously below par. People don't care if the code is messed up, all that is important is releasing the product with the proposed feature. 10. In some teams, employees argue and embarrass each other with respect to deliveries. They don’t care about one’s self respect, no respect for other colleague, finger pointing is a very common phenomenon. 11. Feedback sickness - management will constantly take feedback from diff employees working in your team, if anyone gives wrong feedback; that will not be communicated back to you, instead it will be used against u. 12. Employees in most teams are impatient and hungry for growth. Verdict – Employees in this company have low self-respect and self-esteem."

Which has fostered a very ugly competitive and back-handed culture - with lack of trust a core problem throughout the UK, especially when dealing with US colleagues. - Lots of very talented people, from all aspects, Marketing, Product, and Sales have left the business, with their replacements (typically Graduates) lacking the basic skills."

All these layers are forecasting to each other and it just seems to fuel the micromanagement activity and meetings for the sake of meetings culture. - Managers only care about their team number and really don't care about how you are doing individually. Leads to micromanagement when the team isn't doing well. If you are doing well, there's no real incentive for you to do better for the sake of the team, it's just what your manager wants. - Territories and verticals are very uneven. Best territories given to more tenured AEs which happens in a lot of companies, but makes your first year difficult to succeed without some luck. - Really not much culture day to day. There are team dinners and days out but not much is done to create a sense of fun in the job itself. This was the same even in the office. - No recognition outside of $ closed. - Apart from one or two, the product specialists only seem to want to help when your deal is about to close."

7253,"Applicable only to India team and for the time period this review is written for, - Non technical, director with no salesforce certification and poor knowledge of salesforce products and business. - The above makes this individual a poor leader for a technical team. Under this leadership, the India team has a sluggish growth to their careers. - Unrealistic targets and workloads are set for the team which led to long working hours and high pressure high stress work environment. - Work done here is boring, low impact and repetitive. There was no career defining work in this team for the time this review was written. - Management is a bully, openly threatening and humiliating team mates. Several incidents of this have occurred. But employees are too frightened of retaliation to bring out the issue. - Top down policies and decisions. Team mates have no voice and have to follow all decision leadership makes. - High stress environment created by an autocratic leadership. - Team is expected to work long hours and weekends. - Team are heavily monitored and micromanaged. Egs if you do not clock in by 9 am you will be called out in an email, in a public meeting and reported to HR. - Management is indifferent to creating career growth paths for its team members who do not want to become Solution Engineers. - Limited slow promotions, terrible hikes and highly gated pathways for internal transfer. Management claims that Demo Engineers are highly regarded in the company, yet demo engineers are not top choice for internal transfers, in India. - The leadership of India team creates unofficial policies that are against the overall organisation policies. Examples are non-reimbursement of failed attempts at certification. Use of whatsapp as an official communication channel, tho it is explicitly banned by salesforce. - Skip levels are highly discouraged. These are a threat to India management, in case of whistleblowers."

This was my dream company, so obviously when I received an offer from them, I accepted it, even if it meant taking a huge pay cut. These guys would leverage Salesforce US culture into talking you down for salaries but would say shamelessly that Salesforce has a transparent pay scale. When I entered the company, I found out that I was the least paid employee in the team. Anyhoo, I accepted the offer and it was their turn to send laptop and other peripherals. Well they didn’t, their procurement team never replied, not on slack, not on calls, not anywhere and I had to bring senior management into this. Well after 15 days of joining, I had received the laptop but mind you even though you don’t have your company phone or company laptop, they’ll start evaluating your performance from day 1, because dude you are in Business Development. So you gotta be an Einstien and a God maybe to do 500 billion things at one time and managers even then would find a way to complain. They expect us to work for 10 hours every day, attend useless meetings, and work like a machine without taking a breath. And they’ll preach about the helping culture of Salesforce, lol. The AEs don’t respond on time, hell even the managers themselves don’t respond until you ping them again and again. And they want us to feel gratitude for the company bevause it pays salary. They have 0 empathy for their employees, they turn deaf ear to our problems. I am suffocating here but I can’t teach out to anyone because guess what everyone is the same. This is a typical employee exploiting company which has created a bubble of a good work culture. PS- this is just for India. I have some friends in the US team of Salesforce and they are having their best time."
7319,"Internal hire/promotions make less than external hires. Could be a big difference (Over 100k base - with accelerators/spiffs/bonuses it's worth over 300k difference in pay) Company is getting very big. The young start up, fast pace, and youthful vibe is gone. Lots of people from Oracle and white hair running the company. There are cliques. Usually between internal and external hires. Some management within Enterprise space power trip. Have massive egos. (Not all are like this as some are incredibly humble and well respected)"
7322,Unfortunately your success in sales is really dependent on your territory and timing of the customer. I personally was unlucky with the management as well due to a lot of changes.
7353,- Base salary for internal promotes is significantly lower so you’re effectively punished for staying with the company - Internal meetings & training keep increasing limiting time you can spend with customers - Drink the “kool aid” or risk being shunned - Growing targets with reduced territories - Local leadership are useless and have no authority to action anything. Always go via the US it’s laughable - Workplace bullying and micromanagement is common - Bureaucracy is out of control. Nothing can be done without a form going through a chain of command via 10 people which seems ironic given the who product value proposition is to promote simplicity and automation.
7357,"Salary is under the tech industry avg in Ireland. Left after two years, I feel like the whole environment became much more hostile towards employees. At the beginning there was more learning space, career advancement expectations and good management, but I think the company lost track of the value of the employees lately and they are experiencing high attrition rates as a consequence. No space to express opinions and suggest improvements, some markets are restructured and there is no easiness of communication. Most of the colleagues who started with me left for better opportunities in terms of salary and benefit. HR is very slow at replying and they closed the main Public (internal) channel of communication- I guess because there were too many complaints to take care of. Management is often disorganized and issues are solved slowly if ever, resulting in frustration for the employees and possibly financial and work balance consequences. Satisfaction surveys are often handled out but results are not taken into account- or at least that’s what seems like. Some teams were asked to disclose if they undertake interviews with other companies. No clear vision to go back to office and giving reassurance to teams."
7358,"Salesforce is a great company, But not the Hyderabad support management. Especially the Hyderabad APAC MC premier Management. There are so many unethical things happening. Trust and equality are one of the core values of Salesforce, But it seems APAC MC premier Management doesn't care these core values. There is no equality shown in terms of work, The management shows partiality and allow their favourites to take easy case/work they want and put pressures on others."
7390,Terrible management Terrible recruitment process People who don't care about you as a person KPIs too difficult to reach Group KPIs effecting a large portion of your pay
7405,Constantly changing management can be hard to achieve results in a short-term.

7446,Senior management have a poor understanding of what happens on the ground
7452,"Mean girl clique - if you're not in the 'in group' and interested in always telling everyone how great you are and what wonderful thing you're taking credit for that someone else did...well, you're no-one. So many tiers of management, so many VPs and SVPs trying to justify whey they're there, it just gets exhausting. You can't quite see the termites, but the underlying rot has set in and been reinforced by all of the Oracle and Microsoft intake. The 'leaders' love talking about 'who they are as a leader (without seeming to understand you're only a leader if someone wants to follow you through choice, not reporting line). Talk of values is kind of funny - everyone loves to tell you what their values are, but ask them what that looks like when they're 'living their values' and they all pretty much draw a blank..."
7491,-No time to enjoy the perks -Lots of pressure from management who don’t take the time to figure out why teams aren’t performing -Poor work like balance -Poor support from management -Employee surveys are not anonymous
7492,"Another tech giant trying to spread the company culture kool aid but doesn’t recognize or address terrible leaders and managers or self appointed “lead EAs”. Very toxic, backstabbing politics going on amongst executive assistants which creates an entire group of disgruntled, distrustful, and power hungry EAs and makes most EAs carry a bad reputation at Salesforce. Execs and managers who have EAs: some of them need serious management training and learn how to treat everyone under them fairly. This was by far some of the worst treatment I’ve ever seen from an exec who had an EA. Micromanaging, having other people spy on the EA and report back to him about the EA's whereabouts and movement.. The EA was treated like a prisoner. Also, there are some EAs who support C-level people and they act as if they are the exec's themselves. They wield their execs' status for their own power and control over others. It's ridiculous and I don't know if the execs who have EAs even know that their EAs are doing this. I hated working with any execs who had EAs. It was always a massive hinderance to my work progress. I don't understand Salesforce and the EA culture.. some are really great EAs but some are terrible and unfortunately they are the EAs at the top.. usually supporting SVP and up. I wouldn’t buy into their culturally appropriated “OHANA” and other Hawaiian sayings. It’s all a facade."
7498,The management can be a bit strict with PTO
7500,"your success is predetermined by your territory, timing, and talent (in that order) you can often feel like just a number in the company versus management honestly caring about you, your goals and your well being not often transparent about the future of your career path unrealistic expectations with unattainable monthly quota metrics (only ~20% hit their annual quota)"
7509,"* Yelled at for seeing Doctor while employed * Scheduled Vacation Prior to Initiating Employment, later yelled at for being on leave when we had previously scheduled * Massive Manipulation and Lying * Use of Sexual Innuendo to Manipulate in Sales * Constant Changing of Hours and Needs making home life and commuting unbearable * Management Yelling in Conference Rooms * Inpatient Colleagues who disconnect calls while on phones with clients * Talking to other colleagues is very frowned on in other departments * Absolutely no bad talk allowed of company anywhere, despite the difficulties you will be fired if any word of a complaint is uttered. * Constant Stream of people coming and going. Definite preference for young people. * Forced Signing of Documents due to duress. * Use and training given to management on guilt shamming and utilizing coworkers to destroy team members. * Very little severance to compensate for medical issues associated with employment."
7511,"Poor middle management, managers need to be trained, sorely lacks diversity although posters show otherwise. Sadly another tech company run by white and Indian men and white women."
7513,Sometime management don't know the ground reality
7515,The Chicago office is extremely competitive. They make you feel as if you’re going to be hired and they kick you out the door. Unfortunate. The employees are great but the management is awful. This program really needs to redo their management.
7523,"While there are some down times, its not uncommon for me to work 10+ hours a day and into the weekends with travel (more normally 1x/week but sometimes 2x/week). With our diverse product set, the list of what a CORE SE is supposed to know grows constantly with insufficient specialist support. I'm a high performer in terms of ACV, but since our comp is more weighted towards team goals I'd rather have a life than have the extra few bucks. I've been asking for help all year, but hiring hasn't kept up with attrition on the team so its getting worse rather than better. I think management does care, but it takes so long to hire and onboard new SEs it takes 3-6 months to get any relief. The promotion process is murky, leaving me wondering if its even worth it to do this. The company says it cares about health and wellness, but Sales is a company within a company with its own culture. In that culture ACV > everything."
7542,"People management is very bad... There is massive title inflation. 0-1 year of experience managing people marks most directors, and even many senior directors. There is a serious problem of cronyism in many departments. VPs promote who they want, when they want irrespective of team feedback or even despite what are believed to be established policies. VP-level leadership exhibits schizophrenic decision making, CYA behaviors and abrasive comportment. This makes for highly stressful working environments and is a key cause of the well-known burnout at Salesforce. Many leaders at Salesforce have never done a job this big before which can lend to insecurity and erratic or absent decision making. Reorganizations are painfully frequent which also promotes insecurity & stress."
7544,"Politics and egos are rampant and get in the way of getting things done and feeling a sense of accomplishment. Constantly changing priorities combined with ever growing silo'd thinking/execution can impact job satisfaction. Extremely poor management practices due to new/inexperienced managers, managers with egos who don't understand how to lead a ""team"" to success, and downright unethical behavior with HR turning a blind eye. If you're lucky to get a good manager - someone who advocates for you, highlights your work, and ensures their success through the success of their team - hold on for dear life!"
7548,"Boiler room mentality, customer success is more of marketing-Customers are harassed constantly to keep up with monthly close and cadence.No long term strategy in enterprise accounts and customers are getting fatigued by this behaviour-Micro managment who only care about monthly ACV in Strategic accounts -High turnover in upper end of strategic sales.-Terrible mid level management who manage based on fear over mid 40s experienced sales team for Carolinas and Atlanta-No work life balance"
7554,"- Work life balance is terrible - They took the alcohol away because they hire alcoholics - Everything is a snowflake and not scalable (they will eventually figure this out and it will hurt when it matters) - Incompetent management (mid and senior level - how are these people getting hired/promoted?) - Too much management so nothing actually gets done - CAB/change management is incompetent - Dev does not seem to know how to make their products stable or supportable - Infrastructure does not seem to know how to make their environments stable - Meetings (let's have a meeting about a meeting and we will schedule a meeting to discuss the meeting) - Internal Salesforce recruiting/hiring is worthless - Indy Tower move provides no benefit to employees and worsens work life balance - Commute worse now since the move to the ivory tower - Pay for your own parking (penalized for not living in the city) - No real room for growth within Marketing Cloud for SREs - Worst career decision I have made from a skill set perspective (no marketable skill set growth outside of the company) - Company liberal agenda constantly shoved down your throat - Employees placed into a silo - Mandatory holiday work for Marketing Cloud so other companies can send more spam to people who do not want it - SRE team mandatory weekly on call rotation recently went from 4 weeks/year to 15 weeks/year (yes, seriously, and that is the main reason I quit Salesforce for a real #dreamjob elsewhere) - The company itself provides no real benefit to society so they allow employees to volunteer to feel fulfilled on the inside but really it is thinly veiled attempt at marketing and promotion of the company - Stressful workplace - Job titles are made up - Open office concept is detrimental to productivity and health in general - Cult feeling with all the internal lingo - Ridiculous amount of money spent on unnecessary things but then they take away the small amount of money they contributed to parking costs which is a necessity - Giant corporation now... culture cannot keep up with acquisitions. News flash: people are different in different parts of the country and the rest of the world. Company needs to just admit they are the same as other giant corporations. - No longer feels like a innovative/entrepreneurial/start-up company (Now we just buy those kinds of companies, even if it doesn't make sense. I'm looking at you Quip.) - The company has never told a customer no, even when they needed to do so and the company is feeling it - Company seems to reward bad client behavior instead of correcting it - I am tired of typing but there are definitely more cons than pros"
7562,"New AE product enablement is embarrassingly bad. The first 12 months are sink or swim, and aside from self-enabling yourself, the territories are hit or miss. Sales reps that have crushed their quota at other companies often struggle due to poor territory carves and slow enablement ramp time. Furthermore, Marketing Cloud basically acts as its own company within Salesforce. Collaboration with the CRM business is weak at best, and Marketing Cloud's biggest competitor has been its own internal solution, Pardot. Last, sales managers here are mostly just that, managers. True leaders in management are few and far between. For example, struggling AEs are mostly on their own to figure it out, which is resulting in higher AE turnover."
7563,"Management is full of hyprocrisy. Salesforce's core values include things like transparency and equality, both of which have been completely ignored on our team (and apparently also on other teams after reading other reviews here). There is a complete lack of communication from the top down, which makes our team unable to perform our work well. Furthermore, there is little feedback on how we can get promotions or raises. There is a culture of not giving feedback and you need to ""read between the lines"" in order to know what feedback there is (this is what was told to me by management). On our team, promotions are given to the men more often than the women, and men with the same title and less experience as women have higher salaries. Also, the skill of managing people isn't seen as part of the requirements of being a people manager. A lot of people who are great individual contributors get promoted to Manager and aren't very good at their new job of dealing with their direct reports, but upper management doesn't care. Work life balance is also not very flexible during busy season (which lasts from October through March)."
7569,Huge variation in talent and leveling due to fast growth - opportunity for fast growth has now slowed and is determined more on time in role than talent. Managers often are tough - have had little people management training. Marketing plays backseat to sales in the organization.
7590,"I had a very bad manager who harassed me mentally everyday till I left the company. No support for an employee from the HR. Manager went to a point to insult me in various 1-1s. No exit interview, no one to talk to if you are being casted out since managers and senior management is all a big group of friends who cant be touched."
7593,lack of middle management training
7601,"You are truly just a number, and are very easily replaced. If you aren't a favorite of upper management (which is based solely on the number of hires you make a quarter, and nothing else whatsoever), you cannot succeed here. Salesforce claims to be the best company to work for, and from a birds eye view it is. But what they don't tell you about is the amount of politics, favoritism, back-stabbing, and lack of empathy from management and above."
7602,"Salesforce is the most toxic organization I have ever worked for, and I've worked for a lot of organizations as both an FTE, contractor, and consultant over the past two decades. Trying to pare down what I want to warn others of is difficult. I'll just bullet it out and you can decide what would wear you down, disrupt your sleep, and leave you paranoid, the most. - 1:1s with senior management where the most hateful things are said about your character, etc., and then afterward, the manager acts as though it never happened. -Pressure to give Salesforce a glowing Glassdoor rating after less than 30 days at the company when you do not know enough to provide an accurate review. - No written reviews, something called a 9 box where management provides their opinion of you and tells you it exists but then says you are never allowed to see it, per H/R. - If you want to apply for an internal position, you must have your manager's permission first. If you tell your manager you want to apply for the role and he/she does not want to lose you, he/she just says, no, you do not have my permission. Game over, you are going no where. - If you are allowed a desk (many have to submit to hoteling and never knowing where they will sit day to day), no personal plants, photos, or non SF toys allowed. They want a uniform look to the desks. -Forced volunteerism, if you do not log your 50 hour minimum of volunteer hours per year, you will be shamed at team meetings. Doesn't matter if you have kids, sick parents, 60 hour work week, whatever, you are expected to make the minimum. -No criticism of Benioff permitted. And don't ever say out loud that you found it disturbing to see a laying on of hands and someone praying over him as though he were a prophet at an internal company meeting. Management will quickly remind you that he is leading the 4th industrial revolution and he is the leading mind of our time. -If you are managing young hourly employees, be prepared to be instructed that you are to tell them they MUST go to team dinners, volunteer events, and SF ""fun"" activities but this is not work, so they don't get paid. If you push back, you will be reprimanded for ""not being Ohana."" - Teams are run by popularity. Backstabbing, shaming, and shunning are used to get the teams to stay quiet about how bad things are. People who speak out about behaviors, lack of professionalism, etc. are labeled, ""unOhana"" and told that they are not acting like family. - When you interview and you take a position, there is ZERO guarantee that the role you interviewed for and were hired for is the role you will be doing. The management opinion is to hire highly qualified people, they will be so grateful to be permitted to work at Salesforce, they will do whatever job we give them. I kid you not, you may have more than a decade of experience, be highly technical, have managed teams, and be hired for a technical role, then be told you are going to do data entry level work and you will be glad you are permitted to be at this company doing that. -If you are uncomfortable participating in some public events, e.g. parades, events, etc., and SF is participating in one, there is incredible pressure to spend your weekend in the parade or event. The expectation is that Salesforce and its needs come first. I cannot stress this enough, you are told that Salesforce is YOUR family and your family comes first. A lack of loyalty to the company will get penalized far more significantly and quicker than complete incompetence, maliciousness, or even harassment. Salesforce demands absolute devotion."
7603,"Disconnects between product management and engineering that are impactful to delivery speed and quality, 24/7 international business (pro and con) which makes work/life balance something that must be very well looked after."
7610,"- Racism is prevalent everywhere. Unless you speak Hindi or are a South Indian, white male, expect no growth. They speak Hindi in meetings, and are not inclusive at all to others outside this group - Liars. They won't tell you the real function of the job. They claim to be great at tech, but its all very outdated technology. It moves very slowly, so don't expect to work on anything new while at Salesforce - Absent management. Managers are never around and they won't help. They are also racist if they are South Indian. They choose to talk only to others on the team of the same race as them and only promote those individuals - Your work will be stolen by more senior engineers and management won't side with you. The Indian engineers will take your ideas or overwrite your commits and claim they did it. This happened a good amount of times"
7620,-Incompetent people with titles as 'research scientist' and 'research engineers' -You would instantly lose attraction to companies like Google/Facebook/Apple/Amazon if you go here. Common perception is that they hire lazy low-tier engineers/scientist -Many of the 'researchers/research scientists' do not even have a PhD. They are students/friends of the people in management who hire them without rigorous interviews - You won't learn anything since there is no innovation going on here. This will be problematic if you try to get a job at a real company and they ask you about your past experience.
7629,"* Slow to match industry standards for technology frameworks and practices * Delayed longterm plans for the above, or rushed approaches that results in a company-wide approach with too many gaps to support many teams' needs * My specific cloud is typically under-resourced and people often move between teams to fulfill needs * My specific cloud also operates on a slower release schedule (3x a year) * Some management and employees can be quite immature/unprofessional"
7644,"Middle management are in capable of leading the team. All they care about about is manage upward. My colleague was promoted to my manager and I found out that he listed down my work in his achievement list. What a joke. Besides that, he was trying to get a replacement for my pier and every candidate he shortlisted were Indian. Both external and internal OOM candidates. Downright racist."
7651,Promotion consistency Career opportunities Ability to take time off and disconnect (great PTO benefit though) General disconnect of senior management from overall department and day-to-day responsibilities
7652,"Too much politics in teams as they try to prove. They don't let people do their work. Instead put pressure on them for unnecessary reasons. If you can suck up to your manager you can get all your perks. Some teams to prove themselves, try to step in other teams projects and take over and send them out. Some managers think their reports should work like their servants and should not express their opinion, too much partiality. When teams move under different managers, this becomes rampant. Managers from certain ethnicity have very less opinion on women workers. Have seen several emotional incidents several times. I am sure this is going to become big in coming days as SFDC is becoming a giant. Not many women workers in management positions. Sr. Mgmt is worse as they don't know technical issues at all. Sincere people struggle at times trying to keep their positions."

They tell you to pat yourself on the back because ""its harder to get into Salesforce than Harvard""... people repeat this at bootcamp, when they didn't even attend Harvard. Training is all online Trailhead badges, and not personal training with objection handling, interaction and just a bunch of ""Salesforce is the best and the competitor sucks"", their management and team breeds arrogance, ignorance and lack of humanity. Salesforce is all smoke and mirrors, great place to work, but their sales teams all stab eachother in the back. Try asking people about the relationships between EMEA and NorthAmerica on accounts. They claim #1 place to work but ask around, people get sick of being a cog in the corporate system. Salesforce is great marketers but peel back the onion, on integrating the clouds."
7678,"big company, bottom down management"
7691,"Where do I begin.... *pay is a joke compared to other large SaaS and tech companies. Even if you hit quota, which by the way barely happens. Please, please, please, don’t believe the hype. Less than 20 % of the people hit quota. I think in GRB it’s less than 10% for 2017. Regardless it’s a joke. I’ve worked at other tech companies and I’ve never seem anything so pathetic. *terrible middle management, I mean terrible. Keep in mind this review is coming from someone who was cosidered realtively succssful, and still think this place is a joke. Anyways, I digress.... Middle management for the most part is made up of people who lack leadership skills, talent, experience. It’s actually joke. It’s like a weird cesspool of account executives being promoted to management. One day theyre your peer, the next day, they’re your superior. Not saying they’re racist or anything, but holy hell, talk about 95% Caucasians Being promoted into these roles. Overall, management (based on my experience, observations, talking to peers,etc) literally brings NO value. They just sit at their computer and run reports, show up late to customer meetings, sit awkwardly/quietly in a conference room during a customer call, but during 1on1s (these are also frequent, redundant, waste of time), they offer to sit in on calls/meetings as if They are providing value. If you’re one of the unfortunate suckers/victims to work for Salesforce please please please understand, your entire success, compensation, will be 99% based on the territory handed to you. That’s it point blank. All the other BS, is Just that BS. Run a few reports and you’ll see the top performs get most of their ACV from organic aka gimmes or flips aka warm leads handed to them by the inside biz dev team. Team. Yes, working hard and doing everything the right way (by the book) will give you a very slight edge, but if you’re not handed a fruitful territory you WILL NOT hit quota or make money. Pleeeeasse, please take this as the truth. Again, I was a top 10-20% person, and I’m leaving this review. I could go on and on, but I’ll end it with this. If you’re an experienced sales professional, do NOT work here. You will regret it and regret it fast. If you’re a developer/coder then Salesforce might be a legit landing spot, otherwise look elsewhere."
7711,"Losing sight of the core values the company was founded on. Growing to fast and not able to keep up with overall growth. Seeing lots and lots of angry current customers... 8/10 if you don't have 5-6+ years of inside/outside sales experience, you will only be considered for an SDR or BDR role. This could be fine, but the role should incorporate more closing of business if you are basically expecting people to take a demotion for the role and not articulating the position clearly (this could just be an issue with my office though). If you are on the BDR team you can be the hardest working person and still not hit your number because of how your quota is attained. Your manager will ""help you"" come up with ""strategic plans"" to hit your number (basically just tell you to make more calls/set meetings) but it doesn't matter because if you AEs refuse the meetings, don't feel like moving them to a stage 2 (everyone perceives what this means differently), don't have time to take them until the next month, etc. then you are screwed. BDR management doesn't align with AE management at all. Therefore, they don't care about anything except their AEs closing deals (I don't blame them!), they are annoyed when BDR management comes complaining that their AEs aren't working with their BDR... This is just not a conducive business model and doesn't help growth initiatives. Not everyone is measured the same. You could be aligned 2-4 AEs or 10-15 AEs as a BDR. Either way, these people are expected to generate the same amount of ""stage 2"" opportunity. If you have 2 AEs that are busy, don't work in your office or don't have the ""need"" for a BDR to generate pipeline - then you have NO chance of hitting your quota. SDRs, BDRs and AE's are all expected to generate their own pipeline - which makes sense but it is causing people to compete with each other which takes away from making the customer #1 priority. This is especially bad since the Mulesoft migration... (from BDR POV) Although Salesforce always talks about endless internal growth opportunities, this is def not something that I have seen to be encouraged. You are pretty much forced to take the typical promotion track. BDR Management is way too pushy with BDRs setting new meetings and business, while this should be a significant responsibility, lots of customers get mislead, forgotten, or treated with poor customer service which eventually will backfire (I have already seen it backfire a few times!) As a BDR you could generate $5mil in the pipeline one month, but only have 2 stage two opptys on the board (you need around 6-8)...which means you will miss your quota. Others could have 6-8 opptys on the board which only adds up to $300k in pipe for the month, but they will hit quota.. Doesn't make sense."
7719,"- Management can be awful and unregulated. Discrimination occurs and they say it wasn’t intentional so it’s okay - Keep your head down and mouth shut. Aim to fly under the radar, and stay middle of the pack. If you over perform you may be punished just as much if not worse than if you under perform - overworked and underpaid. Do not expect work life balance. - Claim they pay hourly including overtime, but management often caps hour submission at a certain level. Therefore, don’t expect to get paid for all the hours you actually work. - don’t anticipate management to help or coach you - culture seems very dependent on your location, rely on culture reviews accordingly. - Big push for monthly quotas, yet told by tenure employees almost 60% of business done in the last quarter. Set expectations wisely."

But again, that can change without much notice since re-orgs happen every 3 months. Think before you join. Not bad to get it on resume then move on"
7796,Poor management. Lots of growing pains.
7802,"If your boss is difficult, upper management won't care"
7808,"Transitioning from start-up to big corporation, execs are young and eager to please parent company in Cali by kissing up while transferring the stress to employees. Zero tolerance for mistakes but not giving any warning sign until the last minute before they fire you. Due to poor location excellent employees are few and far between, so mediocre but ass-kissing people get to stay. Managers are all great players of politics. Employees don't dare to speak their mind just to keep their jobs in the ""best"" company of the area. Mid-level people managers have no clue in managing so resort to micromanagement. Typical ""boys club"" culture with no advancement opportunity for female. Only those who play well with their managers and drink the Salesforce cool-aid will thrive. The V2MOM is a joke as performance review has nothing to do with it, meaning delivering results doesn't mean you are good enough. Fear of mistakes and risk averse mindset is suffocating the humanity and innovation this company once had."
7824,"Only a fraction of enterprise reps make their number..if you're a great rep and you work hard you still only have a one in six chance of making your number. Accounts are dolled out like it's the Wild West. Managers pick their favorite rep and assign the best accounts.. Even if your lucky enough to get good accounts (which I was)there are so many reps you will only get 2-3 active accounts. It's also a micro management, Oracle environment... The beatings will continue until morale improves.. Attrition is really, really high. Do yourself a favor and look elsewhere."
7832,Layers of management and a pecking order to move up
7835,"Micromanagement, poor leadership. Complete shift in culture over the past couple years. After the acquisition everything went downhill."
7838,"Salesforce has over 15k employees, about 90% of them are sales guys, which I can not speak for. For R&D: 1. Hiring standards has been deteriorating day by day. We used to be really great at it, but now we are hiring people blindly. If we are to maintain the quality, we need to standardize the process, and learn from top tech companies(as we claim to be one). We pay pretty well compared to top tech firms in bay area, and I am sure with right interview process and effort from recruiters(hire more recruiters and tell them to reach out to everyone), we should we able to hire great engineers. 2. We have too many titles in R&D, this is great to keep employees motivated and promote them and I get that. BUT, you got to respect the title. I have seen people with very less experience and contributions, becoming Principle Engineers. I bet, these so called Principle Engineers, wont be able to pass entry level engineer's interview at a good tech company. PLEASE FIX THIS. 3. Another thing which is hurting the quality of engineering organization is letting QAs move to development without any interviews. I agree with the idea of allowing people to move between roles and do different things, but we must maintain the same interview standards while doing so. We all know that hiring standards for dev and QA are far apart, then letting QAs move to dev so easily has become a shortcut and no one is getting benefitted by this other than the individual. This hurts both dev team (as now they have to explain every line of code to QA) and it also hurts QA team as they will always have to hire new QAs (since the existing ones become dev) 4. I am not sure if this is salesforce or recruiters, but they dont give you good equity if you dont negotiate hard. The equity I have seen so far is around 50% of what a tech company in bay area (at our level) offers. 5. We have a great work culture at company, which is getting polluted by more and more higher management coming from Microsoft and Oracle. I always wonder, why we never get higher management from companies we admire (Google, Facebook, LinkedIn....). Now, these new managers are polluting the culture by thier micromanagement philosophy of earliest companies. For instance, now managers are asking receipt for $7 lunch arranged for a team meeting. This is not salesforce."
7851,But middle management spoiling the culture created by top management. Middle management seems to fight with each other for wrong reasons. Company has grown big and the middle management does not know how to handle it. Re-orgs happens without a reason and the new management whoever joins tend to shakes good amount of teams without knowing what they are upto and how it will impact the company and individuals. No clear communication on the changes and re-orgs.
7854,"If you're stuck with a terrible manager, you're screwed. Changes come from management down, not from employees upward. Performance reviews can be quite subjective...."
7855,Having more seasoned management to aid with change management would make it better.
7866,"Poor management. They provide very little direction and expect you to work with 100% accuracy. When there are mistakes, management points the finger to everyone else."
7876,"Would love to have some additional management training, but the one-on-one attention you get from leadership fills a lot of the gaps."
7886,The free snacks can challenge weight management.
7907,Sr management is off offf off
7940,Huge variation in talent and leveling due to fast growth - opportunity for fast growth has now slowed and is determined more on time in role than talent. Managers often are tough - have had little people management training. Marketing plays backseat to sales in the organization.
7950,"Products department has become extremely political. It's a shark tank with big battles over budget. No incentive for cross-product collaboration. Many managers only managing up while beating down their teams. Hard core HR culture from Oracle has seeped into Salesforce, so HR is purely on management's side and by no means neutral."
7955,"Poor management is pervasive. Lack of leadership and commitment to big ideas creates gross inefficiencies, unclear expectations, and conflicting outcomes. Overly headquarter-centric in politics. The maintain an institutional arrogance that disrespects their competitors and creates overly idealistic strategies. Executive leadership tends to believe things get done because they want them to get done, without providing communication, support, or transparency in decisions."
7957,poor middle management cronyism huge culture shift and growing pains; company has become a mini-Oracle haves and have-nots in sales
7978,Shrinking territories and increased quotas. Monthly cadence and unrealistic expectations from lower management. Focus is on monthly deals and not long term strategic relationships outside of the enterprise group. Closing deals is more important that happy clients.
7985,"As with any big company, the team you are on can drastically change your experience here but I am going to try to point out some of the general things. Also of note, before you read too much into the other reviews, take the time to notice how many of the 5 star reviews are can be summed up by ""great place to work but has growing pains"" or ""you get what you put in, slackers need not apply"". I will let you draw your own conclusion on why so many of these reviews sound like marketing message .... It doesnt look like ExactTarget understands that they are no longer a startup. The only people that thrive at ExactTarget are people that have no lives. 50+ hours of work a week is the norm and anyone that does less is considered a ""slacker"" as you might have seen in some of these other reviews. If you do the math, you'll realize that the decent paycheck, which is typically higher than the industry norm, ultimately falls woefully short when you look at how much you make an hour. As you work here, you come to find out that it is very much a cult mindset and you are either in or out. Job security comes from owning tribal knowledge of projects that are integrated in to the platform since documentation is apparently a running joke. There are many processes that have been implemented to ""streamline"" development but apparently the management style here is to implement ""solutions"" and ignore the results because the only thing that these processes have done is add one more point of failure to an already broken system. Contractors are treated as second class citizens. Its common knowledge. The way to get ahead is to brown nose and give up on life outside work. ET is founded on the principle that the reward for a job well done is an opportunity to do more. After the Salesforce acquisition morale and productivity have been at an all time low while frustrations and turn over have been on the other side of the scale."
8004,"There is a culture of sexual harassment within Sales and Marketing. It seems to be tacitly approved by management, so women don't bother to report it and male executives treat this place like a playground on which to prey on young women. Makes it hard to do your job well."
8006,"For being a tech company, this place could not keep anyone in IT for longer than 2 years, it seemed. Salesforce has a ridiculous hierarchy that is rather militant in the way it handles internal communications (""My door is always open; however, you better not come to me before person a, b, c, and d""). There is 0 transparency although they preach this in every pointless meeting they make you sit through. This company caters heavily to the Sales side of business, and no where else. If you are IT in any sense of that side of business, then you can expect to be held to your best performing day for your entire career no matter how much of an outlier that day was, if you prove to be competent with what you do you can expect to be overloaded with work enough for those who are not, and then held to their expectations on top of your own. Oh, and those people will get promoted before you, because you are too ""valuable"" to move from your spot. And you can never expect to hear what you do right; every 1:1 you have with management is everything that you could possibly be doing better, always. No thanks, no 'atta-boys, nothing. You think you have co-workers in other departments? The people you assist are your companies User's that you support? Maybe these co-workers/users are your future friends/buddies? No. You have customers. And you treat them as such at all times. Your co-workers for the first few months of being hired are pretty great typically, until the vibe of this company is finally realized; which leads them into the cutthroat, every (wo)man for his/herself environment that management breeds. As a cherry on the top; Salesforce has this underlying community called femmeforce. Now this could be innocent, and it could potentially do a lot of great things; however this is not what it is being used for and many of the current management are women who are extremely active in this community for the wrong reasons. In our office 90% of the people who are leaving/being bullied out are male, and 70-80% of the new hires are women. The obvious preferential treatment, and the lack of others who care enough to do anything about it is ulimately why I left this company. I performed in the top 5 of a 40+ member team consistently across all stats; closures, professionalism, ""customer"" satisfaction, SLA; however, I was still offered an ultimatum: a severance package that is really hard to look away from, or the promise of an official write up that would not go the way I wanted, just because I was male working under a radical feminist. That is not a joke, and not an exaggeration."
8013,"The top level management like directors , program managers are pretty immature and behave unprofessionally. They poke their nose in matters where they are not supposed to. Obvious they dont have lot of work to do and just jump in every meeting and talk nonsense.Consulting for salesforce has been painful. They have irrelevant personal conversations in the meetings which annoys consultants from other firms. Still they are behaving like a start up company and never being matured. The height of immaturity is when they make fun of other company's boss and consultants right in front of them."
8018,"Little room for advancement in some of the sub-clouds, unless you worked at whatever company got acquired to create that cloud. Can be hard to move up or onto different teams of your own volition. Constant reorganizations of mid-level management make it hard to get established as a newer employee."
8038,Lack of vision to push through large infra projects at the senior management level
8045,"Over the last year or so, there is an influx of people from a certain software behemoth. While it is understood that any leadership change will bring with it a new paradigm, I do believe that sometimes people are given more importance than people that have built the systems and been hugely successful, just because they come from a certain company. As a consequence, sometimes, either attrition of domain experts is high or there are growing signs of disapproval with how the management thinks."
8069,"Salesforce talks about the aloha spirit and embracing all new employees from acquired companies. This is not the case. Salesforce disrespected me as a member of the existing management team during our acquisition time, but they had no issues in demanding an excessive amount of my time for information during the acquisition process."
8115,"Comp plans reward AE's, SE's not so much. High growth causes issues with quality of mid level management HQ/SF focus, remote employees seem to have a harder path to success Incredible title inflation, over thousand+ VPs Co-prime bus rolling into complex deals creates competing goals Need to proactively manage your career or you may get run over."
8121,"* Slow to match industry standards for technology frameworks and practices * Delayed longterm plans for the above, or rushed approaches that results in a company-wide approach with too many gaps to support many teams' needs * My specific cloud is typically under-resourced and people often move between teams to fulfill needs * My specific cloud also operates on a slower release schedule (3x a year) * Some management and employees can be quite immature/unprofessional"
8139,">> Data people (analysts, scientists, engineers) aren't given enough time or bandwidth by middle management to keep skills up to date. In other words, the best data talent that comes to this company sticks around for a year or two then leaves >> If you are a data person coming to Salesforce ... buckle up and get ready to solve SALESFORCE problems, not data science problems >> Data teams are super siloed and do not work together across orgs. This feels like a huge lost opportunity >> Tech is second to Sales at Salesforce. You aren't on the same pedestal you would be at other FAANG companies >> Data science infrastructure for some teams is surprisingly awful for what is supposed to be a tech company"
8144,"SALESFORCE no cons to working here, OLD company my old job was at a sunnyvale EHR startup and they have a repressive culture, long hours, low pay and bad culture with micromanagement"
8156,"- as with any large company, your experience will really be dictated by your manager - your success is more dependent on who you know / how long you've been at the company versus performance and potential - disconnect b/w upper management and average employee"
8159,"Tends to move slow in order to get things shipped. Top-level management and sales oriented culture, does not optimize for engineering."
8166,"Company is imploding. The 3-4% annual merit raises aren’t good enough. Existing employee salaries are sub-par. No RSUs or stocks given to employees anymore. Incentivization by pay is a distant dream. Management and upper management take the meat of the money - typical of any company getting avaricious. Heavy attrition in critical functions is chipping away at all levels. Politics and power grab is the main game and not quality of work. Nepotism, favoritism is definitely on the rise. Transparency is questionable."
8181,"After my long tenure and many Dreamforce conferences, I'm nearly fried. To say the culture is fast paced and the focus is always changing is an understatement. The reason Salesforce always seems on top, and chasing the latest trend, and in the press, is because employees are expected to run harder, carry more, cheer loudly, and pivot constantly. It's the world's biggest startup in behavior. But at the same time, with the recent influx of top career sales leaders from Oracle and what appears to be a board-level mandate for doubling revenue, employees are being asked to do even more with even less, fill higher quotas with smaller territories, less help, and the big company bureaucracy is rearing it's ugly head. Worse still is the politics. When you hire a bunch of smart, aggressive people, and put them in an environment of outsized expectations, throw in a bunch of re-orgs and changing management, and sprinkle with uncertainty and constantly changing priorities, you inevitably get people back stabbing each other and throwing others under the bus to appear smarter and more worthy of promotion. The few at the top will get very, very rich. The rest will lose the sense of personal ownership and start to wonder why they've given up health and family"
8193,"Ohana, what Ohana? Management (at least in sales) only manages by the numbers, with no EQ to speak of, shuns 2-way dialogue, and pushes everything on the front line. They don't prioritize their requests and overwhelm their teams, who are trying to close business and/or appease unhappy customers. Meanwhile, there's zero knowledge management to speak of -- we are literally incessantly filling out shared docs with the same information multiple times outside of the CRM. and everyone on the account team loses the plot. Who would have thunk? Salesforce is cost cutting in an effort to reach profitability. Goodbye parties, offsites, and non customer-facing travel. Benefits aren't cheap -- I'm paying well over $400/mo. for mine. It's been observed that they are systematically pushing workers 40+ out of the business to hire less experienced / new grads for less -- a ""best practice"" of private equity companies that seems to be catching on like wildfire in tech. Last but not least, at a company that espouses the values that it does, I am surprised that so many offsite events and outings include a ridiculous amount of drinking. Not ONCE has our team done a group volunteering outing or something to serve our community (and I'm at HQ in San Francisco). Instead, every time I go out with my sales colleagues it turns into some weird game of chicken of who can drink the most and still function the next day. Honestly, it's pathetic. These aren't even 20 or early 30-somethings."
8224,Heavily sales-driven which can impact the culture to a degree and cause some political strife within the company. High turnover in account management and some struggles with customer service given recent acquisitions and finding alignment between all the companies
8227,I don't see much cons about this wonderful company. I wish the management continue supporting its employees the same way it does now.
8231,No diversity in sales- the website makes the company look diverse and it is not at all unfortunately Poor middle management that plays favorites and favors typical male frat boy. Toxic sales culture of people that constantly undercut one another. No one tries to help new employees and everyone is more concerned with making themselves look better and squeezing others out. So many red accounts and failed implementations!! I’ve never heard of such a thing! Constant change- I had 3 middle managers in one year!
8240,Promotion consistency Career opportunities Ability to take time off and disconnect (great PTO benefit though) General disconnect of senior management from overall department and day-to-day responsibilities
8242,"- Cronyism seeping in. Growth is tied to how much you suck up to your management - Disagreements while encouraged on the surface, are dealt with serious repercussions covertly - Work-life balance is eroding thanks to inept managers - Top-down directives to teams is demoralizing"
8252,Lied to about job expectations and performance during hiring/onboarding process upper-management focuses on making money rather than helping businesses My expectations we're very high when I accepted this role...now I wish I never did
8253,"That being said, the vision and values don't necessarily always translate down to middle management levels. Many orgs (specifically marketing, but I've heard sales as well) are full of politics, mud slinging and power grabs. Senior leadership seems to acknowledge this recently, however there are no consequences for the people that perpetuate this type of environment. Toxic employees who produce results in their job are protected, even when multiple complaints are surfaced through the appropriate channels."
8268,"Unfortunately as the company has grown exponentially, it has gotten that big company mentality and politics. From a sales standpoint, goals have become unreasonable and territories have shrunk ridiculously. Ask what percentage of the reps are making quota. I suspect company wide it is less than 25% but management would never say. Very hard to make money these days at SFDC. Voluntary turnover in 2013 was insane (sales reps). Leadership from Oracle coming over in herds pushing Oracle mentality...not good unless you like that kind of thing."
8271,"- If you come from an acquisition, Salesforce isn’t going to pay you as well as they pay their internal employees. Even if you are doing the same exact job as someone inside Salesforce, you will probably be making significantly less than what a core employee will be making. It was extremely frustrating and completely demeaning to hear all the hype and news about how Salesforce employees are so happy with their compensation and how Salesforce is making strides towards equal pay. Apparently, acquired company employees are not part of that equation and we do not hold as much value and shouldn’t be treated as equals…ridiculous. I asked for a compensation change in order to match or even come close to the pay of my peers within the Salesforce organization but was told that Salesforce does not have enough internal data to justify a compensation change. Essentially, there was no proof at Salesforce that I was worth a compensation change. This blew my mind because when you first hire someone, you have no proof internally that they are worth the salary that you are going to pay them. What you do instead is evaluate their past experiences and then you determine what is fair pay based on their experiences, skills, and the job that they are doing. You have no internal data or proof in that situation. If you acquire a company, yes, you have no Salesforce data to prove that an employee is worth a certain salary but you acquired a product that you clearly thought had value and the people who helped to create that product are not worth a compensation change because you don't have enough data? I had been working for the acquired company for almost a year, but all of that was meaningless because if you're acquired, it seems like you're not truly a ""Salesforce employee"" and being paid fairly is not something that applies to you. - Our entire acquisition process was a complete mess. My team and I essentially had to operate “as normal” which was completely impossible given that all of our management and the rest of the company were trying to figure out the acquisition themselves. We were lost in the transition, did not have managers for quite some time, and were essentially left to fend for ourselves for the better part of 4 months. It didn’t seem like the M&A team knew what to do with us and had forgotten we existed. - During the acquisition process, we were told that there would be tons of opportunities within the Salesforce organization but once we were in the Salesforce organization, in reality, there were no opportunities. We contacted departments and teams we were interested in and were repeatedly told that they were not hiring or that you needed XYZ experiences that none of us had. We had no choice in what department or role we were assigned. A role was thrown on us, whether we liked it or not, with no other presented opportunities. - My team and I were expected to hit ridiculous numbers as soon as we were acquired despite the fact that we were not fully integrated, did not receive the goal numbers until halfway through a quarter, and still had to facilitate the entire merging of all our systems with Salesforce's systems. We received very little support from the core Salesforce organization and were treated as if we were incompetent because we could not hit these numbers. It seemed like my team and I were being set up for failure so that the core team had a reason to get rid of us once we did not hit a specific goal."
8285,"Long hours, a lot of stress and although management keeps saying step away to re-charge, there is too much on to successfully step away"
8287,there are few exceptions to above pros in middle management
8325,"I used to work for Microsoft and Oracle. In comparison to them, SF is the worst... by far! The company (who claims their value is trust) employs managers who speak about their employees behind their back. The manager would cancel all the meetings I scheduled for us witout saying a word about it. Also, I heard him speaking about other people a coupld of times to find out later he did the same for me and my BDR in other meetings. That's all in terms of trust in practice. Also, for some regions, they push on selling and they have done zero market research. Therefore their product is not only worse than competitions, but also 10 times more expensive. Money as with other companies, but the amount of stress and mismanagement - not worth a month staying there!"
8334,Everything negative feels derivative of poor management practices. No career growth for individual contributors.
8336,- Base salary for internal promotes is significantly lower so you’re effectively punished for staying with the company - Internal meetings & training keep increasing limiting time you can spend with customers - Drink the “kool aid” or risk being shunned - Growing targets with reduced territories - Local leadership are useless and have no authority to action anything. Always go via the US it’s laughable - Workplace bullying and micromanagement is common - Bureaucracy is out of control. Nothing can be done without a form going through a chain of command via 10 people which seems ironic given the who product value proposition is to promote simplicity and automation.
8339,"Internal hire/promotions make less than external hires. Could be a big difference (Over 100k base - with accelerators/spiffs/bonuses it's worth over 300k difference in pay) Company is getting very big. The young start up, fast pace, and youthful vibe is gone. Lots of people from Oracle and white hair running the company. There are cliques. Usually between internal and external hires. Some management within Enterprise space power trip. Have massive egos. (Not all are like this as some are incredibly humble and well respected)"
8360,Too many management layers resulting in micromanagement Targets are way too challenging Work-life balance is off Very American legal procedures when dealing with EU customers Internal processes are a mess A lot of metrics in tracking AE activity
8372,"Corrupt , fraudulent and political middle management specially crm infra. Highly selfish ,incompetent and greedy. Work for their convenience. Good engineers suffer for the sake of management. Dumbs grow for the sake of management."
8432,"Micromanagement in biz dev, long promotion period"
8433,management becoming more and more like oracle sales don't follow process
8439,"Difficult to achieve targets, processes keep changing each year, lack of job security due to cuts to the success management team in early 2020, difficulty in retaining talent (due to changes each year), role has become less and less consultative and more and more ad-hoc servicing a various range of requests from stakeholders within the business and customers externally, it seems that the changes are always out of everyone's control"
8444,"Everyone in it for themselves So called Ohana is just a mega Propaganda thing Towards the outside company is promoted as this family thing Once you're in, you realise it's all just about the money, and everyone is just focusing on themselves Ego culture - Narcissistic upper management - nobody really interested in what's good for customers or employees Only very few make their targets High turnover of people in sales"
8452,"A lot of organisational politics in management, too many sales managers, directors and VPs, very top heavy."
8495,Horrible management Worst leadership Toxic culture Very political and unhealthy peers No proper training
8511,"Mean girl clique - if you're not in the 'in group' and interested in always telling everyone how great you are and what wonderful thing you're taking credit for that someone else did...well, you're no-one. So many tiers of management, so many VPs and SVPs trying to justify whey they're there, it just gets exhausting. You can't quite see the termites, but the underlying rot has set in and been reinforced by all of the Oracle and Microsoft intake. The 'leaders' love talking about 'who they are as a leader (without seeming to understand you're only a leader if someone wants to follow you through choice, not reporting line). Talk of values is kind of funny - everyone loves to tell you what their values are, but ask them what that looks like when they're 'living their values' and they all pretty much draw a blank..."
8516,"Sink or swim culture, little collaboration, moody management, base salary without commission is okay for a single person"
8533,"Corrupt , fraudulent and political middle management specially crm infra. Highly selfish ,incompetent and greedy. Work for their convenience. Good engineers suffer for the sake of management. Dumbs grow for the sake of management."
8544,"1) No transparency in performance management and probation confirmation 2) Manager behaves like fief and can do whatever he wants so you are screwed if you don't get a new manager 3) Most employees are hired from Oracle and are creating same toxic environment that exits there filled with insecurities, jealousy and mismanagement 4) HR is a handicapped mute spectator and works for the sake of keeping their jobs 5) Shifts hardship allowances were recently restructured to cut cost"
8548,"They promote equality but the reality is the environment is toxic. Filled with 'preference' and bias, if your boss like you then you can get the good set of accounts to work on, otherwise sorry you are on your own. To protect their image of best place to work, they 'create' lame reasons to make you leave on your own or terminate you, instead of being seen as firing / layoff people. Lots of politicking between management, the Ohana is a marketing gimmick, the reality is the management are mostly ex-oracle bringing along their old habits and culture and practicing them in here. Most of the great talent had left the company and the original good culture is dying. This will be the last place I recommend anyone to join."
8575,"JP office is extremely domestic, and does not have the drive, momentum or speed which other international tech firms or a typical foreign sub company has as a working culture. Since the majority of the people in the back office has been working here for a very long time (which is a good thing in one way), many of them are not use to changes - rather prefer to stick to the norm. Ohana is one of the key culture (which is a great conceptually) in Salesforce. But in JP back office, this is recognized in a different/miss leading manner. More specifically, it's been recognized as ""protection"", rather than supporting and challenging each other for growth. This shows up as lack of ownership, professionalism and extremely conservative working style/attitude. If you try to challenge someone, you're taken in a different way. Since there's really no culture of challenging each other, it's taken very offensively --- that's still fine but the most shocking part is, senior management doesn't notice or understand anymore of the benefits of growth via challenges and constructive communication. This is one of the most disappointing aspects of this office where it doesn't show to the outer world --- I have seen another review saying ""a master of disguise"" and completely understand what it means. When joining, do not expect a high paced, competitive working style lead by professionals with strong ownership --- but rather expect a conservative environment, hence for those who are looking for growth via challenges, constructive communication and data driven decision makings, this may not be the best place for you. Money is good, but growth wise, not able to recommend."

8618,"Inconsistent application of values, some poor management in specific roles"
8634,"All about the numbers without little looking at the causes. If you're unfortunate enough to have a bad territory that year, good luck trying to get out of it. Everyone knows it's about timing and territory but management will never admit that and will blame you for your lack of sales"
8635,"Problematic management, technically the work is not interesting"
8704,"This was once a company I genuinely felt pride in working for. Now the narrative has slipped into a sense of window dressing for the media and the market which shines through in several ways: Time tracking and process adherence seems to have taken over every corner of the company. A few years ago you felt that you were encourage to be innovative and to spend time on deep level analysis. Now you have to justify every hour of your day and not necessarily to to the benefit of the customer. Turning more Oracle than Google. Work load pressure is immense and there is an increasing number of people on long term sick leave due to stress. Managers are very often in a different location to you and there is very little awareness of the difficulty this can pose around communication, a sense of overwhelm and time available. HR does not have a presence in the smaller countries. This affects the health of both staff and relations as employees do not know who to turn to for a ‘sanity check’ conversation if a situations arise. HR processes are clearly there to support management and protect the company. There is a lot of talk about the feedback culture but the reality is that constructive criticism only works with few of the managers. Overall the sense is that the many hires from Microsoft, Oracle and similar has begun to take over the company mindset. It is much more ‘Me First’ than what is to the benefit of us all - and the customers."
8705,"Support teams are tiny in comparison to the sales team size, absolutely mad. If you’re new you’re 90% certain to get a terrible patch. Middle management is weak - usually people that have survived long enough. Senior management is a revolving door like football managers. Quality of SE varies wildly. Sales training is poor to non existent. Go there with a well developed sales tool kit from a BMC style company. Salesforce employees can be cultish, and it’s infuriating. Have increasingly lowered the barriers for hiring."

8747,"I had a wonderful experience working with Salesforce for the first 3 years of my employment there. However, for the 18 months that followed, my life was made hell. I am so disappointed to say that this was a result of constant bullying from female employees. I had been cursed at and shouted at by a senior female leader repeatedly and in front of other employees, and when reported this to my director was told that there was nothing he could do as she was a VP. This went on for a year. There was extreme and constant bullying, negativity and back-stabbing from females in the US Marketing department, so much so that when a colleague went to interview for that department, the Head of Marketing told her they were having lots of problems on the team with bullying and back-stabbing etc, and was it something she would be able to deal with (the answer to which was obviously no). This type of bullying just became the norm, and was totally accepted. My own first line manager, who was also female, was incapable of giving any type of constructive or positive feedback, particularly to female members of the team, would openly speak negatively about senior leaders in a team meeting setting and was regularly described as being extremely de-motivating by all team members. Again when reported to more senior leadership nothing at all was done about this. I would regularly end my day in tears, spending more time trying to ward off this bullying than being able to focus on my actual work. All of this was documented to my director, and to Employee Services however nothing was done about it. My director would speak with me maybe once every 3-4 months, so I was subjected to bullying by my manager and made to cope with this by myself. My mental health, sleep, appetite and general well-being suffered dramatically and when I mentioned this to my director he told me that I should just go to Employee Services, he also asked if maybe I was having personal issues. Again, my first few years with Salesforce were great, I had amazing team members, male and (amazing) female leaders in Ireland and Canada. However working with management and marketing dept in the US was an entirely different experience and in the end proved to be unbearable. I was stuck in a horrible situation for far too long, with no support or outlet, totally isolated and unable to seek guidance from management. I do hope something is done about the widespread and consistent bullying that is carried out by female employees in the US offices, particularly with regard to the infamously volatile and toxic Marketing Department."
8764,Make sure your direct management is consistent with corporate leadership
8780,"-The Salesforce recipe is to grow and split territories and squeeze every rep as much as they can. This is how they report double-digit growth every year to their investors. -You are compensated the same irrespective of the products you sell, however, management only cares about the core products you sell (Sales/Service Cloud). To the outside world this may not make sense, however, you are looked down upon and will get performance managed if you are not selling enough of these core products. I'm not a lawyer but this doesn't sound legal under Canadian labour law. -“Teacher’s Pet” Culture - Majority of reps (80%) don’t hit their quota but you can still get promoted and have your career accelerated if you play the “game” and suck up to management. -Colleagues who have been here for a while say it used to be an exciting, fun company and now it’s far more corporate and there are a lot of unhappy people in the office."
8795,"They promote equality but the reality is the environment is toxic. Filled with 'preference' and bias, if your boss like you then you can get the good set of accounts to work on, otherwise sorry you are on your own. To protect their image of best place to work, they 'create' lame reasons to make you leave on your own or terminate you, instead of being seen as firing / layoff people. Lots of politicking between management, the Ohana is a marketing gimmick, the reality is the management are mostly ex-oracle bringing along their old habits and culture and practicing them in here. Most of the great talent had left the company and the original good culture is dying. This will be the last place I recommend anyone to join."

8812,"I was debating whether to post this because I know it won't make a difference. But in the end, I decide to post this because I feel the need to share what we went through. Last month, Salesforce laid off a good number of customer success group members, including myself. I don't know the exact % or number, but it is not a small percentage. People will likely think I am negative toward the company because I got layoff. And you are right, who wouldn't be. Over the years, I truly believe in Salesforce and put lots of heart and soul into the company. This sudden layout is not fun and now gave me lots of uncertainty about my career and how do I support my family going forward. Salesforce talked a lot about Trust and Ohana, but this move killed both ideas for me. Where is the Trust when Salesforce let us go when the company is doing well and continue to hire many other roles. Where is the Ohana when Salesforce management cares purely about the books than the well being of the employee. Salesforce will say they are assisting those of us impacted to find another role internally. But the reality is there is little help, we are on our own to find a new position. There are some great people internally trying to help, but they are doing it on their own and not because Salesforce management asked them to. Many other hiring managers wouldn't even give us the chance or response to us. I do not blame other Salesforce Ohana not sensitive to what happened to us, it didn't happen to them, so they do not feel our pain. The bottom line is Salesforce put the books over employees which is the opposite of everything Salesforce stand for and claim to be.."
8818,"- A lot of micromanagement from Indian Managers. - I believe Ohana Culture is a beautiful thing, but certain Indian Managers using it wrongly to force their management believes on the employ. - Lately Hiring substandard folks from MRC's have lead to toxicity in culture in terms of politics."
8825,"- Mid-Management have prominently been promoted through the business from the Dublin SMB hub, and therefore lack basic management skills, and typically are more concerned about managing up and their careers over yours. - Very little internal personal or professional development. - Each Sales team does their own things (Forecasts/meetings, etc), with very little synergy or combined learning. Which has fostered a very ugly competitive and back-handed culture - with lack of trust a core problem throughout the UK, especially when dealing with US colleagues. - Lots of very talented people, from all aspects, Marketing, Product, and Sales have left the business, with their replacements (typically Graduates) lacking the basic skills."
8840,"-You basically can’t trust people in your own team cause they will find the way to steal your accounts and opportunities. -People are selfish and self-focused, they won’t help you unless they will get something in return. -If you are an Account Executive and you want to spend time with an SDR, you will be judged cause they hate each other (worse than a kindergarten). -No balance at all between work life and private life: you are asked to work at weekends, work at night after entire days in the office, work during bank holidays (well, bank holidays are not allowed). Allowed to take days off only in August and February. In some teams like mine you can’t even work from home. -You have to travel abroad 3/4 times per month and they want you to take flights at dawn or at night cause “you can’t lose working hours”. -One of the best values is volunteering - guess what? Underestimated and not taken for real in my team. -Managers only care about numbers, you are not a person at all. -People underestimate people working in other companies cause they feel they are the best but they are so poor and sad inside. -If people leave cause they feel bad, the other “teammates” and managers will make fun of them. -Micromanagement: your manager will expect to be cc’d in every single email you send to your customers."
8858,"Micromanagement: We have WEEKLY targets which fist of all requires Sales reps to justify themselves every week and exerts unnecessary pressure to close deals to unrealistic timelines which is damaging the client relationship. This also leads to non-stop pressure on a weekly basis which leaves no time to regenerate after a stressful month-end. While we are free to structure our days as we wish there are countless data points collected in the CRM which is used as a tool by management to exert additional pressure. Management style: We are not treated like professionals but more like interns who are here to learn and need to proof we are worthy of doing the job we are hired for. There is nothing more important than closing as many deals as possible as quickly as possible. Based on this all decisions are made disregarding the client relationship, the professional opinion of the sales rep or the health and the wellbeing of the rep. Unrealistic goals: Quotas are set unrealistically and only a handful of people are going to make their targets this year. On a bad month you go home with 2000 Euro which does not leave you much to live with an average room rent of 1200 Euro. Two of the teammates even live in camper vans."
8908,Complex sales process that requires many levels of management involvement
8935,"Revenue first company. More and more management talk a great game but their actions clearly show that people are a very distant second. Bias towards ""kingdom building"" in certain aspects of the business. Poor opportunities to progress."
8939,- micromanagement - big company
8957,Much more conservative in business decision making internally than you would think. Middle management is of patchy quality due to lack of structured career paths and leadership development Think.
8973,"micromanagement, lot of pressure, no leadership"
8984,"There is no culture at all. Ohana, VTO, Customer Success... They are just words. In my team, we were obliged to work on bank holidays and not allowed to take the day back off when it was BH in the country we covered. There is no flexibility in WFH. But what's really the worst is the management. In Salesforce there are no leaders, just poor managers. It all works around internal politics and friendships with people crossing borders continuously. Also, those ""managers"" text you after working hours and have no respect of your personal life. There is no interest in who you are as a person or your background, just how much you're closing. It's the least human company in tech I have ever witnessed and keeps losing talent year over year. I had a burnout and had my manager talk poorly and joking about me with team members and peers. Just one last thing, AEs are pushed to always complain about business partners (Solution Engineers, Sales Dev and Customer Success) when they really are the only ones to make the job qualitative and worth it."
8989,- Lack of transparency at times - Lack of management trust
9023,Micromanagement. Recent leadership doesn't go to bat for their team. A lot less autonomy than there use to be.
9048,No yearly performance reviews. No yearly salary increase. Change management every year. Toxic environment. Self-centred people. Back-stabbing culture. People higher up take credit for work others have done. Everyone is there for the money and pretend to make the world a better place. If management doesn't like you they'll make sure you won't progress in your career.
9057,"- Work-life balance is missing, especially now during covid, you will work long days and sometimes also in weekends. Work never ends. - Very performance driven, always high pressure to sell more, a lot of forecasting and at times micro-management. - Management is lacking coaching/people/leadership skills, you are heavily managed on opportunities and numbers, but very little on personal improvement. - Politics are present, as well as ego-centrism within sales & mngmnt. - Achieving your target depends on the distribution of accounts and opportunities, which changes every year. - Very complex internal organisation that can come across as impersonal at times. eg no HR and if you have questions you can only log tickets."
9130,"List is pretty huge but will try to be as precise as possible. Management need leadership skills. Had multiple discussion with HR on differences with management with no proper response from HR either. To my surprise I was asked to voluntarily resign and leave the organization without prior notice for raising challenges with Management and HR. After all these year when I try to reapply for a similar profile that showed up, I get a response stating my application is not a match which is not true coz I did same stuff earlier in Salesforce. It is okay to reject my profile but to my surprise someone in Salesforce system has changed my Country to Netherlands in Salesforce Database which will cause rejection of all my future applications for opportunities . Company which boasts of Ohana culture, transparency needs to take another look at themselves."
9193,"Direct management would determine whether you'll be staying in Salesforce for long or short-term.. Unfortunately thats the case for us, current leader is not someone most people would look up and respect due to his communication style and mindset - this has really discouraged the direct and extended team."
9204,"I don't think this review will change anything inside the company, but I hope it will enable people considering to join take a more informed decision. 1] Consider this: They fired several people on the back of the strongest quarter in company's history, that too in the middle of pandemic! Mark promised no layoffs for 3 months, and looked like he was waiting for 3 months to be over. LOL. 2] Unhealthy competition between global teams. US teams typically are more prone to hiding information from other teams across the globe. If you don't know the requirement, you can't build the system, and if you can't build the system, you are labelled as incompetent. (Sr.) Directors/ (Sr.) Managers will NEVER take accountability to gather the necessary information, and delegate all work to ICs (even freshers in some case). Since ICs are ill-equipped to make senior managers or directors in the US to divulge information, they practically get blocked, which results in underperformance discussions for ICs. This brings me to the next important claim by Salesforce - ""Embrace Feedback and Promote Transparency""! 3] I personally know people who would speak up to management (""see something, say something""). Somehow, those were the people who typically got impacted by ""restructuring"". Secondly, all this talk about transparency, and they won't divulge your performance ratings to you. This is the only place this happens. So my question is, if the employee doesn't know how the manager sees their performance, how would they take an informed decision on what next to expect or even challenge that assessment. The performance conversations are always positive from managers, so managers don't need to worry about the internal survey ratings from their team! OH MY, WHAT A MESS. Who's to stop managers from saying you performed awesome, but put a rating of 2 in the backend system? There are more, but I think you would have got an idea by now that the work environment is, at best, extremely toxic inside the sugar coated candy that gets presented to the outside world."
9207,- you live and die by your territory and AE’s - management does not take this into consideration
9228,- Lack of management - Lack of leadership - Poor onboarding process - Success only measured and valued by money
9236,"Pay below comparable jobs at other companies High school football captain culture Lack of talent at higher management level (great politicians, often not competent) Work life balance CEO personality cult"
9238,"In short: - Total compensation package less attractive than @ first sight - Sales Territory subject to change any time, any way. - Heavily Political - Poor Management - Little diversity (in terms of skills, background and genre) Management is surprisingly immature for a 10.000 people company, nobody really cares about you, numbers is all that matters. As such the aim of management is only hitting the number, no matter what. Meaning: no resource development, little training, harsh treatment when something goes wrong, no coaching, no understanding whatsoever. Numbers arrive, you're a star. They don't, you're an a***ole. The internal mantra is SFDC wants to innovate, unlike Oracle these days. Yet 50% of the people come from Oracle and they keep coming. Be very careful about what you are told at the interview. The territory assigned wil almost surely change after a few months, for the good (unlikely) or the bad (very much likely). Base pay is high (variable is becoming more and more difficult to hit and beat) but benefits are quite limited with respect to other IT companies. If evaluated in overall package the comparison is less favourable than originally thought bringing it to on par with other major IT employer. Also, the environment is pretty political: hiring is based on who you know, internally and externally, not on what you do and what you can achieve and not always the two aspects lead to the same point. As such relations are valued more than skills. Kind of : so is life but if you expect something different...."
9247,"Micro management, bloated and beaurocratic. Going from smaller startup to SFDC added a sea of new managers to navigate. Emphasis on hitting numbers rather than what's best for the customer."

To top it ,they hired goons, fearing a retaliation from the employees , which never happened . Some of these 40 ppl felt cheated as they were super performers and were bringing in business for the company , month on month . Worst ever severance I have heard in the industry 2months"

It's hard to keep up with all the changes and management doesn't do a great time of giving you time to be trained when changes arise Has lost the startup vibe- which means the employees suffer. SFDC is now more concerned with making money than protecting their employees"
9429,Lack of communication from top management . Sometimes even acquisitions are not communicated in the right way . Not many options for career advancement .
9434,"Unbelievably intense politics. Senior management gets their information from their inner circle, yet the inner circle is completely out of touch with what's really going on in the field and with employees. They make a great show of asking for input (such as Idea exchange and employee surveys) and then don't act on it. Very difficult interview process and then no support once you get in the door."

9440,"management has been with the company for more than 5 years, limiting growth and new ideas. can be cliquish"
9489,"- Compensation is low relative to peer companies - Days can be long (11-12 hrs minimum) and, after ~1 year, provide diminishing marginal return from the same role (result of 11-12+ hours of the same thing every day) - Team is hierarchical, having lost any ""startup"" feel it had as a result of significant growth. Result is a more political environments - Career trajectory within company is undefined and getting narrower as team's growth slows and more management levels are introduced. Promotion periods have also been extended, with fewer opportunities for ""moving up"" as a result - Rapidly diminishing exposure to senior management - more of a ""performance reporting and presentation creation"" role for the managers on the team"
9507,"Infrastructure engineering is very top heavy. It's become an org of overpriced ex Microsoft executives that have not delivered anything of value to the company and the group. There is complete lack of innovation in management style or technology. They have brought with them the management style of the 90's, which didn't really work to well for MSFT. The feeling in the group is contempt for Salesforce and the people committed to Salesforce. People work in fear, which is not the culture it was before they joined. It's sad to see the disregard that they have towards building an org on the values of Salesforce. Bad behavior and horrible treatment of individuals has been overlooked time and time again by HR and management."
9546,- Mixed messages from the sales management team when it comes to focusing on customer's success and prioritizing aggressive growth creates a pressure-sale environment which can/does damage our relationship and credibility
9580,"IT Management has devolved into a completely political organization. Success is defined by who you know, not by the work you do or your results. Promotion to management is unplanned and turnover is high."
9585,Great company but becoming too big for it's own good. Some of middle management is not very well qualified but are there by chance - timing. Can have a very Bro culture.

Pacing yourself is very important. -Upper management (VP and above) mean well but manages to make the team nervous and work off of fear of being made to look bad in front of the entire department. -Recruiters often have a tough time working with our support (Keeping in mind that sourcing support is something a lot of recruiters don't have experience with before coming to Salesforce)"
9636,People high UP misuse the company provisions travelling in first class to other office locations either to fulfill their pleasure trip (or) to meet their dates (or) to accomplish their private tasks.... Nobody scruitinizes their trip and expenses. HR as usual sucks up to higher management Women employees are discouraged from promotions No proper procedure on how people are promoted A single person can get 3 promotions in 3 consecutive years. Whereas a person working for 10 years may not get even a single promotion in the name of being incompetent . They can cook up any name for it. Often female employees are targeted.
9640,"Strong emphasis on management training, poor execution. HR Issues go un-answered"
9645,"Staying informed among the management chain changes. Lots of movement - all good things but definitely not doing a great job communicating those changes to employees first. I'm fortunate because I work in a department privy to that info, but to speak on behalf of other departments not close to HR, I know they feel lost and surprised too often. Many times creating unnecessary scares causing folks to prematurely jump ship - most boomerang back but k feel if we could get in front of this, we could reduce the boomerang rate. Additionally, RSU and overall stock grants to a limited number of employees. At my former employer, I was given RSUs off the bat but not here at SFDC and I've been here almost 5 years and in a fairly senior role. Not sure why that's the case. Colleagues feel the same and those good friends of mine who got stock are shocked I have none. Seems like a basic perk but it's not given to everyone :("
9661,Management very rigid not willing to allow employees to shape their own careers. Upper level management often fails to understand the work that is being done because they are too far removed.

9681,"Clear disorganization in middle management, lack of clear strategic direction for field organizations, lack of respect for employee work/life balance and lack of strong leadership at the mid-level"
9683,It is not a startup anymore. Too much top down management
9717,"Senior management could have been more judicious about some decisions. Also, a lot of politics behind the scenes."
9737,"The leadership here needs to provide management training to VPs. While the training AE's get is 2nd to none, the direct management and coaching falls extremely short. For example, 6 months in, I have yet to have any kind of a review or coaching. There's also a common thread of jaded sales reps here. For example, ""I took x account almost to the finish line, the fiscal year ended, and someone else got credit for the deal."" This is a systemic problem because I have noticed those reps no longer enter information into Salesforce..what's the point if you'll lose the client next year. Team building - really another surprising gap here. I'm sure San Francisco HQ doesn't have this problem. Too new to be offended but the above is real. We get the ""best company to work for"" but really its the ""best product to sell."" Which isn't bad but not great."

9838,"Slow promotional path, AEs rely a ton on solutions engineer. Difficult time management"
9856,Pay is low relative to other SaaS companies and creating even territories is a challenge for management - some people thrive and others starve and it is typically not due to differences in skill set.
