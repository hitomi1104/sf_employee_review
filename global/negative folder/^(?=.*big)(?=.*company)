124,"It's such a big company, it's tough to feel like any particular area moves the needle."
162,Really big company and things are always changing.
210,"Can feel ""cultish"" at times. SE pay varies based on Geography which can mean a paycut/non-competitive pay depending on where you live and where you were working before. SE's are not paid commission for the quarter if they leave during the quarter. No pro-rated pay. Nothing. You just lose it. Only place I've worked where you give two weeks notice, they agree you can leave after a week because there is not reason to keep you aboard for the full two weeks, and they don't pay you the full two weeks. While employed, the culture felt caring and inclusive, and not like a big company . When you're ready to leave, you get treated like it's a big company where you are just a number."
214,A lot of big-company process.
218,"big company, tough to navigate, not the best pay"
247,"The location is awful, it is depressing to work not in the city center - yes they’re moving to the docks but it’s still pretty far from downtown and won’t happen before 2021 No food - just some snacks, and pretty bad/unhealthy ones. These 2 points might seem trivial, but you will spend quite a lot of money on Luas and food, trust me, not to mention the time lost when commuting Career progression is there BUT it is extremely slow, which means it also takes a lot of years to move out of Dublin if you want to stay with the same company (4/5 years) It takes a lot of networking to move between functions (BDR to SE or CS) Harsh split of fixed and variable salary in AE roles (50-50) Level of stress always depends on the manager you get There’s not much of a fun element at work, besides the people, who are for the most part lovely and motivated. But no fun company kick off abroad, no cool off sites abroad, no happy hours, no end of quarter drinks... just compare it to other big tech company like Linkedin and Google - it’s much more boring The WFH policy for sales dev is non existent (1 day/month). Pretty ridiculous when this is an EMEA HQ and people are coming from all over. Allow people to go home and work from there to see their families, without having to take PTO all the time. Politics - it is a corporation, so it is political. It’s very clear that sometimes people get a role over others just because they are better liked, not because of their skills. Always need to show your best face which can be exhausting"
397,"- Poor work-life balance, it’s all about work. Late night messages and sometimes those bringing call for action for next morning.. And this is getting worse as all management layers feel the need to “contribute”.. - Customer success has changed to customer second; this is confirmed as common view in recent employee survey. It’s all about running the revenue up, on cost of some customers being outright screwed over under time pressure from us. It’s terrible to see this change, having been following this great company for many years. - You get promoted by making your numbers. You can be as disrespectful to Salesforce values as you wish to be, as far as the numbers are on the board. This is not a nice environment to work in. This is a shark tank.. - We are taught to be hustlers. We make stories of how great the prices are in certain month and how my manager has a budget for the extra discounts He would like to spend with you as a special customer. Big news: the discounts are always available for those willing to actually buy and there are no budgets for “special discounts”.. The only big diversion from this is January, when it truly is a buyers market. - It is high pressure, always. - Office is too full, and no home office allowed. - Ohana, trust, customer success - these are just words in Sales slides."
406,"Company has grown so much it feels it has trouble keeping up with itself. Company utilizes Google GSuite which doesn't work too smoothly with Apple or Microsoft products and hardware. You can get your work done, but if you are used to select your own tools or if you come from a Microsoft dominated environment you better be prepared for this as the impact to your productivity may be big in the beginning. The biggest problem to me has been that the Senior Management is not always on a level that I would expect them to be. There is a lot of variance in how they set the expectations, support their subordinates and especially how they present themselves as leaders. Maybe it is bad luck or maybe I'm not the right fit for the company, but this has also made me consider my options with other employers."
415,"Sales get smaller territories, lower commissions and higher targets each year. Becoming like one of the other big players with a red and white logo. Not surprising as 20% at least comes from that company."
456,It's a very big company and its quite difficult to get to know everyone. There's a surge of information coming from all over the place so its important to time manage
496,"Being such a big company you typically only work on small portion of the bigger picture at a time, but this isn't necessarily a con. It's just the nature of being a large company."
506,It is a big company with many people. Sometimes hard to find your way through massive amount of information and people around you.
512,"Unfortunately for a company claiming to have an keen eye on equality and trust, it lets a few things slip through the net: I was called aside following an evening out with colleagues whilst off campus. A department head had reported me after being open about my sexuality in a private conversation. I’m not sure why they felt that was necessary; I wasn’t given any specifics, only that it made them uncomfortable although they didn’t mention this during the conversation! Anyway a few days later I was summoned to HR and I was handed my notice. No warning. No chance to defend myself. It’s a pity because the pay was really good. The internal recruiter who hired me was lovely. The work didn’t seem challenging enough yet however and there was too much process and planning in my opinion. I guess you just have to be careful whom you confide in when you work at a big co. At least my new job allows me to bring my dog to work."
519,"Some disadvantages are coming from the advantages indeed: - It’s really difficult to make good money. Target are increasing and OTE are reflected based on global plans , so it depends a lot on how lucky you are you will be able to reach your targets. - You will have to manage the relationship not just with your direct reporting, but wih different stakeholders who will have different interests. As an example, different AEs from different vertical products interested in selling into the same account, different RVPs to manage with. Alignment is one of the most important words in the company. Some days you will finalise your day thinking about how 90% of your calls were to manage talks with colleagues and not customers/ partners. - Depending on the area you are focus in, territory can be really big or small. This comes with the maturity of the product in the market. Per example , Core products AEs are really focus in small territories, however new products in the Org (Mulesoft, Commerce ,...) counts with small teams yet. These AEs are focus in strategic deals and normally cannot support all the opportunities properly. At the end, quotas are increasing because of new products in the portfolio , but you cannot have the same level of support like in mature ones. So I would say it depends how lucky you are with an specific account your co prime could make a big piece of the quota. - I don’t personally believe you have to be the best sales person in the world to sell in Salesforce. Marketing investment and resources are super huge, some customers buy the vision and what they see in events many times , plus there is plenty of really experienced partners in the region. I would say your results at the end of the year will depend 30% of your work and 70% how lucky you are with your territory , maturity of your account and the work of your co-primes - If you like the start uptype of experience , this is not a place where you will be comfortable for a long time (I must confess smaller regions like Iberia are closer to a start up type of company thought ) However, sometimes you will have the feeling you will spend more time reporting, reading Quips, covering different events, than thinking strategically how to gain relationships, trust and projects. - This company can help you win good money, but reducing your health due to stress and long time at work. Work life balance is challenging. There is not an ending point , you will have to be really good Managing this point to have everyone happy : you (and your health , your closer family (that will have to be open on you travelling and spending long hours at work, and the company) This point is being really important. Some people are leaving , or thinking about doing it, because of this last reason. Retaining employees is key for the company. Many important people use to leave (mostly coming from the acquisitions) because they don’t get use to the way the company operates. A lot of people are ex oracles, this can creates a local culture where not anyone might be confortable with."
575,"In such a big company getting yourself noticed can be difficult. Also, there is a lot of ""process"" to follow for little reward apart from what management sees."
639,- Little opportunities to grow your career quickly even if overachieving your targets - Becoming a big enterprise software company and losing the small size company spirit

674,"Being such a big company you typically only work on small portion of the bigger picture at a time, but this isn't necessarily a con. It's just the nature of being a large company."
745,"If you are looking to coast this is not the place. They demand passion, energy, and helping all colleagues to achieve a customer focused company. If you the type of person who has said ""that is not my job"" then you will not fit the culture. Everyone at Salesforce is like a big family and you must contribute."
823,- big company can be frustrating
833,typical....really cool company gets really big and loses a little bit of its edge.
837,"As company scales, challenge to maintain talent level across bigger workforce"
840,"Why is drinking such a big part of the company culture? It saddens me that even a below-21 intern feels he/she can't participate fully in the ""culture"" because drinking is such a ""big part"" of it, as seen in a recent Glassdoor review. I don't drink for health reasons, and I often feel like work events (holiday parties, team celebrations, Dreamforce) are less rewarding for me because the non-alcoholic choices are an afterthought. Can I have a $20 gift card instead?! I've seen a lot of employees misbehaving and embarrass themselves through alcohol. Time to cut back. Alcohol is not the same thing as a company culture. Second, I have no illusions that working remotely is a perfect situation. I know I miss out on a lot in the office and I am ok with it. That said, I think the company could do more to make Salesforce better for non-SF members of the Ohana. I also think there should be better career paths for those who are not managers. Because I'm remote, I have been told I don't have much room to move up since I can't manage remotely (even though my manager manages me remotely... and that seems to work fine). The company expects so much of us during Dreamforce (12+ hour days for a week), but we never see any time off as a result of that."
860,"Like at any enterprise tech company, the work is big and complex. With responsibility over projects that affect hundreds to thousands of people, balancing work priorities and personal life can feel a bit rocky at times. Fortunately, there is always a bright mind to turn to for help and no shortage of motivated, hard-working people around you to get the job done and have a little fun while doing it."
873,The company's big and it's hard to know everything that's happening.
886,It's gotten way too big and Salesforce puffs out it's big chest and considers it a privilege if companies become clients. Way too much boasting You're a cog in a wheel and will report to several different people there. New territories are given out without any input from AEs. You're successful if you have a good territory and it depends if Salesforce has pissed off that company in the past. If so - good luck!
906,"The people think they are amazing, they are average. Its got the normal big company politics, and is more of a marketing machine than owners of any revolutionary tech. Externally thought of as leaders in tech, but really internally very behind the times on cloud based computing. Quite a large monolithic stack, that has not evolved in a long time. Any innovation here is bought in acquisitions, which are very poorly integrated into the whole."
936,"As a big company, it can be hard to get visibility cross-functionally. This is the first ""big-ish"" company that I have worked for and it is interesting to see how compartmentalized we can get. I don't frequently know or understand what is happening in other departments, and I don't get as much insight into that as I'd like to."
948,"-Terrible customer service-- Unless client pays for premium customer service, we can't help them (and even then we have to pass them onto a rep in another country); -Huge company with an even bigger ego. If you worked anywhere else, it's nothing compared to SF. You're lucky to work there and they don't value any of the reps opinions. If you were a senior level salesperson elsewhere, prepare to take at least two steps back. -Quota is unrealistic and management knows it. The best reps hit quota once a quarter typically. -Overworked: scolded if you don't answer calls and emails on weekends. -Benefits aren't always what they seem. Try to take full amount of paternity leave and you'll be told by management that, ""No one really takes that long for paternity leave. You can come back in a few days or else your job won't be here."" -Never able to take days off at end of months or the entire last month of a quarter."
1047,"Unfortunately, all of the above is not available across the board. My manager has, short of explicitly saying it, told us we can only volunteer 15 hours a year, to create only one career development goal, “he doesn’t care what it is”, rolls his eyes at the thought of us taking advantage of the company’s championed cause of meditation, told us we aren’t allowed to take ANY time off for a six month period every single year. And to top it off, he’s the biggest micromanager I have ever worked for in my career. You better be the first one there, and last to leave, finishing work at home doesn’t “count”. And not once, has he ever complimented or commended any of us. Doctor appointment? Have a family commitment during the week? Better not make a habit of it. God forbid you have something going on that requires frequent doctor visits. If we want to grow our skill sets via Trailhead, better do it after hours or on the weekend. Mind you, I talk to other people in the company and they are appalled that this is happening. My ratings are based on my specific experience, and do not represent the typical Salesforce experience. I thought it was just him, and some of it certainly is, but the whole department is toxic. There’s turnover left and right, every couple of weeks it seems another coworker chooses to leave the company. And if the VP cared, they would do something. It’s blatant. I have thought of raising the issue to HR but it’s obvious these people have been here a long time, and make someone above them happy, so it’s pointless."

1490,Very big company - maybe not as much impact as you'd like to have..
1520,Can be bureaucratic at times but that's with any big company
1592,big company and sometimes dev process involve to many unnecessary people
1642,"If you agree to special projects your career may stagnate rather than grow. The newish job definitions created transparency, but don't always benefit the employee or the company when something outside of the box is needed. A PM working on a new product that will take a multi-year effort does not meet the requirements for their job or promotion because everything is based on an existing product and working with Scrum teams. Taking that big bet stretch assignment will bench you career-wise."

1750,"Being a big company, sometimes things get really bureaucratical"
1776,"Experience might differ between teams, depending on managers. As the company grows bigger, it's more difficult to maintain the same great culture among the people. Direction from HQ in the US is often irrelevant to the current situation in Asia"
1803,"It just took some time overall to get everything done, which is understandable because it is a big company."
1865,Typical big company with soiled organization.
1908,"As the company has gotten bigger, roles have become more narrow. I had looked to move into another role for a while, but, as a director level, there weren't a lot of opportunities - Salesforce is hiring more and more junior people to fill roles. My position was eliminated and replaced by an analyst level person straight out of college. Many other higher level ( read- older, long-term employees) folks were part of the same layoff in 2020. You will have many different managers while you are there - I had 13 in 8 1/2 years. So, if you have a bad one, wait - they will move into something else. The bad part of this is its hard to make a mark when you constantly have to re-prove yourself. The company used to give raises every year - even just a cost of living raise. This stopped around 2017 or so. So negotiate your upfront salary well."
1914,Self Service company makes it tough for some folks with big egos.
1920,big company and sometimes hard to navigate
2091,"Since it is a bigger company now, there aren't major ways to get equity exposure other than the ESPP (which is still a solid way)"
2104,-still a few rogue pms who don’t invest in design - big company and hard to work across cloud - lots of reactive shifts in priority & hard to execute against a moving target
2123,Do a quick search of Salesforce marketing spend compared to other big tech companies and you’ll see why working here is such highly touted. The company has shown its true colors during the covid pandemic. Impossible quotas as is with no quota relief during pandemic. BDRs are measured by how much Monopoly money they put into Salesforce and how buddy buddy they are with their AEs. The company says one thing to the press but treats its employees a completely different way. I have not felt any instance of “Ohana” since being here even though I was super excited to work for Salesforce. BDRs feel as if it’s them against the world at this company and have to deal with AE ego on a consistent basis.
2135,All the pains that come with being a big company. Not a lot of organic growth.
2167,contractors are given the responsibilities of full-time employees and sometimes stay in roles for YEARS but they are not given any of the benefits of full time employees. there is lots of redundancy in people's jobs - feels like i meet a new person every other day that has the same role as me yet we don't collaborate on projects. left arm doesn't know what the right arm is doing at times. teams and reporting relationships are illogical and disorganized because people get promoted without regard for how it disrupts the bigger picture. the pace of things is sometimes way too fast - it is helpful to stop and smell the roses and slow down a bit rather than plow full speed ahead just for the sake of innovation. and the company can be a little cult-like and self-important. lots of emphasis is focused on public speaking and flashy slide decks and celebrity. the beauty of a slide deck and a well-written speech is sometimes valued more than the quality of the work.
2169,"""Diversity"" - There's a good lip service but, the reality is that upper management is mostly white. Until there is massive change in how recruiting and cultivating talent happens in the tech industry white guys are going to begat more white guys. Chances are pretty good they don't have friends or connections who are POC. This also holds true from people who come from other tech companies. When rats jump the ship they tend to bring other rats with them. Not so subtle hints that you have to hold a ""right"" set of beliefs/values - you have to get onboard or made to feel like an outsider. If you question or don't hold a certain The idea that Salesforce can save the human race - Salesforce is an innovative tech company with products and services that help customers do business. Be that! While SF is the biggest and holds a huge marketshare, it has created this idea that it can somehow save the world. Surrounded by lots of people who don't actually work with you - there are some teams that have a larger representation in certain hubs but, if you have a team that is largely based in one hub it can get lonely being surrounded by people who are largely irrelevant to your daily work life. It can also infringe on W/L balance. Ohana seating - Gross. Everyone needs their own desk and space. ""Data Driven"" - Sometimes translates to manipulating for personal gain and benefit."
2186,just a super big company which always become bureaucratic.
2208,"There was no transparency in how promotions were decided and very little feedback to help get you to the next level. Employee Success is a joke at this company. It was total chaos trying to get anything done with way too many cooks in the kitchen. If you're an older employee, don't expect any of your previous work experience to mean anything. If it didn't happen at Salesforce, it didn't happen at all. Compensation is definitely lower than the other big tech firms in San Francisco. Stop using so Hawaiian jargon and ridiculous costume characters. It's a business, not a pre-school. No stock refresh for grade 7's in ES, even though we were eligible under the plan."
2234,Big company with big company values
2255,"Can feel ""cultish"" at times. SE pay varies based on Geography which can mean a paycut/non-competitive pay depending on where you live and where you were working before.

2391,just a big company to navigate
2410,"This is a big company that focuses mostly on B2B tech, so it can feel very corporate. Vibe depends on which division you're in."
2443,Sometimes when you work in a such a big company it's hard to get noticed for the value you provide and when it's as big as Salesforce it's hard to get assigned to work on truly strategic projects.
2559,Great company but becoming too big for it's own good. Some of middle management is not very well qualified but are there by chance - timing. Can have a very Bro culture.
2630,"As a big company, it was harder to get things done. Executives are not always in sync. It seems they prefer to hire from the outside rather than promote from within. Lots of changes going on these days."
2637,"Dysfunctional management, mixed messages, super political, many products don't connect w/each other....It's a marketing machine. The biggest slide ware company in SV. HR is all about protecting the VP's who are driving to get the #'s in."
2670,"It's a very big company. At times things are slow, bureaucratic, and inefficient, but that comes with the territory. Internal mobility is possible, but not as easy as it should."

2808,- Big company which means big changes - You have to know the right people
2874,"- The biggest shock to me: how bad lower-level management is. Idk where these people came from but they are micromanaging, unrealistic, unhelpful, insulting...like the list really goes on. Maybe my expectations were too high coming to this amazing company but there needs to be more training for leaders. - Promotion process is terrible, you're expected to ""network"" to find any answers to anything and it ends up being a huge waste of time more often than not. And don't even think about leaving the sales org. Managers don't help and People across the company look down on BDRs. Also, the pay compared to other places is not good at all. $50K base in seat and after you promote to the next step. OTE increases in next role but not base salary no matter what you promo into. - High metrics, low commission - Like any other sales role, you are made to feel as though you are only as good as your numbers - The metrics are INSANE. Everyone knows people are just BS'ing their way through bc the metrics are so unrealistic - Work-life balance is horrible if you're actually trying to do your job the legit way and its high stress all the time despite whatever is going on in the world - Snobby AEs that are selfish but no one cares if you're hitting your number"

Everything seems urgent and high priority to leaders.
3444,Very big company. So some decisions are made at the higher level with no input from time engineers or individual contributors
3447,"-The company is still stuck in a market based compensation model, but they're not even in line with their current markets. They have yet to adapt like other big tech firms. -There are people placed in high level(SVP & EVP) positions who have little, to no, experience in the organizations and the impact is present by the mass exodus of tenured individuals. -The politics are some of the worst I've ever experienced. If you know people who have, or currently do work here, ask around."
3532,It is a big company and sometimes there are so many moving parts and lots of people involved to do small task.
3554,"Salesforce is a big company that has been around for a while and with that comes less agility and more fixing tech debt, etc."
3651,Too big of a company. Lost it's core. Too many changes in structure... feels like IBM
3731,It's a big company with many levels of management
3756,"- The job itself is not ""easy."" Because the company is always innovating, always bringing new products and solutions to market, and always striving to stay at the forefront of the most pressing business challenges and trends facing our customers, there's constantly new information we need to learn in order to be trusted advisors to the clients we support. It's a lot to learn and stay enabled on; this is a company that thrives on fast-paced change. - Additionally, because our platform literally does everything, there are a variety of ""point solution"" competitors big and small that we have to constantly stay one step ahead of. Fortunately, Salesforce invests in product specialists, competitive intelligence teams, and other resources to support you. - You can definitely make a lot of money here if you are a top performer. That said, I get the sense that our base salaries are less competitive than comparable software sales roles at other high tech companies. That's a tradeoff to working at the best company though. Once you work here, you can get hired wherever. In fact, many people leave the company in order to get a MUCH more senior role somewhere else, and then leverage that to come back to Salesforce at much higher role and salary band. Staying at Salesforce might mean that your upward mobility is slower."
3818,"Work is super demanding, and bureaucracy started to building out as the company continued to get bigger. Decision making process can be very slow depending on certain department, which could lead to a lot of rework."
3882,BIG company and getting bigger every year!
3885,"Extreme title inflation compared to tech company peers Some big egos - you have to know how to market yourself and your accomplishments to be seen / advance (it is a sales & marketing company after all!). More than once I saw this happen even if actual underlying performance was mediocre or if the person was harsh towards junior team members or peers. Big budgets - teams spent $$ on things that really didn't need to be bought. Use it or lose it culture as it related to budget. Financial margins could be bigger if spend could be better controlled, but the spend culture created a challenge. If the company needed to control spend, hiring and/or T&E were the levers used creating sudden starts and stops in both these areas."

4098,It's a massive company so all the headaches with a big company
4168,"As a big company, you sometimes need to work with a longer timeframe in mind; you won't have the agility that you see in a start-up unless you're in a research group. Also, the path to promotion may be longer term than at a smaller company."

4355,"Not many to note. Depending on your team, you might feel some burnout but the company is big on work life balance. Also the promotion process sucks"
4388,"Big, big company now with lots of cha ge"
4425,"As someone whose been with the company many years, it has transitioned from a smaller, agile, product-focused company to a Marketing and Sales holding company that does little or no product development. Nearly every major product announcement over the last few years featured huge fanfare, but resulted in the product dying a quiet end within 2 years. Pretty much every major product announcement now is just a Marketing 're-alignment', rebranding existing products, not actually developing anything new. All innovation is bought, not developed internally, and there is little sign that the various acquisitions (Mule, Tableau, Slack) are actually creating a 2+2=5 effect. It really feels like a bunch of independent companies that are owned by the same conglomerate. The focus on growth by acquisition also means very limited growth opportunities internally since the existing products aren't really growing or innovating significantly, it isn't creating new positions. A new, related phenomenon is that in order to retain talent, many low-to-middle managers are getting 'promotions in place', i.e. they are getting a bigger title and more money without additional responsibility because their orgs aren't growing. So you see lots of VPs with only two directs who are also VPs, creating lots of unnecessary layers of management who all feel they have to micromanage those below them in order to show they are 'adding value'. This lack of organic growth means a lot of people are attritting because they don't see any real career path. Career development isn't a focus beyond the first line of management. After that its all operations, process and programs. Manager success is evaluated on how many programs did you develop and market, not how many employees did you develop or how productive and happy is your team. Another issue is the split between the company image and Sales. While I do think a lot of product and engineering people do really believe in the company values, remember, this is a company founded by a Sales Guy. There is a very cutthroat sales mentality inherited from Oracle that often sees sales reps and leaders blatantly ignore values like trust, equality and customer success in order to hit their quarterly number. Sales is really the #1 value. The large and not rationalized product stack means that often sales reps are pitted against each other because they have overlapping products, and the result can be the customer gets the product of the better rep, not the product they need. Many products are 'zombie' products with no future product development and virtually no support staff, but because there are reps with quota on them, they are still being sold despite the fact that the customer will likely attrit in a couple of years once they realize they've been sold a lemon. Turnover in the Sales org also means a lot of inexperienced account execs who have zero understanding of the products or the company culture but are still being put on big accounts. Over and over you'll hear how solutions teams are the most vital part of the sales organization, but every award, spiff or shoutout goes to the sales rep. You'll hear about some amazing demo that sold the deal but the only names you will here are 5 different reps/AEs, like they did all the work themselves. They'll pat themselves on the back, go off to sales club and collect a massive commission and the SE will get back to work. Another thing most new employees won't notice at first because they just got their nice offer package, is that Salesforce hires at much higher dollar amount than it pays existing employees. Pretty much every new hire will make a LOT more than everyone else on a team. It's joked repeatedly that if you want a raise or promotion, your best option is to leave the company and get re-hired in a year. Stock is incredibly stingy. Unlike most tech companies that do yearly refreshes, you will be lucky to get new RSUs every 3-4 years, even for very top performers. Many relatively senior employees (15+ years overall experience, 4+ with company) have NO stock. A team of 10 might get 2-3 stock refreshes in a year. This is the #1 retention tool, and yet Salesforce consistently lags behind all competitors here. A lot of lip-service is given to the 'giving back' part of the company. When I joined this was for real. You got a week of VTO time, and if you used all that you'd get a sizeable grant to give to a charity of your choice. They removed the grants a few years ago without making any real announcement. The VTO time is still there but if you are above a certain level, you are on 'unlimited' PTO (which means you can take what you want, but only if your manager is cool AND you don't feel guilty about taking off during whatever crisis is currently happening). This makes the VTO time meaningless, since it just gets blurred in with PTO and sick leave."
4473,Sometimes it is difficult to grow as company is having big changes. Young people is having its difficulties.
4477,As every big company there are times that you can feel the stress
4562,"-(Paris office) very ""political"" environment -big company, you are just ""someone"", your manager changes every year -HR : does not really exist, you will never have a real discussion with an HR employee, strong weakness of Paris office (France)"
4631,"- Sometimes unrealistic sales / business management expectations from product resulting in oversells, it's a solid product but there's a lot of work needed to get to a setup that will do well on the enterprise scale. Smaller setups can work but if you are looking for the big benefits it requires time investment. - The 'family feel' push internally. This is really nice when you are newly immersed in it but you also need to be wary of assuming it's like a perfect family. Families have fights, internal squabbles and sometimes break apart so always look after your own future don't expect that completely from the company. - Steep learning curve if you've never worked on Salesforce product(s) before but there is lots of help there. Still a great place to work and earn professional experience or build your career. Genuinely love the company and everything they've done for me to date."
4664,"SFDC is struggling to figure out how to be a big company. Has hard-nosed, win at all costs Oracle-type culture. You need to decide if you're into that. Sales mgmt has no problem berating entire teams in conference calls. Mgmt within the Platform team is unfocused and not very seasoned. Company turns a blind eye to hyper aggressive field sales people who run over their fellow employees."
4675,It’s a big company.
4749,"I joined a smaller company Salesforce owned that was eventually swallowed whole by the larger Salesforce company, and we were fully integrated into one of the major clouds. Things were very pleasant and work was interesting before the roll over into Salesforce. However, once my team joined the larger company, is when things took a turn unfortunately. I believe things took a turn because Salesforce is built on top down management. The bigger the title the bigger the voice you’ll have. People use their title as weight when making decisions. The overall design culture is perceived as a second thought to a lot of teams. Due in part that your engineers can and will make decisions for you based on seniority. Not all, but most teams have a hard time getting their engineers to innovate and work with them. This behavior also comes from the previously mentioned work life balance. Anything that looks like it may take an extra hour, will fall off your design quickly. Be carful of Kool-aid drinking. They use the term “Ohana”, family in Hawaiian culture (which is also cultural appropriation) to describe their own internal company culture. The management team uses this type of thinking to determine if your a team player or not. The type of “family” culture they perpetuate creates a lot of passive aggressive behavior. Add the behavioral issues onto the top down management, and you have a recipe for ladder climbing, favoritism, yes men, and brown nosing. The executive running the design on my cloud showed incredible bias and fueled this behavior. As well as some very questionable hiring and promotional practices. I felt their behavior was highly unethical, and they felt no remorse for their actions. The product you build at Salesforce will only ship 3 times a year. That’s if it ships at all. The pace is incredibly slow moving. I can not stress that enough. Changing an icon can literally take 9 months. This can make it hard to retain the talent that comes from a start up environment. Which Salesforce is in desperate need of. The salary is adequate at best for most designers. I found out later that I actually made much more coming from a different company and rolling into Salesforce. RSU’s are some of the lowest you’ll be awarded in the tech industry for a company this size. Most director level people get any meaningful stock refresher. Like I mentioned, top down management. I negotiated cash over RSU’s (which made my offer compelling). While a lot of what I wrote can seems very negative, not everyone I had the chance to work with made me feel this way. I did have the opportunity to meet “some” talented designers and engineers. I had the opportunity to volunteer and help others. The work I was doing at the time had impact up to certain point and I did learn a thing or two while at Salesforce. TL;DR: Top down management creates passive aggressive behavior. Slow moving development time, Salesforce only ships 3 times a year. Design is a second thought for most teams (but not all). Base salary is average, not competitive. RSU’s for a company this size are some of the worst in the industry."
4865,"Lots of internal politics, no surprise at any big company this isn't Salesforce specific it happens everywhere. Promos are about timing mainly."
4903,"The following below is a reflection of the company: - Acquired a bunch of companies, especially during 2015 - 2016 which made career advancement tough. - Constant changes and initiatives being rolled out that makes it challenging to adjust quickly The following below is a reflection of the team: - Onboarding experience wasn't that great. I had to figure out how to maneuver around the system by myself often - There wasn't really a culture on the team. A lot of people kept to themselves which made it hard to build rapport. Integrating members from acquisitions also was a bit awkward as there wasn't any announcement / formal introductions. - Difficult to advance and grow within the organization as the company was growing so quickly. - The work you put in in terms of recruiting, events, VTO, etc.. can sometimes be overlooked since the org was so big. You may get lost in the shuffle - There were a lot of questions about leveling that the organization leaders were working on right before I left."
4923,"- big company so work feels specialized - so many interns spread throughout multiple buildings, made it harder to meet new people"
4924,"The only con is that if you are under 21 you cant drink, and drinking is a big part of their company culture."
4964,"Why is drinking such a big part of the company culture? It saddens me that even a below-21 intern feels he/she can't participate fully in the ""culture"" because drinking is such a ""big part"" of it, as seen in a recent Glassdoor review. I don't drink for health reasons, and I often feel like work events (holiday parties, team celebrations, Dreamforce) are less rewarding for me because the non-alcoholic choices are an afterthought. Can I have a $20 gift card instead?! I've seen a lot of employees misbehaving and embarrass themselves through alcohol. Time to cut back. Alcohol is not the same thing as a company culture. Second, I have no illusions that working remotely is a perfect situation. I know I miss out on a lot in the office and I am ok with it. That said, I think the company could do more to make Salesforce better for non-SF members of the Ohana. I also think there should be better career paths for those who are not managers. Because I'm remote, I have been told I don't have much room to move up since I can't manage remotely (even though my manager manages me remotely... and that seems to work fine). The company expects so much of us during Dreamforce (12+ hour days for a week), but we never see any time off as a result of that."
5007,"Broken promises: I was assured when I came on-board that the job was a contract-to-hire, but after the initial contract period was over, I was extended on the same contract and told that no full-time would be available. I was also told upon my initial visit to the office that I'd be visiting the office in-person several times a year, but after 7 months, there is no repeat visit on the horizon, so I feel very disconnected from the team. The only thing we actually do is build a web app that helps people send out marketing e-mails. I was excited about being part of something big that sets the industry standard, but I eventually figured out that couldn't care less for the company's product. My manager was changed halfway through my contract to a person who is a great coder but who has virtually no management experience, and she had two modes: ignore me completely and tell me everything is great, or micromanage my work with a critical eye and tell me I am going too slow and I don't deserve to bill for a full week. It didn't seem like she was capable of paying attention in a way that was really supportive. The last complaint I have is that priority decisions were made in a very top-down way without an intelligent eye on the effectiveness of work that's being done. Lots of automation coverage was built around medium to low priority test cases that were decided arbitrarily, while outstanding known defects and other important things were ignored."
5068,"As company scales, challenge to maintain talent level across bigger workforce"
5088,"A few months ago, there was a large surge of hiring. Most of the hires came from a third party vendor that was closing. Some of the new hires from this location were previously denied applicants. I discovered that these new employees were being hired in Senior positions over me, making more money than me, and were even given relocation bonuses that I was told I could not have when I relocated in the previous year to work for this company. When I was first hired, the interview process seemed incredibly difficult to get through. Once they had seats to fill, it became a mad dash to find anyone with any Salesforce experience to fill the seats, and they seemed to do anything to get those people here. I am now left feeling worthless and insignificant in my surroundings. My experience, hard work, and dedication to this company is now meshed into a field of call center employees dashing to meet metrics. On top of the new employees that were hired from this vendor, they also hired managers. I know that people take time to adjust, but these managers are killing our vibe. Salesforce prides itself on transparency. These managers keep secrets and treat employees like worker bees. We have had multiple interactions with upper management where they will talk about a big change, and act surprised when they find out that those of us at the bottom didn't know about the change. The new managers don't understand the need for work and life balance. We previously had options to work remotely when we were ill, or even having an off day. Where we were didn't matter as long as we were doing our jobs. Now, if you are sick and want to work from home, you are asked to take PTO (since you are not given Sick time, you need to use your vacation time)more often, which encourages sick people to come to work and spread their illness throughout the building. Talent seems to mean nothing here as well. It's all about how many years of service. I know of employees who don't put in the effort , who barely get their work done, and they are promoted because of how long they've been here, while I train other employees, mentor, and do still meet metrics, and I'm stuck at the same level. You report to a manager here, but good luck finding your manager if you need something. The Managers are presented as people managers, but when it really comes down to it, they are project managers. I end up doing many small tasks for my manager, that my manager doesn't have time to do, in order to keep my team running smoothly. By no means do I blame my manager for this, but they need to take some of this off their plates. They seem to work 24 hours a day. We recently had a huge push to get our case load down to a specific number. Our portion of the Organization spent 10 weeks squeezing every last drop out of every single one of us to close as many cases as possible. The communication that was sent out read as ""I know you are working hard and thank you for your efforts, but work harder"". After week 8, everyone around me was miserable. There were daily meltdowns from ""Analysts"" who were mad at customers for needing help, when the real problem was the amount of work they expected us to do, and the free time outside of work they expected us to sacrifice. Of course, management didn't see these meltdowns because they were off running Reports on metrics and trying to over analyze the reason behind xyz. When I first came here, I really thought that this was a career. It now feels now different than any call center or retail job I have worked in. This is the longest I've ever worked at a company without receiving a promotion."

5275,"New AE product enablement is embarrassingly bad. The first 12 months are sink or swim, and aside from self-enabling yourself, the territories are hit or miss. Sales reps that have crushed their quota at other companies often struggle due to poor territory carves and slow enablement ramp time. Furthermore, Marketing Cloud basically acts as its own company within Salesforce. Collaboration with the CRM business is weak at best, and Marketing Cloud's biggest competitor has been its own internal solution, Pardot. Last, sales managers here are mostly just that, managers. True leaders in management are few and far between. For example, struggling AEs are mostly on their own to figure it out, which is resulting in higher AE turnover."

5433,"- Anyone not in a direct quota carrying roles is treated as a second-class citizen, and the sales side of the business (e.g. account executives and sales leadership) is revered and constantly lauded on internal calls. - Obsessive fixation on hitting quotas and revenue targets, which drives a culture of upselling (even when the customer doesn't really need it—despite their ""Customer Success"" value). - It is difficult to relate the SE pay and bonus to company performance—despite ever-growing revenues and beating last year's results, this never really translates into a significant increase in pay/bonus. - Murky promotion and career progression process that gets called out every year in the employee survey, but nothing really gets done about it. Hiring budget seems to be spent on bringing in more AEs (the quality of which varies considerably). - The open, sharing culture has led to oversharing, and useful information and documents are scattered across a load of different sources (Google Drive, Quip, Slack, various Salesforce orgs)—with no single way of searching across all of these. - Lots of internal ""noise"", which can distract from the day job (webinars, endless all-hands calls, irritating Slack channels etc). - Internal culture can feel a bit cultish at times and there is a growing disconnect between the US and non-US workforce. You have to drink the Kool-Aid to get ahead. - The internal Salesforce org (Org62) is a mess making it very difficult to navigate, Lots of duplicate data (e.g. accounts and contacts) across the organisation, which leads to internal fighting over territories/customers. - The company swings between big corporate and scrappy startup: some internal processes are excessively bureaucratic and long-winded (e.g. requiring manager approval for a $5 software purchase), and elsewhere decisions are taken on a whim. - Some employees can feel ostracised if they don't submit to the (exceedingly) left-leaning, social justice obsessed political views of the organisation. - A globally distributed workforce means that emails and Slack messages come in at all hours of the day—depending on the team, internal meetings can start early or run late into the evening."

5578,"One of the most stressful, high strung and political modern corporate environments outside of wall street...and it all starts from the very top. The CEO suffers from a big blind spot when it comes to running the company: he rules by diktat, asks for zero feedback, micromanages ad nauseum, and is a firm believer in the Art of War as management philosophy: his directs compete aggressively for his attention and approval and never openly disagree with him. He still runs the shop as if the company was a start-up and he had the insight to make calls on day to day minutia. Salesforce is quickly becoming internally bureaucratic and clunky; innovation, creativity and risk taking are highly discouraged. Long hours, zero respect for family or personal time (emailing and working on weekends and late at night is a widely accepted practice)."

5865,The big company so getting anything was done that involves cross-team takes some time
5947,"Underneath the facade, Salesforce is focused on perception more than reality. VTO isn't volunteer time off at all. It's voluntold time on-top (of existing work load) for most of the company. We have targets for VTO set, but many business units aren't staffed appropriately to actually take the time off. Instead it's just adding work load on top of our existing work load. Also, the company really exemplifies the wealth gap, with those at the top heavily rewarded with expensive trips, awards (including cars, watches, etc.) while the majority of the company is paid somewhere around the 75th percentile of industry. We once had a travel freeze but the company still sent the top 100+ employees to a big shindig in Hawaii - and they broadcast it and insisted that everyone across the company ""tune in"" to it remotely. Wow."

5979,Salesforce has gotten so big that some processes are much slower due to the corporate nature of the company
5986,"Politics. If you have only worked at small companies, big companies are a different beast. Salesforce, like any big company, has an element of politicking to it. At any company playing ""the game"" is important, so expect that here. Large quotas, and small patches. Salesforce has fine tuned territory management, and some ae's have stronger patches than others. It is important to succeed early and often so that you have the credibility to be assigned stronger accounts. New employees not willing to hustle and prove themselves do not last. This is how every big company is in my experience. If you don't have a ton of sales experience, make sure you start at a lower title with a larger territory. Big companies are harder to ""learn the ropes at"", as you are competing with the best of the best for things like territory. Other than the above, Salesforce has been the best move in my career, and I'm thrilled and proud to work here. I've never found a place without the above cons, and the pros far outweigh them for me."
6035,"As a big company constantly going through growth phases, it's challenging to align across so many engineering teams and business units, but Salesforce does an excellent job nevertheless, as shown by our customer enthusiasm and Dreamforce debuts."
6051,"Getting to be a ""big company"" with the big company type of red-tape, no 360 degree review process, so some senior managers are able to treat their people cannon fodder and without accountability as long as they make their numbers or ""manage up"" and show a good face to the senior boss above them."
6055,"As with any big company, the team you are on can drastically change your experience here but I am going to try to point out some of the general things. Also of note, before you read too much into the other reviews, take the time to notice how many of the 5 star reviews are can be summed up by ""great place to work but has growing pains"" or ""you get what you put in, slackers need not apply"". I will let you draw your own conclusion on why so many of these reviews sound like marketing message .... It doesnt look like ExactTarget understands that they are no longer a startup. The only people that thrive at ExactTarget are people that have no lives. 50+ hours of work a week is the norm and anyone that does less is considered a ""slacker"" as you might have seen in some of these other reviews. If you do the math, you'll realize that the decent paycheck, which is typically higher than the industry norm, ultimately falls woefully short when you look at how much you make an hour. As you work here, you come to find out that it is very much a cult mindset and you are either in or out. Job security comes from owning tribal knowledge of projects that are integrated in to the platform since documentation is apparently a running joke. There are many processes that have been implemented to ""streamline"" development but apparently the management style here is to implement ""solutions"" and ignore the results because the only thing that these processes have done is add one more point of failure to an already broken system. Contractors are treated as second class citizens. Its common knowledge. The way to get ahead is to brown nose and give up on life outside work. ET is founded on the principle that the reward for a job well done is an opportunity to do more. After the Salesforce acquisition morale and productivity have been at an all time low while frustrations and turn over have been on the other side of the scale."
6068,"Beginning to get much more ""big company"" - more red tape, etc just to get the job done."
6074,"""Fillers"". I call them ""fillers"" because that's what they are...people that were hired in haste to simple fill roles in an organization that is growing so fast, they had to be hired quickly. While they may have gone through multiple rounds of interviews, it seems there are many execs that got through that shouldn't have and are just filling a role in the org chart. And they don't do s*&^. They may have had extremely successful positions at other companies, but Salesforce isn't like other companies. They only slow you down...so if you're smart and have your i's dotted and t's crossed, just go over them and it's not really looked down upon. Tomorrow. You're only as good as the deal you have committed tomorrow. Doesn't matter if you're at 200% of quota for the year 6 months into it ...that actually only amplifies what is expected of you. It's a con...but in reality...it's also not too bad...unless you're in a Sales role that isn't an AE (i.e. SE) because you're capped. Salesforce has the SE's I've ever come across in the industry, and I don't think they're treated as fairly as they should be. Marketeering. This is a new issue at Salesforce... It used to be the case that marketing & PM were in line and no one sold on futures. Over the past 12 months, that has changed...moving closer to an Oracle-like model where the vision is pitched and then they try to build it. Equity. I'm not sure who is getting it, but it isn't long term sales people. Seekingalpha? They couldn't be more wrong. Granted, the ESPP program is fantastic, but once you get beyond entry level, it would be nice to see something. It can be disheartening to hear RVP's (in 2012 I swear they only brought in people as RVP's...""What? You're an RVP of WHAT? And have no reports?!?!?"") and other new employees talking about selling their RSU's or options when they haven't really done anything for the company yet and you've committed the better part of a decade. Commit. This is probably the biggest ""Con"" at Salesforce if you're an AE or in sales. Salesforce is an accurate machine...it really is...based on the subscription model, a great portion of deferred rev is already established and known...but they want your sales opps just as accurate and mgmt will force or override you on your deals if you think differently. Territory. Don't come to Salesforce thinking you'll be able to pick and choose. It was picked over 5 years ago. You'll more than likely get something you don't want. End of discussion. While it seems like it should be the biggest ""con"", it's not. Because everything I listed in the ""Pros"" section means you will constantly have something new and innovative to sell to that minuscule territory you have that no one else can. I mentioned in the ""Pros"" section that some of the long-termers (those that have been around 10+ years) are one of the best things about the company. They ARE. There are also a handful of high level execs that just need to go...they don't do anything...they show up at meetings and say hello and leave... and you better keep your mouth shut. It sucks. Because at one time they were amazing. Now, just awful."
6135,"Work-life balance is very much on the low side. If you are a remote employee it is very difficult to feel a part of the company, even when making regular trips back to Indy. You miss out on the big selling point of being and ExactTarget employee - the Orange Culture."

6177,"- As the company scales, it is also becoming a big more bureaucratic. Needs more levels of approvals in order to get things done. - Seems to focus more on Sales than the rest of the departments."
6188,"1. You have to bear hell of politics 2. It was different when I started but now many of managers lie about promotions, bonus and green card process I think they purposefully delay so that they can retain employees. If they know you can not switch then they will give not give raise or agreed bonus as well. It happened with me. 3. Its not a technology company. There are multiple CTOs, my group CTO does not even know current technologies, they try to solve big data problems using PL/SQL and will force you to do the same even if you know Hadoop technologies or other upcoming technologies. 4. The promotion is based on number of check-ins you can make and managers openly tell that. Its absolutely not related whether you checked in test or some stupid UI / xml fix or a routine to mine billions of events to generate recommendations. How dumb management can be in technical aspect? 5. Most of the product managers and product directors are jokers, they decide future product direction and design with no technical background. They talk about topic extraction using UI and static categories. 6. Its all gonna go downhill with a burst of existing big customers leaving because product is good but page load performance sucks big time or if good technology company comes as a competitor. Its just a matter of time when it is going downhill."

The biggest problem to me has been that the Senior Management is not always on a level that I would expect them to be. There is a lot of variance in how they set the expectations, support their subordinates and especially how they present themselves as leaders. Maybe it is bad luck or maybe I'm not the right fit for the company, but this has also made me consider my options with other employers."

7188,"Marketing marketing marketing. The company endlessly trumpets its supposed wonderfulness to the point where it feels like working in an endless commercial. There seems to be a huge push to constantly market the company both externally *and* internally; having the 'culture' shoved down our throats constantly. The company seems to spend an awful lot of money on fluffy extras (like pillows for all employees to put their mobile phones on at their desks, and professionally produced promotional videos for internal-only items) whilst asking employees not to use Roaming Data whilst abroad on business, and only allowing VPs to fly comfortably (some are more equal than others in this Ohana). PR touts Salesforce as a cutting edge company, but back-office systems are ancient and technology stacks are not integrated after years - there is a big disconnect between PR and reality, but the 'Ohana' papers over the cracks. Every All Hands address starts with 10 minutes of pom-pom waving cheerleading about how amazing we are. It gets tiresome."
7319,"Internal hire/promotions make less than external hires. Could be a big difference (Over 100k base - with accelerators/spiffs/bonuses it's worth over 300k difference in pay) Company is getting very big. The young start up, fast pace, and youthful vibe is gone. Lots of people from Oracle and white hair running the company. There are cliques. Usually between internal and external hires.

7501,"The company waivers between a startup culture and a big mature business culture. Some people thrive in one environment or the other, but Salesforce seems to have a little of both. For instance, travel approval requires multiple levels of approval up to a EVP; on the other hand, a phone call secured two programming resources to work on a really cool side project. The con is, I'm not sure what kind of response I'm going to get - startup or big company."
7512,Nothing unusual for a bigger company
7539,"Most of the cons can be summed up by growing pains. The rate of growth at times creates confusion and certainly poses organizational and system challenges. Salesforce is future focused and perhaps doesn't always take the time to look back to evaluate past performance, instead preferring to move on to the next big thing. The result is that sub-optimal processes don't always get corrected. As the company has grown, a lack of focus on small details results in some areas of the business suffering until something serious occurs that draws attention to it. Salesforce is unabashedly a Customer Company. When given the choice to pivot to Customers, Shareholders, or Employees, the company will always choose Customers. This has resulted in the past with some haphazard and poorly though-through HR decisions. Lots of Employee-related initiatives seem to be thrown together at the last minute."
7540,"- Pace: simply put, the frenetic company growth is unsustainable. At its peak, think of back-to-back 80 hour weeks, juggling 6 tasks at once, back-to-back meetings & calls to get the job done properly. Annual quotas that continue to go up isn't something that go on forever, right? - Management: The company is growing so fast, first-line managers are going to be the weakness that cripples this company. Not saying there aren't good managers, but there are a lot of bad ones. To fill the void, Salesforce hires externally (i.e. Oracle) who brings their less-than-desirable practice into Salesforce. Lack of homegrown leadership is the company's biggest weakness, by far - Customers get tired: We all hear our customers are tired of getting ""nickled & dimed to death"" because we keep on coming out with new features, new acquisitions, new bundles that cost ""only $xx more per user/month""."
7547,"Like at any enterprise tech company, the work is big and complex. With responsibility over projects that affect hundreds to thousands of people, balancing work priorities and personal life can feel a bit rocky at times. Fortunately, there is always a bright mind to turn to for help and no shortage of motivated, hard-working people around you to get the job done and have a little fun while doing it."
7562,"New AE product enablement is embarrassingly bad. The first 12 months are sink or swim, and aside from self-enabling yourself, the territories are hit or miss. Sales reps that have crushed their quota at other companies often struggle due to poor territory carves and slow enablement ramp time. Furthermore, Marketing Cloud basically acts as its own company within Salesforce. Collaboration with the CRM business is weak at best, and Marketing Cloud's biggest competitor has been its own internal solution, Pardot. Last, sales managers here are mostly just that, managers. True leaders in management are few and far between. For example, struggling AEs are mostly on their own to figure it out, which is resulting in higher AE turnover."
7590,"I had a very bad manager who harassed me mentally everyday till I left the company. No support for an employee from the HR. Manager went to a point to insult me in various 1-1s. No exit interview, no one to talk to if you are being casted out since managers and senior management is all a big group of friends who cant be touched."

7661,"(1) Frequent Re-orgs: Salesforce's ""secret"" to success is to be ruthlessly customer-focused ... as it should be. This means that everything is done to make sure we continue to grow ... again as it should be. This means however that re-orgs are quite frequent and also the employee-turnover. (2) Title inflation: When I accepted the job offer, I thought I would make a career progression, which it was title wise, but after I joined I realized that I had in fact less responsibility than before. This wasn't obvious to me because the compensation was considerably higher than at my previous company. I wished I had asked more questions and had asked for a higher title. (3) No cafeteria at HQ: you need to leave the building to grab food. This by itself is not a big issue. In fact, it means you have so many different lunch options ... every day. Yet, the ability to socialize with co-workers within your team and more importantly outside your team is not as easy as at companies where there is a common lunch area. At my previous company, lunch break was an opportunity to run into people and have a quick chat, which was helpful for maintaining relationships."

7746,"Underneath the facade, Salesforce is focused on perception more than reality. VTO isn't volunteer time off at all. It's voluntold time on-top (of existing work load) for most of the company. We have targets for VTO set, but many business units aren't staffed appropriately to actually take the time off. Instead it's just adding work load on top of our existing work load. Also, the company really exemplifies the wealth gap, with those at the top heavily rewarded with expensive trips, awards (including cars, watches, etc.) while the majority of the company is paid somewhere around the 75th percentile of industry. We once had a travel freeze but the company still sent the top 100+ employees to a big shindig in Hawaii - and they broadcast it and insisted that everyone across the company ""tune in"" to it remotely. Wow."

7808,"Transitioning from start-up to big corporation, execs are young and eager to please parent company in Cali by kissing up while transferring the stress to employees. Zero tolerance for mistakes but not giving any warning sign until the last minute before they fire you. Due to poor location excellent employees are few and far between, so mediocre but ass-kissing people get to stay. Managers are all great players of politics. Employees don't dare to speak their mind just to keep their jobs in the ""best"" company of the area. Mid-level people managers have no clue in managing so resort to micromanagement. Typical ""boys club"" culture with no advancement opportunity for female. Only those who play well with their managers and drink the Salesforce cool-aid will thrive. The V2MOM is a joke as performance review has nothing to do with it, meaning delivering results doesn't mean you are good enough. Fear of mistakes and risk averse mindset is suffocating the humanity and innovation this company once had."
7816,"It is a big company, and knowledge transfer is always tricky. I suspect that there is a bit of duplicity that goes on in engineering, and there are definitely things that parts of the business have learned that other parts of the business could be greatly benefited from but don't know anything about."

Re-orgs happens without a reason and the new management whoever joins tend to shakes good amount of teams without knowing what they are upto and how it will impact the company and individuals.

7949,"But everything is built on empty promises and software that doesn't actually work or get implemented. Salesforce was supposed to be a different kind of company, but it has become Oracle! We talk about customer success but no one actually cares about customer success. We care about signing big deals and pulling a fast one on the customer. This is going to catch up to the company eventually! Men get promoted if they are political, kiss up, and stab people in the back. Women get promoted if they sleep with the right men."
7985,"As with any big company, the team you are on can drastically change your experience here but I am going to try to point out some of the general things. Also of note, before you read too much into the other reviews, take the time to notice how many of the 5 star reviews are can be summed up by ""great place to work but has growing pains"" or ""you get what you put in, slackers need not apply"". I will let you draw your own conclusion on why so many of these reviews sound like marketing message .... It doesnt look like ExactTarget understands that they are no longer a startup. The only people that thrive at ExactTarget are people that have no lives. 50+ hours of work a week is the norm and anyone that does less is considered a ""slacker"" as you might have seen in some of these other reviews. If you do the math, you'll realize that the decent paycheck, which is typically higher than the industry norm, ultimately falls woefully short when you look at how much you make an hour. As you work here, you come to find out that it is very much a cult mindset and you are either in or out. Job security comes from owning tribal knowledge of projects that are integrated in to the platform since documentation is apparently a running joke. There are many processes that have been implemented to ""streamline"" development but apparently the management style here is to implement ""solutions"" and ignore the results because the only thing that these processes have done is add one more point of failure to an already broken system. Contractors are treated as second class citizens. Its common knowledge. The way to get ahead is to brown nose and give up on life outside work. ET is founded on the principle that the reward for a job well done is an opportunity to do more. After the Salesforce acquisition morale and productivity have been at an all time low while frustrations and turn over have been on the other side of the scale."
7986,"As a big company, it was harder to get things done. Executives are not always in sync. It seems they prefer to hire from the outside rather than promote from within. Lots of changes going on these days."
7998,"I've worked in the Salesforce ecosystem for over 10 years and I'm probably going to leave. I've been working at the company less than two months--albeit as a contract employee (although my title is technically ""Agency Temp--so sad, and the reason this even matters is one of the security questions when you call Global Services (the help desk) which I had to do 9 times in my first two days because of PC problems (and I'm not kidding.) is ""What is your title?"" I'm not really a person keen on titles but ""Agency Temp"" doesn't describe my expertise or skill set and it certainly made me feel like a second class citizen. Maybe it's because I'm not a big company person. I also heard ""contractors don't get desks"" Nice. That's not legal. So buyer beware. My agency on-boarding was also horrific. My commute into the city is terrible. I love SFDC and have made my living around it. I don't want to sour on it and think I can make a bigger impact at a client. I am also surrounded by two extremes--other Agency Temps and super stars who have been there for years who stick together. In addition, my boss is remote, extremely busy and they ""sold to me"" is the dog they start everyone on which has stalled for a year and half."

8056,big company so you can get lost
8097,"I mean...it's hard to know where to start but I'll try to do my best. First, a lot of people talk about career and promotions - and how there's little to know transparency about the process, nepotism is rampant and the like. The company knows this, which is why ES has done away with giving performance reviews. Now, instead of being clear on what exactly you need to do to move up the chain, they're putting this on you. The result is that many people get promoted solely for political/favoritism , and people who actually have technical skills can get lost if there is no one mentoring them on how to play the game. And as other people have mentioned, employees do get rated by their managers every year, but they never see the results of their evaluation. The typical ES response to this will be ""Salesforce is not for everyone"" - but this should not take the place of transparency around the promotion process, especially in a company that touts itself on being transparent in every other way. The whole situation is a really messed up way of dealing with the fact that there are too many talented and driven people here. Work life balance, especially in regional roles, is nonexistent. During a regional rotation, I was actually paid less than my San Francisco salary per our mobility policies, but I was expected to lead projects in San Francisco AND the regional location. The result was 15-18 hour days, 6 days per week. Even though I discussed the concerns I had with my manager, their response was the typical ""Maybe Salesforce just isn't for you."" The situation did finally get better after I sought legal advice, and realized that this type of working structure was actually illegal per the local environment. However, it was clear that the escalation was seen as politically incorrect, and the regional rotation quickly became a dead end with no career growth or development. I was lucky enough to find a team in San Francisco that was willing to take me as a way out, but I share this as a cautionary tale for anyone considering taking on a similar role. Make sure you have a good local attorney, as many teams at Salesforce are predatory, and see the rotational experience as a way to get you to take on more for less money - they will retaliate against you if you try to escalate concerns about your work environment (and on the other side, try getting anyone in San Francisco to take a call before 8am or after 5pm, and people will act like you're crazy - it's a complete double standard). Salesforce is going to start offering more and more roles like this outside of San Francisco to reduce costs, so be sure you know what you're getting yourself into and how you'll be supported if you take one of these on. Operations are a complete mess with many groups doing the same thing, each one trying to assert themselves. Ever since I've been here, there seems to be a focus on wellness, though this gets rebranded time and again as different initiatives. The end result is that people are super driven from 8-5, but cut corners so they can make it to that 5:30pm yoga class. I'm not saying people should work 24/7, but this is an example of how Salesforce and its culture often embody mixed messages (grow grow grow but make sure you have a balance). The result is a lot of groups who say ""This isn't my problem/I'm not owning it/Find someone else to talk to."" In a matrixed environment, this becomes really frustrating - especially as the company has gotten so much bigger. Ultimately, the Company is becoming larger and more bureaucratic - many employees are not receiving raises this year because the company wants to focus on bottom line growth at the expense of its people. At some point over the last 10 years, my day became 100% focused on managing the politics as opposed to creating value and focusing on work I enjoy. Because of this, I've decided to leave Salesforce after a long ride. It's bittersweet, but kind of like that song - ""You don't have to go home, but you can't stay here""; the writing is on the wall in terms of where this company is going - the culture has is getting more and more eroded with the growth. As a final word of warning, I will just encourage all potential candidates to take Salesforce marketing with a grain of salt. Salesforce is one of the only companies I know of that has an internal marketing team who is tasked with trying to tell you how you should feel about the company. Yes, it's true - they have done a lot of great things, but usually the motivation behind it is much more about showing how this initiative is part of the Salesforce brand, as opposed to genuinely providing assistance to someone or some organization that needs help."
8105,"Its a big company, growing fast, and good people can be overlooked. It has also become highly matrixed with a lot of crossover in roles & responsibilities."
8110,When I left I was observing some 'big company' dynamics emerge - meetings to decide on meetings. Not widespread but creeping in.
8119,"Big company politics are eroding individual morale and speed of innovation. In Technology & Products group, leadership that is not aligned, many big org changes have happened without any care for people's livelihoods. People are not happy and have been leaving at a steady stream. Also, they do not pay well for those that have tenure. Accept that outside hires for the same job (and even at a grade level lower) will earn more than you."
8134,"The culture is that of a big company, and success here is what you make of it. Nothing will be spoonfed, and it is up to the individual to sink or swim. Training is barebones(so seek out resources, and self motivate yourself to learn!), and many sales environments are hyper competitive. The organization is so big that there are redundant processes and internal politics, meaning that success here requires excellent externally facing and internally facing skills(or perhaps an opportunity to develop both for those starting their careers). For a company of this size, I don't think it is possible to avoid the aforementioned cons; that said, new employees who have only worked down or mid-market will need to adjust to a big company work environment, and won't receive much in the way of guidance as to how best to accomplish this."
8145,It's a big company so you don't have much influence on the business as an Account Executive. Very competitive and success in sales varies greatly by territories and timing.
8170,"The company is growing rapidly and it's tough to be in the loop on big decisions. Salesforce pivots to stay current, so if you can accept change, then you will fit in well here."
8171,"But everything is built on empty promises and software that doesn't actually work or get implemented. Salesforce was supposed to be a different kind of company, but it has become Oracle!

This is going to catch up to the company eventually! Men get promoted if they are political, kiss up, and stab people in the back. Women get promoted if they sleep with the right men."
8181,"After my long tenure and many Dreamforce conferences, I'm nearly fried. To say the culture is fast paced and the focus is always changing is an understatement. The reason Salesforce always seems on top, and chasing the latest trend, and in the press, is because employees are expected to run harder, carry more, cheer loudly, and pivot constantly. It's the world's biggest startup in behavior. But at the same time, with the recent influx of top career sales leaders from Oracle and what appears to be a board-level mandate for doubling revenue, employees are being asked to do even more with even less, fill higher quotas with smaller territories, less help, and the big company bureaucracy is rearing it's ugly head. Worse still is the politics. When you hire a bunch of smart, aggressive people, and put them in an environment of outsized expectations, throw in a bunch of re-orgs and changing management, and sprinkle with uncertainty and constantly changing priorities, you inevitably get people back stabbing each other and throwing others under the bus to appear smarter and more worthy of promotion. The few at the top will get very, very rich. The rest will lose the sense of personal ownership and start to wonder why they've given up health and family"
8204,It is a very big company
8212,"The vast majority of AE's were hired as hourly employees (you get a base salary but it's calculated hourly). Nearly every AE was recruited & led to believe that ""although your base salary appears low - you will make that up in overtime."" AE's work 50+ hours. This isn't an expectation - it's simply about owning your responsibilities required to do a good job for our customers. In the past, logging honest hours hasn't been an issue - AE's logged hours according to the work put in. This year however, it is ""48 hours or less...if you are logging more than 50 hours, you're not efficient"" .... This is concerning b/c it represents a subtle undertone of apathy to AE's. We were recruited under the notion we would be allowed to log the hours we worked. If the company is moving away from paying hourly, then the salaries should adjust accordingly - b/c this was the #1 negotiation tactic used by Salesforce recruiters to lowball base salaries. But again, the bigger concern here is how it makes AE's feel. We assume Salesforce looks out for our best interest, especially those putting in the extra hours to get the job done. It's one of the reasons Salesforce has been successful - we have a culture of execution."
8220,"""Fillers"". I call them ""fillers"" because that's what they are...people that were hired in haste to simple fill roles in an organization that is growing so fast, they had to be hired quickly. While they may have gone through multiple rounds of interviews, it seems there are many execs that got through that shouldn't have and are just filling a role in the org chart. And they don't do s*&^. They may have had extremely successful positions at other companies, but Salesforce isn't like other companies. They only slow you down...so if you're smart and have your i's dotted and t's crossed, just go over them and it's not really looked down upon. Tomorrow. You're only as good as the deal you have committed tomorrow. Doesn't matter if you're at 200% of quota for the year 6 months into it ...that actually only amplifies what is expected of you. It's a con...but in reality...it's also not too bad...unless you're in a Sales role that isn't an AE (i.e. SE) because you're capped. Salesforce has the SE's I've ever come across in the industry, and I don't think they're treated as fairly as they should be. Marketeering. This is a new issue at Salesforce... It used to be the case that marketing & PM were in line and no one sold on futures. Over the past 12 months, that has changed...moving closer to an Oracle-like model where the vision is pitched and then they try to build it. Equity. I'm not sure who is getting it, but it isn't long term sales people. Seekingalpha? They couldn't be more wrong. Granted, the ESPP program is fantastic, but once you get beyond entry level, it would be nice to see something. It can be disheartening to hear RVP's (in 2012 I swear they only brought in people as RVP's...""What? You're an RVP of WHAT? And have no reports?!?!?"") and other new employees talking about selling their RSU's or options when they haven't really done anything for the company yet and you've committed the better part of a decade. Commit. This is probably the biggest ""Con"" at Salesforce if you're an AE or in sales. Salesforce is an accurate machine...it really is...based on the subscription model, a great portion of deferred rev is already established and known...but they want your sales opps just as accurate and mgmt will force or override you on your deals if you think differently. Territory. Don't come to Salesforce thinking you'll be able to pick and choose. It was picked over 5 years ago. You'll more than likely get something you don't want. End of discussion. While it seems like it should be the biggest ""con"", it's not. Because everything I listed in the ""Pros"" section means you will constantly have something new and innovative to sell to that minuscule territory you have that no one else can. I mentioned in the ""Pros"" section that some of the long-termers (those that have been around 10+ years) are one of the best things about the company. They ARE. There are also a handful of high level execs that just need to go...they don't do anything...they show up at meetings and say hello and leave... and you better keep your mouth shut. It sucks. Because at one time they were amazing. Now, just awful."

8268,"Unfortunately as the company has grown exponentially, it has gotten that big company mentality and politics. From a sales standpoint, goals have become unreasonable and territories have shrunk ridiculously. Ask what percentage of the reps are making quota. I suspect company wide it is less than 25% but management would never say. Very hard to make money these days at SFDC. Voluntary turnover in 2013 was insane (sales reps). Leadership from Oracle coming over in herds pushing Oracle mentality...not good unless you like that kind of thing."
8329,"If you agree to special projects your career may stagnate rather than grow. The newish job definitions created transparency, but don't always benefit the employee or the company when something outside of the box is needed.

Taking that big bet stretch assignment will bench you career-wise."

8556,"Equality (Pun intended): IN spite of one of the core values of the company being Equality, the organization is RIFE with inequality. It first starts with who gets a seat at work. A company that boasts of technology and how they help businesses, they have no idea of what their growth is or will be. The tech teams grow inorganically leaving all the other teams to cram into rooms. There is clear discrimination right from senior leadership on who gets a seat and who does not. Tech teams are treated like kings and no one ( including the CTO)has the power to change their minds. There is a very heavy tone of ""ENTITLEMENT"" when any one approaches these tech teams or in discussions with them , something the company is very proud of. Even the facility team listens to what the leaders have to say and implement them. The Internal communication board even has a forum for people to vent, that is a great place for humor, with people complaining about the flavor of yogurt served in the fridge and many more trivial things.This (in)equality is not just limited to seating options but to pay, travel benefits and how they are treated by the infamous HRBP's ( or the human resources) They too clearly are unequal to teams, paying full attention to Tech teams and quite clearly ignoring smaller teams. I have met my ESBP twice till now ( official meetings) in my entire tenure as they are too busy taking care of the bigger teams. And who is there to ask them or question them, no one!! They seem to be the busiest team in the office while none of them are visible in the office post 4PM, imagine now when it is virtual. Talk about an easy job in Salesforce. Then there is a great term that they keep using ""OHANA"" like from an episode of Black Mirror they want to make sure you get sucked in to the idea of ,while the company really does not care. BTW that means' Family"" in Hawaiian, while no one is treated like one. Just giving people a lot of cupcakes and goodies( SWAG as they call it) is only marketing their company and the employees lap it up like puppies with a new chew toy. This is what the company's idea of a family is, give them stuff that is absolutely unnecessary and make them feel like they get ""SO MUCH"". Employees need to be bribed to fill up surveys, because well they don't do anything without a ""gift"". Any one who is planning to work for this organization should be particular about their ethics policies, which is an absolute joke.I am aware of some employees who were victims of this team, they either did not get justice for their complaint or were terminated for wrong decisions. I wish I had that kind of job where I can decide peoples' fates based on whims and fancies and no one to answer to. I strongly believe they have monthly targets to get people off the rolls! I know the HR team will scramble and get this review off this platform in an instant ( BTW one of the other values of the company is transparency). India offices are filled with wrong leaders and sadly nothing from the above will change."

8703,"big company, lots of people, hard to navigate sometimes"
8724,"As any big company, there is a lot of information around and it is sometimes difficult to find the right information for your need."
8736,"Marketing marketing marketing. The company endlessly trumpets its supposed wonderfulness to the point where it feels like working in an endless commercial. There seems to be a huge push to constantly market the company both externally *and* internally; having the 'culture' shoved down our throats constantly. The company seems to spend an awful lot of money on fluffy extras (like pillows for all employees to put their mobile phones on at their desks, and professionally produced promotional videos for internal-only items) whilst asking employees not to use Roaming Data whilst abroad on business, and only allowing VPs to fly comfortably (some are more equal than others in this Ohana). PR touts Salesforce as a cutting edge company, but back-office systems are ancient and technology stacks are not integrated after years - there is a big disconnect between PR and reality, but the 'Ohana' papers over the cracks. Every All Hands address starts with 10 minutes of pom-pom waving cheerleading about how amazing we are. It gets tiresome."

9585,Great company but becoming too big for it's own good. Some of middle management is not very well qualified but are there by chance - timing. Can have a very Bro culture.
9613,Things change really fast here. One moment you are working on something and the next you will be working on something else. Some accumulated technical debt as the company is growing way too fast. Benefits are slightly below average compared to the other big names.
9672,"Big company, big tape. Yes we still are the world largest startup, but there are process in place that will test your patience at times."
9695,Management is rarely happy even when you close a big deal because they want you selling all of the products even when it doesnt make sense for the customer. They push product down customer's throats even though they call themselves a 'customer company.' Every month feels like it's end of quarter or end of year and managers care more about following the sales playbook versus helping you close the deal.
