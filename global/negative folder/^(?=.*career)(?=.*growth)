346,No proper career growth for employees

403,"- Completely focuses on sales, nothing else. All that matters to them is hitting quarterly numbers. - High Churn of people due to lack of training, management and high pressured cooker demanding instant results. - Poor leadership in place - often people who have done well put into management positions with no exp or people skills. - Zero career development and growth. - No culture - you will just be another number. - Many people unresponsive and hiding. - Very political and packed with egos. - management seem to ignore and look down on more junior employees as beneath them. - Poor communication to employees."
703,Lacking on the maturity curve with Largest accounts. Every client is treated the same whether they spend $10k or $10mil. Management is typically not investing in employee skill sets and career growth. Its all about Sales and the weekly numbers.
820,"political sometimes too many metrics which make no sense career growth may not be great after a few years, my advice - kill yourself for a few years, gain good exposure, then leave"
939,All IT is centralized in SFO region. If you want career growth then you have to move to SF region.
1235,- Rapid growth and change has blurred career path - Most opportunity is in San Francisco; Need more opportunity outside to reflect a global company - Growth has challenged culture
1594,Frequent Org change Management does't care much about employee career growth
1632,"become very political and hierarchical , hard to move around the org, people and need to manage up for career growth, promotion process is horrible - centered around gossip from ICs and managers making it not transparent - shame to see as it has only really developed in the last 2 years"
1844,Domain restriction when lookibg at career growth
1927,"The Security organization (Security Assurance specifically) is going through an identity crisis with a hazy long term vision to support a changing engineering org. Without a clear vision and direction, the focus is on fire fighting and operational day-to-day tasks. The culture never recovered from the DefCon/Meat Pistol incident and leadership turnover. Lately, there seems to be high turnover in more senior Security Assurance engineers due to slowed career growth, increasing workload, and less competitive compensation."
2035,"It's a big organization and it's very easy to get lost You have got to do extra-credit to become noticed (ERG leadership roles, work around the clock, raise your hand for extra work, etc.) You have got to own your career without a shout of doubt; no one is responsible for your success but you. This might not necessarily be a con but I think my growth has been a bit more facilitated by past managers in previous jobs than here."
2084,- Increasing growth of middle management and more executive leaders without clear roles/responsibilities. - Many teams do the same thing under different names. It's confusing how many teams you need to work with to get something simple accomplished. - Inconsistent leadership - some leaders focus more time on managing-up versus ensuring their people are successful. I've had amazing leaders and mentors but also horrible leaders who marginalize their people. - No clear path for IC career growth. Salesforce gets very political with people garnering for expanded responsibility and headcount - not focused on performance.
2105,"Cliques, say one thing and do another, no career growth/development, ""positive"" culture except behind closed doors, not very innovative because there are too many layers of approval and yes people, very reactive versus strategic, the PMM org is really all about who you know and telling leadership what they want to hear (literally every quarter the great leader survey shows the disconnect between the worker bees and the leadership, but nothing changes even when they make you attend ""feel good"" meetings about wanting to hear what they can do differently). P.S. I'd recommend to a friend with strong caveats."
2421,"Not great at cultivating and nurturing talent. As an individual, you have to be driven to take your career and growth into your own hands. No one is going to hand-hold you through it."
2457,"The Culture in the Chicago office took a nose dive this year. With fast growth a lot of the wrong people were promoted to leadership positions and have sucked some of the life out of the organization. (On the plus side things move fast so they probably wont be in those roles for too much longer). Their is also a clear political path to success, be liked by the group that is running the show and you will be rewarded with a greater share of the potential sources of commission compared to your peers (There is a loosely defined territory policy which can either be a huge benefit or detriment to your career). The downside is that it appears most of the ""have's"" already have been selected."

3367,"This dump hole has lately been practising a highly unethical and toxic culture of late-night events and parties hosted by D***** Manthri (I guess that’s the only time left with the employees since there is no work-life balance :-D) where female staff (including married women) are expected to stay back till late night 2 to 3 PM , and denying to do so would directly factor in impeding their career growth thereafter. Also, they are NOT EVEN PROVIDED A CAB RIDE TO HOME with a security personnel - a practice which is followed even by smaller companies where women leave late at night from the office. This is a clear indication of denigration. Please stay away from such US-based firms, especially Salesforce, Bangalore"
3493,These cons are specific to the HR Department. Other teams seemed to have been functioning ok. No work like balance Overwhelming stress Leadership is not responsive to feedback/needs of the team Low morale Micromanaging Low pay with a lot of work Not rewarding or promotion/career growth opportunities
3667,"Due to size and growth, it's very difficult to make an impact in the middle ranks. Politics are hard to navigate. While top leaders (Marc Benioff and Brett Taylor) demonstrate the fun of the culture and sincere dedication to core values, I can't say the same about middle management. A great place to start your career or have a VP or above role."
3672,Slower career growth. Promotion is really manager and org dependent
3748,Hard for career growth Favorites continued to get promoted
3959,"not much career growth, low efficiency due to tech frameworks ."
4031,"Very political, flattening growth, limited career opportunities outside of Sales or Engineering"

4425,"As someone whose been with the company many years, it has transitioned from a smaller, agile, product-focused company to a Marketing and Sales holding company that does little or no product development. Nearly every major product announcement over the last few years featured huge fanfare, but resulted in the product dying a quiet end within 2 years. Pretty much every major product announcement now is just a Marketing 're-alignment', rebranding existing products, not actually developing anything new. All innovation is bought, not developed internally, and there is little sign that the various acquisitions (Mule, Tableau, Slack) are actually creating a 2+2=5 effect. It really feels like a bunch of independent companies that are owned by the same conglomerate. The focus on growth by acquisition also means very limited growth opportunities internally since the existing products aren't really growing or innovating significantly, it isn't creating new positions. A new, related phenomenon is that in order to retain talent, many low-to-middle managers are getting 'promotions in place', i.e. they are getting a bigger title and more money without additional responsibility because their orgs aren't growing. So you see lots of VPs with only two directs who are also VPs, creating lots of unnecessary layers of management who all feel they have to micromanage those below them in order to show they are 'adding value'. This lack of organic growth means a lot of people are attritting because they don't see any real career path. Career development isn't a focus beyond the first line of management. After that its all operations, process and programs. Manager success is evaluated on how many programs did you develop and market, not how many employees did you develop or how productive and happy is your team. Another issue is the split between the company image and Sales. While I do think a lot of product and engineering people do really believe in the company values, remember, this is a company founded by a Sales Guy. There is a very cutthroat sales mentality inherited from Oracle that often sees sales reps and leaders blatantly ignore values like trust, equality and customer success in order to hit their quarterly number. Sales is really the #1 value. The large and not rationalized product stack means that often sales reps are pitted against each other because they have overlapping products, and the result can be the customer gets the product of the better rep, not the product they need. Many products are 'zombie' products with no future product development and virtually no support staff, but because there are reps with quota on them, they are still being sold despite the fact that the customer will likely attrit in a couple of years once they realize they've been sold a lemon. Turnover in the Sales org also means a lot of inexperienced account execs who have zero understanding of the products or the company culture but are still being put on big accounts. Over and over you'll hear how solutions teams are the most vital part of the sales organization, but every award, spiff or shoutout goes to the sales rep. You'll hear about some amazing demo that sold the deal but the only names you will here are 5 different reps/AEs, like they did all the work themselves. They'll pat themselves on the back, go off to sales club and collect a massive commission and the SE will get back to work. Another thing most new employees won't notice at first because they just got their nice offer package, is that Salesforce hires at much higher dollar amount than it pays existing employees. Pretty much every new hire will make a LOT more than everyone else on a team. It's joked repeatedly that if you want a raise or promotion, your best option is to leave the company and get re-hired in a year. Stock is incredibly stingy. Unlike most tech companies that do yearly refreshes, you will be lucky to get new RSUs every 3-4 years, even for very top performers. Many relatively senior employees (15+ years overall experience, 4+ with company) have NO stock. A team of 10 might get 2-3 stock refreshes in a year. This is the #1 retention tool, and yet Salesforce consistently lags behind all competitors here. A lot of lip-service is given to the 'giving back' part of the company. When I joined this was for real. You got a week of VTO time, and if you used all that you'd get a sizeable grant to give to a charity of your choice. They removed the grants a few years ago without making any real announcement. The VTO time is still there but if you are above a certain level, you are on 'unlimited' PTO (which means you can take what you want, but only if your manager is cool AND you don't feel guilty about taking off during whatever crisis is currently happening). This makes the VTO time meaningless, since it just gets blurred in with PTO and sick leave."
4657,"People end up getting stuck there, career growth in limited, very siloed teams."
4797,- I am not sure what promotion opportunities/career path looks like for me at this time but with the speed and scale of growth I am hopeful for more opportunities for me in the future
4799,"No career path or growth and terrible compensation. Nobody has a clear Understanding of responsibilities. Terrible management, there is little to no support from them. Low morale as a result of all of this."
5117,"Comp plans reward AE's, SE's not so much. High growth causes issues with quality of mid level management HQ/SF focus, remote employees seem to have a harder path to success Incredible title inflation, over thousand+ VPs Co-prime bus rolling into complex deals creates competing goals Need to proactively manage your career or you may get run over."
5176,- Solution Engineering turning into Nepotism based growth path - First time in my career here I felt I am back to the starting line - Al(most) ex-CBU members favored for promotions and next level positions - No career coaching/path programs. Cannot do everything using Trailhead
5477,"Very fast-paced growth in a large organization, which can result in the working environment being sometimes stressful Lack of a structured and clear career progression program - even if this is being taken care of"
5478,"Poor management with no sense of leadership, have to manage up and be highly political which is tough due to the lack of trust and accountability. Most managers don't have an interest in developing, coaching or helping their team. They are paid on the performance of a territories growth and not individual success so as long as they are hitting YOY targets, which means they aren't concerned about individual success. Success is heavily dependent on the territory and winning the ""Salesforce lottery."" People seem friendly but are very exclusive with only your ""brand"" being the leverage you have for success-- even if you are performing well or the hardest working. If you are looking to move verticals etc.. you can easily be blocked by your manager if they want to keep you for their self-interests. The management has created a self-serving environment where people don't really care or want you to have a fulfilling career. You will be shunned and humiliated in front of others if you speak up. It is not encouraged to give honest feedback."
5535,Middle management needs improvement Internal career growth has not be good - I see a lot of hiring of middle management from outside instead of growing internal people Priority changes frequently at the lower level even with a clear big picture at the top Lots of political land mines to navigate Work life balance is given lip service but must be defended by the individual (probably related to poor middle management)
5555,"-Like some people have said, the priorities change too much -Not much opportunity for career growth after two to three years"
5557,"political sometimes too many metrics which make no sense career growth may not be great after a few years, my advice - kill yourself for a few years, gain good exposure, then leave"

5773,"Politics at leadership is relentless. Landscapes can change over night with senior leaders getting fired and new leadership coming in and throwing everything out of the window including nearly approved promotions for top talent and hiring decisions. Ohana is a lie. DE&I eye wash , lots of talk never practiced. Senior Management practices everything that others are taught not to do like hiring only friends and family to senior roles, not being transparent and not focusing on people's careers. There is no scope for growth unless you're in the club, so be prepared to be where you are for years with no work life balance and constant pressure. Attrition"
6170,"- Getting top heavy in terms of mgmt, not enough people to do the actual work - Too much hiring of outside senior leadership has stunted career growth and opportunities for long timers - Departments are getting to be huge silos and have distinctly different culture, politics, etc and have lost sight of the company ideals of transparency, volunteerism and most importantly FUN!"
6248,- Rapid growth and change has blurred career path - Most opportunity is in San Francisco; Need more opportunity outside to reflect a global company - Growth has challenged culture
6327,"Extremely large organization, limited room for upward career growth"
6492,Limited career path in Customer Success Group Rapid growth combined with steady acquisitions complicates collaboration
6527,-Little to no career growth -Politics -Management quality
7005,Growth at this scale is a challenge in terms of org structure and career development. The company is addressing these while steaming ahead with growth. This inevitably will not lead to a perfect solution but that is the whole part of being in a growth business.
7174,"Too much interference from regional HQ limiting your plans. Lot of lost opportunities if you are not working out of a regional HQ. Your manager controls your career growth, not necessarily your performance."
7253,"Applicable only to India team and for the time period this review is written for, - Non technical, director with no salesforce certification and poor knowledge of salesforce products and business. - The above makes this individual a poor leader for a technical team. Under this leadership, the India team has a sluggish growth to their careers. - Unrealistic targets and workloads are set for the team which led to long working hours and high pressure high stress work environment. - Work done here is boring, low impact and repetitive. There was no career defining work in this team for the time this review was written. - Management is a bully, openly threatening and humiliating team mates. Several incidents of this have occurred. But employees are too frightened of retaliation to bring out the issue. - Top down policies and decisions. Team mates have no voice and have to follow all decision leadership makes. - High stress environment created by an autocratic leadership. - Team is expected to work long hours and weekends. - Team are heavily monitored and micromanaged. Egs if you do not clock in by 9 am you will be called out in an email, in a public meeting and reported to HR. - Management is indifferent to creating career growth paths for its team members who do not want to become Solution Engineers. - Limited slow promotions, terrible hikes and highly gated pathways for internal transfer. Management claims that Demo Engineers are highly regarded in the company, yet demo engineers are not top choice for internal transfers, in India. - The leadership of India team creates unofficial policies that are against the overall organisation policies. Examples are non-reimbursement of failed attempts at certification. Use of whatsapp as an official communication channel, tho it is explicitly banned by salesforce. - Skip levels are highly discouraged. These are a threat to India management, in case of whistleblowers."

News flash: people are different in different parts of the country and the rest of the world. Company needs to just admit they are the same as other giant corporations. - No longer feels like a innovative/entrepreneurial/start-up company (Now we just buy those kinds of companies, even if it doesn't make sense. I'm looking at you Quip.) - The company has never told a customer no, even when they needed to do so and the company is feeling it - Company seems to reward bad client behavior instead of correcting it - I am tired of typing but there are definitely more cons than pros"
7669,- I am not sure what promotion opportunities/career path looks like for me at this time but with the speed and scale of growth I am hopeful for more opportunities for me in the future
8097,"I mean...it's hard to know where to start but I'll try to do my best. First, a lot of people talk about career and promotions - and how there's little to know transparency about the process, nepotism is rampant and the like. The company knows this, which is why ES has done away with giving performance reviews. Now, instead of being clear on what exactly you need to do to move up the chain, they're putting this on you. The result is that many people get promoted solely for political/favoritism , and people who actually have technical skills can get lost if there is no one mentoring them on how to play the game. And as other people have mentioned, employees do get rated by their managers every year, but they never see the results of their evaluation. The typical ES response to this will be ""Salesforce is not for everyone"" - but this should not take the place of transparency around the promotion process, especially in a company that touts itself on being transparent in every other way. The whole situation is a really messed up way of dealing with the fact that there are too many talented and driven people here. Work life balance, especially in regional roles, is nonexistent. During a regional rotation, I was actually paid less than my San Francisco salary per our mobility policies, but I was expected to lead projects in San Francisco AND the regional location. The result was 15-18 hour days, 6 days per week. Even though I discussed the concerns I had with my manager, their response was the typical ""Maybe Salesforce just isn't for you."" The situation did finally get better after I sought legal advice, and realized that this type of working structure was actually illegal per the local environment. However, it was clear that the escalation was seen as politically incorrect, and the regional rotation quickly became a dead end with no career growth or development. I was lucky enough to find a team in San Francisco that was willing to take me as a way out, but I share this as a cautionary tale for anyone considering taking on a similar role. Make sure you have a good local attorney, as many teams at Salesforce are predatory, and see the rotational experience as a way to get you to take on more for less money - they will retaliate against you if you try to escalate concerns about your work environment (and on the other side, try getting anyone in San Francisco to take a call before 8am or after 5pm, and people will act like you're crazy - it's a complete double standard). Salesforce is going to start offering more and more roles like this outside of San Francisco to reduce costs, so be sure you know what you're getting yourself into and how you'll be supported if you take one of these on. Operations are a complete mess with many groups doing the same thing, each one trying to assert themselves. Ever since I've been here, there seems to be a focus on wellness, though this gets rebranded time and again as different initiatives. The end result is that people are super driven from 8-5, but cut corners so they can make it to that 5:30pm yoga class. I'm not saying people should work 24/7, but this is an example of how Salesforce and its culture often embody mixed messages (grow grow grow but make sure you have a balance). The result is a lot of groups who say ""This isn't my problem/I'm not owning it/Find someone else to talk to."" In a matrixed environment, this becomes really frustrating - especially as the company has gotten so much bigger. Ultimately, the Company is becoming larger and more bureaucratic - many employees are not receiving raises this year because the company wants to focus on bottom line growth at the expense of its people. At some point over the last 10 years, my day became 100% focused on managing the politics as opposed to creating value and focusing on work I enjoy. Because of this, I've decided to leave Salesforce after a long ride. It's bittersweet, but kind of like that song - ""You don't have to go home, but you can't stay here""; the writing is on the wall in terms of where this company is going - the culture has is getting more and more eroded with the growth. As a final word of warning, I will just encourage all potential candidates to take Salesforce marketing with a grain of salt. Salesforce is one of the only companies I know of that has an internal marketing team who is tasked with trying to tell you how you should feel about the company. Yes, it's true - they have done a lot of great things, but usually the motivation behind it is much more about showing how this initiative is part of the Salesforce brand, as opposed to genuinely providing assistance to someone or some organization that needs help."
