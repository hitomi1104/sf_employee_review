302,Managing work life balance is sometimes hard
308,"Career progression and salary increases are 100% related to the personal brand and not to quantifiable results, this leads people to abuse of the internal social networking platform and any other brown nosing opportunity for self promotion. This may be a plus if you have that attitude, otherwise you will find it frustrating. Due to this, management is represented by some excellent managers and others who are not but have been good in leveraging the above. Salesforce as a family: you are expected to be enthusiastic, participate and promote all sort of social events they serve you. Opting out of something you are not interested in lowers your personal brand. Work-life balance is hard: stressful days masked by great fun on social media, work in the weekend is not uncommon."
324,"- Depending on your role, your manager might not support the VTO during work hours - Depending on your role, you might not have any male salaries to compare against - The company and larger industry is still male-dominated, and you will still come up against entrenched sexism, this isn't utopia - ""Drinking from the fire hydrant"" is the work load. You either step up or leave during probation. If you do step up, you will reach your limit, then be overloaded again. If you're a workaholic and can balance that in a healthy way, great, but SFDC plays lip service to work-life balance in many departments. The work-life balance is often achieved through working from home while your family is asleep. - 99% of opportunities outside of the USA are sales-focussed"
328,"no worklife balance, hours busy"
357,"I have worked in other companies before and Salesforce seemed great in the beginning but its really the new Oracle in a disguise. * High turnover of staff * Nepotism / 'Boys Club' environment * No transparency * The internal promotion process is questionable * Cheating to hit targets, quid pro quo if you have a network * Management will not listen to feedback (expect that they turn it against you) * Hard to maintain work/life balance * Ohana is just marketing * Micro management * No lunch at all and the breakfast is just cereal * The office location is far away from the centre"
378,"-Reduced work-life balance due to bi-monthly business travels required to identify opportunities to build pipeline -Geographical distance from customers who are based in country -Growing sales teams means accounts per AE getting fewer with the targets not getting smaller -""Flexforce"" no seats assigned to AE -Weekly forecasting with monthly forecasts might not be suitable to everyone"
397,"- Poor work-life balance, it’s all about work. Late night messages and sometimes those bringing call for action for next morning.. And this is getting worse as all management layers feel the need to “contribute”.. - Customer success has changed to customer second; this is confirmed as common view in recent employee survey. It’s all about running the revenue up, on cost of some customers being outright screwed over under time pressure from us. It’s terrible to see this change, having been following this great company for many years. - You get promoted by making your numbers. You can be as disrespectful to Salesforce values as you wish to be, as far as the numbers are on the board. This is not a nice environment to work in. This is a shark tank.. - We are taught to be hustlers. We make stories of how great the prices are in certain month and how my manager has a budget for the extra discounts He would like to spend with you as a special customer. Big news: the discounts are always available for those willing to actually buy and there are no budgets for “special discounts”.. The only big diversion from this is January, when it truly is a buyers market. - It is high pressure, always. - Office is too full, and no home office allowed. - Ohana, trust, customer success - these are just words in Sales slides."

405,"- work/personal life balance: you need to be always on, even during vacation/outside of regular business hours - multiple acquisitions of other companies often requires modifying internal processes and structure (every fiscal year org structure seems to change - this may be a good or bad thing depending on your point of view)"

471,Difficult to maintain work/life balance
477,"Underpay compared to other technology companies in 'growth' mode. - managers focus strictly on numbers, little coaching or mentorship - work/life balance is a blurred line; focus hard on your numbers yet cap your working hours at 45 a week - moving away from flexible work hours and remote based employees - culture is no longer a focus"
493,"Work life balance in services non-existent. Company grew too fast to keep up with the great team dynamic that made it such a creative, exciting, progressive place to work. US did not understand non-US jurisdictions and had not desire to do so. US tried to make it an overly structured, regimented corporate when it's greatest asset was it's agile, non-conformist style that enabled creativity, intrapreneurship and great teamwork"
516,The reality of frequent late night+weekend work doesn’t match the promises of work/life balance
519,"Some disadvantages are coming from the advantages indeed: - It’s really difficult to make good money. Target are increasing and OTE are reflected based on global plans , so it depends a lot on how lucky you are you will be able to reach your targets. - You will have to manage the relationship not just with your direct reporting, but wih different stakeholders who will have different interests. As an example, different AEs from different vertical products interested in selling into the same account, different RVPs to manage with. Alignment is one of the most important words in the company. Some days you will finalise your day thinking about how 90% of your calls were to manage talks with colleagues and not customers/ partners. - Depending on the area you are focus in, territory can be really big or small. This comes with the maturity of the product in the market. Per example , Core products AEs are really focus in small territories, however new products in the Org (Mulesoft, Commerce ,...) counts with small teams yet. These AEs are focus in strategic deals and normally cannot support all the opportunities properly. At the end, quotas are increasing because of new products in the portfolio , but you cannot have the same level of support like in mature ones. So I would say it depends how lucky you are with an specific account your co prime could make a big piece of the quota. - I don’t personally believe you have to be the best sales person in the world to sell in Salesforce. Marketing investment and resources are super huge, some customers buy the vision and what they see in events many times , plus there is plenty of really experienced partners in the region. I would say your results at the end of the year will depend 30% of your work and 70% how lucky you are with your territory , maturity of your account and the work of your co-primes - If you like the start uptype of experience , this is not a place where you will be comfortable for a long time (I must confess smaller regions like Iberia are closer to a start up type of company thought ) However, sometimes you will have the feeling you will spend more time reporting, reading Quips, covering different events, than thinking strategically how to gain relationships, trust and projects. - This company can help you win good money, but reducing your health due to stress and long time at work. Work life balance is challenging. There is not an ending point , you will have to be really good Managing this point to have everyone happy : you (and your health , your closer family (that will have to be open on you travelling and spending long hours at work, and the company) This point is being really important. Some people are leaving , or thinking about doing it, because of this last reason. Retaining employees is key for the company. Many important people use to leave (mostly coming from the acquisitions) because they don’t get use to the way the company operates. A lot of people are ex oracles, this can creates a local culture where not anyone might be confortable with."

874,Hours are long. Could be more flexible with work life balance and family time.
882,The worst work life balance than any company I have worked for. They only care about growing revenue at any cost and the most short term focussed company. Employees have to turn around everything within 24 hours irrespective of personal priorities. Expected to work weekends with no compensation for long hours out in The Sales culture is a mess with large attrition as nobody wants to stay longer with such short term focus
900,"Before the Salesforce acquisition, SteelBrick was growing at an explosive pace. Since the acquisition, explosive growth is an understatement. With that said, everybody is running at breakneck speed and I think that (as a team) we're a bit worn down. If you join SteelBrick, be prepared to be pulled in a million directions all at once. Work / life balance is out of sorts. Right now (8/22/16), the CORE Salesforce team doesn't have much education on Q2C or understanding of product fit. This means we're talking with a lot of customers that are poor fit or having to field angry calls about why we ""killed"" a poorly qualified opportunity. I don't foresee this problem going away any time soon since Q2C is the most complex product offering in Salesforce's portfolio. There are a limited amount of SteelBrick-certified partners (~50), but customers insist on working with partners that have no experience implementing Q2C applications. This means that their implementations are taking longer than they should. There's nothing we can do about this since it's ultimately the customer's choice, but it puts unnecessary burden on our team. Customers come back during their implementation asking for support, but what they really want is implementation guidance. There is a lot of process change happening right now. For current employees, it's been pretty frustrating. I don't know if this has any barring on new hires, but it does make it difficult to get straight answers since we're all new to these processes as well."
907,Challenging to balance work and life
923,"Interestingly, what most excited me about Salesforce is what I found most lacking. I found the environment very sexist, male-dominated, negative, and non-inclusive. There is virtually no trust and I feel completely accurate in stating there is no work-life balance. You are collateral damage in the way to achieving a monthly quota. I left a paranoid, shattered professional with emotional scars I would equate to abuse. I'm sure not all experiences are the same as mine. I was unfortunate to land where I did within the organization. I know there are many folks who flourish there."
946,Lack of work/life balance in the sales organization
993,"Not always easy to have a work life balance, although they encourage you to. Your internal social network is key to succeeding and moving up (this is a pro for some). If you can't cut it, they will cut you."
1011,"Ultra micromanaged, terrible office morale, revolving door sales team. Leadership is out of touch and fills the day with ridiculous reporting and busy work. Consistent missing payments in your paycheck. You'll have to chase down every deal. Zero work / life balance."
1019,Worst life / work balance situation imaginable - and Sr Management does not care Only one raise in last 4 years Everyone is afraid to tell management the truth - Sr Management is extremely vindictive HR Dept offers no help to current employees People in the field are second class citizens to people at HQ
1031,"The workforce is not very diverse and the environment is all about doing what it takes to launch product without any thought to employee burn out. No work/life balance & their work from home policy is also misleading. Layers and layers of politics beyond anything you will ever experience (& I've worked for some large corporations but nothing like SFDC)! More often then not, people get promoted based on popularity & not on merit. Internal opportunities are few as they would rather backfill from outside rather than consider developing an internal candidate. I'm surprised at the number of people that say this company cares about their people as all the depts I've worked with including my own often referred to having a ""thankless job"" and the sentiment seemed consistent everywhere I went - the only exceptions are the employees that are fairly new to the company. I am a firm believer in giving back which is why volunteerism was an important criteria for me when seeking out employees. I was so disappointed to discover that my management saw volunteer hours as a game - ""log your hours and volunteer so we can beat the other dept....I will be checking hours by the end of the week"" This is disturbing!"
1079,"It's getting very political with the change of the guard to a more Oracle centric management team. Territories are thinly sliced and watered down unless you're in the good graces of your manager or the most senior person on your team, and if you're stuck with a bad one someone has to leave or get promoted for you to get a bigger slice. Work life balance is so/so...each manager determines if you can work from home with no real ""program"". Base salaries are below average in the industry."
1162,"inflexible work schedule and not a great work life balance,High level of micromanagement and lot of push on transactional cycles"
1210,work life balance is challenging. It is exciting but the strain of growing this quickly shows in operational areas and some of the things you would take for granted at more mature companies haven't evolved. Lots of initiatives to 'solve problems' internally go no where and are forgotten in a quarter
1211,"Workload is neverending. Sales expects teams to respond at all hours of the day. Support teams are not scaled along with the hiring growth. Company message that employees and work/life balance are valued is not consistent with the actual work environment. Long hours and pushes at quarter ends to close deals. Love the corporate culture drive to volunteer as a community and attend social events, but feel stressed by the time away from work hours and needing to make up the work after hours."
1213,"Terrible work-life balance, they expect long hours and push you extremely hard with not a lot of recognition or performance appreciation. They unfairly pay women employees even though there has been an effort to correct it. In the Sales organization is still a very close-knit boys club with no women leaders. Politics will get the best of you rather than actually focusing on getting the job done"
1216,"*Sharp learning curve, you sink or swim *With each acquisition, workload increased while team did not grow at the same rate *Work life balance was very difficult, you are expected to be on all the time *Inexperienced middle management *When something went wrong, little or no management support"
1307,"- You can feel ""left-behind"" here at times, so it's crucial to stay organized to keep up with the pace, especially early on. - Work-life balance (self-induced): it's easy to become attached to your work and your accounts, and it trickle over into your personal life after hours, or on weekends. - Difficult quota to hit, but that's for a reason. if this were easy I suppose they would let anyone in. Can't think of anything else. It's hard to find things wrong with Salesforce, in fact this section took me a lot longer to provide the bullet points above then the pros section."
1341,"This is not the place for people who are not willing to work hard and with full commitment and enthusiasm. Sometimes keeping the work/life balance is a bit hard, but management is fully supporting in trying to get it right"

1482,Boiler room. Not great work life balance
1486,"Information overload. Having an already impressive world of solutions, with new updates, apps, integrations, or products coming up every month, is almost impossible to stay on track about all you should know. The resources are limitless and helpful but you can get lost in a huge ocean of data that can lead to a little bit of desperation. Easy to fall in an only work mindset life, and it will be your fault, not the company's. Moving into Dublin (not the most exciting and cheap city in the world) for a job will already tell enough about you. This is a demanding job with a lot of freedom and perks from the company (the company and the management are the number 1 rest, holiday and work/life balance importance praisers) but if you want to do a good job and perform as you are coming here to, expect to work very long hours and days, especially in the beginning. Don't expect to be a free bird as you used to be, probably never. Targets are ambitious and so is your compensation and benefits, so expect to be tied tight and monitored on a very regular basis. With the working from home, it has been more accentuated that some might confuse it with micromanagement. Never is enough. Like any other sales company in the world, no matter how much you sell or work, you can always be asked to do little more. Take ownership of your pipeline and expect not to get the foot out of the gas pedal until the holidays break, no matter at which number you at. The party is almost over. If you are coming from an startup, you should see Salesforce as that older brother that used to be in all of the parties getting into its mid 30's. He knows what the fun is about but is now switching into a more responsible lifestyle and will only join those parties once a month let's say."
1515,Poor wage and work life balance

1831,"What they're doing is working at a business level. The company is a rocket ship, still. But it's at the expense of its people. Below are a few of the cons I find most frustrating. - Micro Management on an extreme scale. I joined just before the pandemic and it has gotten continually worse since being forced to work from home. You don't feel trusted. - Unrealistic workloads. - Encouraged to manage your work life balance but chastised if you actually do it. I've been scolded for having my car serviced at 2pm, or taking annual leave at a quarter cut off to celebrate a birthday. - Meetings for meetings sake burning precious time. - Saturated account sets. Prospects get bombarded continually from all angles of Salesforce and have been for over a decade. - Lead generation is down to you. You have to be BDR, AE and even SE on some opportunities, unless you're in the enterprise/strategic accounts. I have not had more than 3 leads passed to me in almost 18 months. - Always an ""urgent"" action that needs to be taken. Often which is not directly impacting your ability to engage with clients."
1859,work load and work life balance
1939,"- Training is terrible. They throw you into the territory and don't even cover products since ""you don't need to know what they are"". - Zero work/life balance. You'll get mental health days but that's after you've been working 9 hours a day and don't even get to log overtime for it. If you want space, you have to set it and hold to it. - Less than 30% of reps hit their quota and making money is more about lucky timing with SPIFFs than it is skill."
1976,"Finance department has some growing pains. Pretty sub-par culture with a bug lack of management on work load, project management, and more. Work-life balance out the window here. A big piece of the org is great, but there's some employees who haven't figured out a good management style to the detriment of the team"

2055,"super corporate, work/life balance is tough"
2122,"The push for productivity on top of enormous amount of learning material pushed on people here is unrealistic and stress inducing. During the pandemic more work was given than less. Getting a promotion requires you to push numbers rather than do work that benefits the team. All of the number fibbers and cherry pickers are the ones getting the back rubs here. Work/life balance is not respected all that much. It's stated that you should strive for a work/life balance, but the amount of work given does not allow it, and you'll usually find yourself frantically looking for extra time to fulfill work that's been unrealistically dumped on you. KPIs are unrealistic given the extension of some issues that customers raise. Upper management makes quick uneducated changes that usually goes against what everyone in the org would recommend, but they do it anyways."
2152,- Fast pace and pivots can be challenging to navigate - Poor work/life balance
2169,"""Diversity"" - There's a good lip service but, the reality is that upper management is mostly white. Until there is massive change in how recruiting and cultivating talent happens in the tech industry white guys are going to begat more white guys. Chances are pretty good they don't have friends or connections who are POC. This also holds true from people who come from other tech companies. When rats jump the ship they tend to bring other rats with them. Not so subtle hints that you have to hold a ""right"" set of beliefs/values - you have to get onboard or made to feel like an outsider. If you question or don't hold a certain The idea that Salesforce can save the human race - Salesforce is an innovative tech company with products and services that help customers do business. Be that! While SF is the biggest and holds a huge marketshare, it has created this idea that it can somehow save the world. Surrounded by lots of people who don't actually work with you - there are some teams that have a larger representation in certain hubs but, if you have a team that is largely based in one hub it can get lonely being surrounded by people who are largely irrelevant to your daily work life. It can also infringe on W/L balance. Ohana seating - Gross. Everyone needs their own desk and space. ""Data Driven"" - Sometimes translates to manipulating for personal gain and benefit."

2415,Achieving work-life balance is difficult under the pace the company is moving.
2426,"First, it's NOT a startup, and while the company seems to have a great future ahead, it's not a fast-growth place where you're going to get catered meals, massages, and toys to play with every day. This shouldn't be a problem, but since the HQ is in San Francisco, people are reminded of all the perks and opportunities that abound just around the corner (or in Silicon Valley). Also, while the company is a great place to work, it tends to favor extraverts and people who desire to move up or who want to do lots of things outside their current job role. Being surrounded by ""movers"" like this can be exhausting if you're one who wants to be ""comfortable"" and seeks to achieve work-life balance."
2459,Your success in sales is highly dependent on your patch(account base) which is hard to predict coming in the front door. The intensity of the company is great but the work/life balance if off as the demands of the job creep into all aspects of your life. Sales quotas go up every year and territories decrease which can be hard to keep up with. The product offering is getting more and more complicated and hard to keep up with. Management changes all the time as I had four managers in a span of 18 months. Their product offering while extensive does not do well in certain verticals so make sure your accounts are in those good verticals. The core CRM product is too complicated and not intuitive as they make it seem.
2460,"After 3 years you will be burned out and no further ahead in your career. If you find you are not burned out, congratulations! You are among the super-humans who can handle working 60 hours a week, playing politics, and working in a whirlwind environment. You know who you are - you run triathalons and scale mountains! If, however, you wish to have a balance in life, after 3 years you will start to look elsewhere for your next career move. Having Salesforce.com on your resume will open many doors for you, so you can take your career in any direction - start-up, mid-sized company, start out on your own, large company - you name it! So go ahead, take that job at Salesforce.com, just know it's a step in the right direction toward where you really want to be!"

2569,"Could be difficult to maintain healthy work-life balance, and salary rate is lower than average offer on the market for the same roles."
2586,"I hear that politics and such exist at the higher levels, but that's fortunately not visible much at the individual contributor level. If you have a good manager, you don't hear of such things, and you get to just focus on your work and career. So perhaps this is really a 'pro' than a 'con.' Priorities can and do shift regularly. It's really a part of the nature of software development. Top-down changes of directions can and do occur, though most have been huge successes. If you want a place where you go off into a corner and code on one thing for months or years, then Salesforce.com is not the place for you. Everything is collaborative, and you must be able to work well in a team. If you don't, then you'll hopefully learn quickly :-). Work-life balance can be difficult to achieve if you are eager to help everyone who comes your way with questions. It's really a matter of self-discipline to achieve a work-life balance, and it's almost all within your control."
2587,"-Work/life balance can be a challenge here, the company is very nimble (upper management) but do not consider downstream affects and operationally, can be very difficult to accommodate -Upper management usually does not care if you need to move mountains to accommodate their needs -Depending on your team, there is really little collaboration and teamwork, feels like every man for himself -The company focuses a lot on the sales org but very little on internal operations or internal groups which makes it hard to feel motivated to work here -This is the first job that i've ever had that I feel like I NEED to work during my vacations"
2603,Growing pains with a fast paced environment. Leadership is working to provide better work life balance however no near term end in sight.
2620,"Slightly unorganized, cross-department communication challenges, hard work-life balance, promotions constantly being given to upper management. Work-life balance can be very hard--not sure if this is the place for someone who only wants to work 8-5, especially within Product and Services. Although they say you're only expected to work 40-hour weeks, the reality is that everyone will be working 45-60, sometimes more during certain times of the year."
2672,"My team was relatively small, so work-life balance became challenging to manage at times."
2823,"Work life balance, work from home policy"
2874,"- The biggest shock to me: how bad lower-level management is. Idk where these people came from but they are micromanaging, unrealistic, unhelpful, insulting...like the list really goes on. Maybe my expectations were too high coming to this amazing company but there needs to be more training for leaders. - Promotion process is terrible, you're expected to ""network"" to find any answers to anything and it ends up being a huge waste of time more often than not. And don't even think about leaving the sales org. Managers don't help and People across the company look down on BDRs. Also, the pay compared to other places is not good at all. $50K base in seat and after you promote to the next step. OTE increases in next role but not base salary no matter what you promo into. - High metrics, low commission - Like any other sales role, you are made to feel as though you are only as good as your numbers - The metrics are INSANE. Everyone knows people are just BS'ing their way through bc the metrics are so unrealistic - Work-life balance is horrible if you're actually trying to do your job the legit way and its high stress all the time despite whatever is going on in the world - Snobby AEs that are selfish but no one cares if you're hitting your number"
2885,"- Depending on your role, your manager might not support the VTO during work hours - Depending on your role, you might not have any male salaries to compare against - The company and larger industry is still male-dominated, and you will still come up against entrenched sexism, this isn't utopia - ""Drinking from the fire hydrant"" is the work load. You either step up or leave during probation. If you do step up, you will reach your limit, then be overloaded again. If you're a workaholic and can balance that in a healthy way, great, but SFDC plays lip service to work-life balance in many departments.

Generally speaking, people are very passionate which is great, but can lead to conflict if there are competing interests. This can be uncomfortable, but is something you have to get used to. Upper management is 50/50 on saying the right thing vs saying something completely tone deaf (though admittedly, this ratio is still much better than most places). Work life balance is often talked about and encouraged, but when push comes to shove, the work has to get done, and sometimes you’re left holding the short end of that stick."
4389,"I came into Salesforce like every rep, excited and eager to get my “MBA” in sales. Working here you’ll have to be prepared to give up everything just to stay afloat. In the first year you will most likely be given a terrible territory and what you do with it will decide your future here. Things you will need to juggle effortlessly or will lead you down the road of being let go are: - Activity- lots of calls. People who fib numbers here are celebrated by leadership but frowned upon by reps - Opp rigor- the amount of fields you will need to update are mind numbing - Pipeline- with a terrible territory be prepared to pipe aspirational pipeline that will be highly scrutinized - Prep meetings- there are endless prep meetings before calls. Due to schedules each person involved will require a prep meeting, leaving your day with little time for anything else. - Team selling- be prepared to sell with folks much junior than you and not held to as high of standards. If the deal falls through, it’s on you. There are a few coprimes that are skilled sales reps - Your “brand”- It’s important to maintain appearances, even on bad days. Your brand is determined by how involved you are in diversity, volunteer work, and leading the team, which requires tenure. -Manager 1:1’s- these are a trap to look out for. Salesforce preaches trust as one of it pillars, but beware that everything said in those meetings will be used against you when they have soured on you - Time management- working a 12 hr day is table stakes. There are endless distractions you will need to navigate and make hard decisions on “brand”/ appearance maintenance vs selling The work/life balance is very heavy on the work side. The exec team repeatedly say their biggest regrets are not spending enough time with family. This will never change if they don’t take it serious. There is a lot you can learn here but at the expense of your self confidence as some managers make you feel worthless when your awful territory isn’t performing. If that isn’t enough to make you steer clear, the pay is very low and less than 20% of reps hit their annual numbers The “Ohana” culture is a mirage. There is nothing remotely familial about the culture. It is an ultra competitive pressure cooker. I just had such higher hopes for my experience left disappointed..."

4749,"I joined a smaller company Salesforce owned that was eventually swallowed whole by the larger Salesforce company, and we were fully integrated into one of the major clouds. Things were very pleasant and work was interesting before the roll over into Salesforce. However, once my team joined the larger company, is when things took a turn unfortunately. I believe things took a turn because Salesforce is built on top down management. The bigger the title the bigger the voice you’ll have. People use their title as weight when making decisions. The overall design culture is perceived as a second thought to a lot of teams. Due in part that your engineers can and will make decisions for you based on seniority. Not all, but most teams have a hard time getting their engineers to innovate and work with them. This behavior also comes from the previously mentioned work life balance. Anything that looks like it may take an extra hour, will fall off your design quickly. Be carful of Kool-aid drinking. They use the term “Ohana”, family in Hawaiian culture (which is also cultural appropriation) to describe their own internal company culture. The management team uses this type of thinking to determine if your a team player or not. The type of “family” culture they perpetuate creates a lot of passive aggressive behavior. Add the behavioral issues onto the top down management, and you have a recipe for ladder climbing, favoritism, yes men, and brown nosing. The executive running the design on my cloud showed incredible bias and fueled this behavior. As well as some very questionable hiring and promotional practices. I felt their behavior was highly unethical, and they felt no remorse for their actions. The product you build at Salesforce will only ship 3 times a year. That’s if it ships at all. The pace is incredibly slow moving. I can not stress that enough. Changing an icon can literally take 9 months. This can make it hard to retain the talent that comes from a start up environment. Which Salesforce is in desperate need of. The salary is adequate at best for most designers. I found out later that I actually made much more coming from a different company and rolling into Salesforce. RSU’s are some of the lowest you’ll be awarded in the tech industry for a company this size. Most director level people get any meaningful stock refresher. Like I mentioned, top down management. I negotiated cash over RSU’s (which made my offer compelling). While a lot of what I wrote can seems very negative, not everyone I had the chance to work with made me feel this way. I did have the opportunity to meet “some” talented designers and engineers. I had the opportunity to volunteer and help others. The work I was doing at the time had impact up to certain point and I did learn a thing or two while at Salesforce. TL;DR: Top down management creates passive aggressive behavior. Slow moving development time, Salesforce only ships 3 times a year. Design is a second thought for most teams (but not all). Base salary is average, not competitive. RSU’s for a company this size are some of the worst in the industry."
4758,"They title people as Field Account Executive however they do not truly operate this way.

5088,"A few months ago, there was a large surge of hiring. Most of the hires came from a third party vendor that was closing. Some of the new hires from this location were previously denied applicants. I discovered that these new employees were being hired in Senior positions over me, making more money than me, and were even given relocation bonuses that I was told I could not have when I relocated in the previous year to work for this company. When I was first hired, the interview process seemed incredibly difficult to get through. Once they had seats to fill, it became a mad dash to find anyone with any Salesforce experience to fill the seats, and they seemed to do anything to get those people here. I am now left feeling worthless and insignificant in my surroundings. My experience, hard work, and dedication to this company is now meshed into a field of call center employees dashing to meet metrics. On top of the new employees that were hired from this vendor, they also hired managers. I know that people take time to adjust, but these managers are killing our vibe. Salesforce prides itself on transparency. These managers keep secrets and treat employees like worker bees. We have had multiple interactions with upper management where they will talk about a big change, and act surprised when they find out that those of us at the bottom didn't know about the change. The new managers don't understand the need for work and life balance. We previously had options to work remotely when we were ill, or even having an off day. Where we were didn't matter as long as we were doing our jobs. Now, if you are sick and want to work from home, you are asked to take PTO (since you are not given Sick time, you need to use your vacation time)more often, which encourages sick people to come to work and spread their illness throughout the building. Talent seems to mean nothing here as well. It's all about how many years of service. I know of employees who don't put in the effort , who barely get their work done, and they are promoted because of how long they've been here, while I train other employees, mentor, and do still meet metrics, and I'm stuck at the same level. You report to a manager here, but good luck finding your manager if you need something. The Managers are presented as people managers, but when it really comes down to it, they are project managers. I end up doing many small tasks for my manager, that my manager doesn't have time to do, in order to keep my team running smoothly. By no means do I blame my manager for this, but they need to take some of this off their plates. They seem to work 24 hours a day. We recently had a huge push to get our case load down to a specific number. Our portion of the Organization spent 10 weeks squeezing every last drop out of every single one of us to close as many cases as possible. The communication that was sent out read as ""I know you are working hard and thank you for your efforts, but work harder"". After week 8, everyone around me was miserable. There were daily meltdowns from ""Analysts"" who were mad at customers for needing help, when the real problem was the amount of work they expected us to do, and the free time outside of work they expected us to sacrifice. Of course, management didn't see these meltdowns because they were off running Reports on metrics and trying to over analyze the reason behind xyz. When I first came here, I really thought that this was a career. It now feels now different than any call center or retail job I have worked in. This is the longest I've ever worked at a company without receiving a promotion."

5169,Too much annoying bureaucracy. Your tenure at the company dictates how valuable your ideas are instead of its merit. Huge technical debt and age old technical stack. Code takes few hours to compile and is terrible. Most of the developers are fresh grads or been with the company for an extensive period of time. Engineering executives are non-technical but have been with the company for a long time. Lot of QA folks have been promoted to Director and Sr. Directors as they did a good job buttering up the executives. Too much title inflation in Product and Engineering. Hectic work life balance in San Francisco HQ. Change in Direction of the Product and Reorgs happen almost every few weeks. Mediocre developers keep on changing groups in the Open Opportunity Market and still survive.

The result of this is that you will constantly be struggling to achieve a balanced work/life ratio. Salesforce.com is fun, and it can be fun to get completely involved, and to immerse yourself in your work. However, you will find that working nights and weekends is pretty much a requirement to keep up with the pace, management expectations, and your coworkers.

6232,"Salesforce boasts a great exterior perception, but the real deal is less than glamorous. The sad thing is once you’re hired, if you do want to go elsewhere, other employers wonder what’s wrong with you because of the positive perception Salesforce has. I’ve listed several reasons why I have not recommended Salesforce to my network below. Corporate monster: The company tries to stifle employee concerns with surface-level actions like weekly team-lead meetings regarding employee worries, but nothing changes. All that happens is generic and blanket corporate messages funneled back to concerned employees. It takes years to adjust concerns about quota (ie: why is my Oklahoma quota the same as a Bay Area quota? Which, by the way, is still not resolved). Non-promotions: The company touts “rapid promotion” within the sales path, but the honest truth is that the first three to five years (ie: SR, EBR, and ESB AE) are just doormat positions with little additional salary that take longer than promised to get through. Resentment: Additionally, it is a widely known fact internally that the company hires overqualified individuals at a lower level title than they deserve. This creates a consistent stream of resentment throughout the organization. General work/life balance: For SRs (Sales Reps), our stack ranking is a joke. It leads people to act so immorally and just creates more junk for other people to deal with and waste time on. Since we are stack ranked, everyone is afraid to take a vacation since that means their numbers will be behind others that take no vacation. The department tried to alter the policy saying that reps that take at least 4 days off PTO will not have to worry about that month effecting their promotion, but does not adjust their actual quota for the month (meaning your paycheck still suffers). Lovely. Go to Box or Netsuite, or another great startup-like company that will value you. I’ve recommended other companies over the one I’m currently working for time and again. That alone should speak volumes."

If you want space, you have to set it and hold to it. - Less than 30% of reps hit their quota and making money is more about lucky timing with SPIFFs than it is skill."

6485,"The ""culture"" at Salesforce is extremely toxic. Everything that they do is purely lip service. Their work life balance? There is none. Diversity, do they make diverse hires? Sure, are you welcome into the office? No. How do they keep getting such great reviews? Take a look at the reviews, most of them are from employees that are 6 months or less. Right after you attend training(which is great) you are sent a survey to rate them on Glassdoor. You are on a high from training and have no idea what you have gotten yourself into yet so you give them 5 stars. Fast forward if you are an AE you are given your territory that has generated virtually no revenue from the year before or was oversold by the previous rep(you are then stuck with handling customer service issues due to poor implementation) and a number that is impossible to reach. Multiple times a week you are required to have a 1:1 with your manager to go over this territory where you are trying to make lemons into lemonade. Nepotism and favoritism runs rampant here. They allow other employees who have ""put in the work"" aka been there the longest to get the best territories and therefore they are hitting their number and eligible for promotions. The irony of this is that they are also tasked with training new employees where they have the attitude of "" pull yourself up by your bootstraps"". They are little to virtually no help because Salesforce fosters an environment where you personally have to be #1. Anything or anybody that could interfere with that is seen as a threat. I could go on about how terrible of an experience this was for me and I also recognize that this isn't everybody's experience as well. However I would be lying if I didn't cringe every time I see articles talking about their next initiative."

6723,"work/life balance depending of your role, internal communication"
6727,"- work/personal life balance: you need to be always on, even during vacation/outside of regular business hours - multiple acquisitions of other companies often requires modifying internal processes and structure (every fiscal year org structure seems to change - this may be a good or bad thing depending on your point of view)"
6732,High pressure no work life balance
6755,"It can be a very competitive environment, not necessarily in a positive way. Naturally, as the company grows it becomes less able to hold onto the small-startup culture that it once had. If you fit in, you fit in well but if not it can be a lonely place to be. Work-life balance is very much a work-in-progress."
6830,"While Salesforce touts its 'Ohana', being in a company that size means that you do feel like a number sometimes rather than a person. Can be a very intense place to work. While they do promote work-life balance, the amount of work you have on your plate means that you're working long hours and weekends a lot of the time."

6968,"targets it is impossible to have good work/life balance overwhelming office - open desk policy is nice, but there is lack of desks"

7033,"Performance objectives, work/life balance, information overload"
7050,"Salary increases and promotions are restricted to the 'boys club'. The Ohana culture is well touted internally and externally, but the reality is that the focus is purely on growth and sales with little concern for employees ZERO work/life balance, I've now heard that we should be considering work/life integration instead! Sales people count has grown exponentially, however the sales support functions have not, therefore there is a very limited pool of support resources. Expect 12-16 hour days if in sales. Be ready to drink from a fire hose when it comes to information overload No real structure Becoming a 'revolving door' company with account executives"
7062,"1. Horrible management and lack of leadership and responsibility 2. Salesforce Hyd R&D does not hold the title well since most of the work is service based. 3. The R&D management does not offer growth, leaders of this group are very impatient and rude. Not worth being in good books. No respect given to peer’s and sub-ordinates, R&D management is only concerned about its own position and growth. 4. The management in Hyd office will claim that Salesforce among the best companies to work for - this is true but only applies to the US head office, certainly does not apply to Hyd office. 5. Don't be surprised that young employees working in this company for quiet some time can be political and very influential. 6. The maturity in most employees is below par. They have only one thought in mind, how to grow and get more money no matter if they have to step over there own colleague. 7. Work life balance is bad in some teams. Expectation is you will have to slog and meet the deadlines. If you don't then you need to look elsewhere. 8. Salesforce Hyd has always been on the HQ's radar in terms of quality of work and deliveries. Unfortunately the situation is not good. 9. Quality of work is ridiculously below par. People don't care if the code is messed up, all that is important is releasing the product with the proposed feature. 10. In some teams, employees argue and embarrass each other with respect to deliveries. They don’t care about one’s self respect, no respect for other colleague, finger pointing is a very common phenomenon. 11. Feedback sickness - management will constantly take feedback from diff employees working in your team, if anyone gives wrong feedback; that will not be communicated back to you, instead it will be used against u. 12. Employees in most teams are impatient and hungry for growth. Verdict – Employees in this company have low self-respect and self-esteem."
7074,1) Mangers openly show disregard for culture and operate independently with limited checks. They have openly disregarded VTO activity as a waste of time. 2) They have too much control in hiring and with no systems in place will hire people they know and be discriminatory towards people who might be more talented. 3)There is not scope of work-life balance for employees in this particular team in T&P. Manager outrightly denies any request to work from home and expects all employees to be caged at their workplace

7199,"- Depending on your role, your manager might not support the VTO during work hours - Depending on your role, you might not have any male salaries to compare against - The company and larger industry is still male-dominated, and you will still come up against entrenched sexism, this isn't utopia - ""Drinking from the fire hydrant"" is the work load. You either step up or leave during probation. If you do step up, you will reach your limit, then be overloaded again. If you're a workaholic and can balance that in a healthy way, great, but SFDC plays lip service to work-life balance in many departments. The work-life balance is often achieved through working from home while your family is asleep. - 99% of opportunities outside of the USA are sales-focussed"

I joined couple of months back with very high hopes and tons of excitement but resigned without completing a year because of their work culture, rude & arrogant managers, no work-life balance, micro-management, no process in work, and many more. They don't follow the Salesforce standard. Before you join this team ask people over LinkedIn already in this team. Once you join your life will be hell for sure"
7250,Sometimes work-life balance is not idea
7254,"Do not join Salesforce Industries(Vlocity Team) unless you want to ruin your life and career. They are just lucky that they got acquired by Salesforce and now on the name of Salesforce people like us join and get stuck. Their management is very immature and will have expectations from you like working over weekend, working late nights, completing dev works of 3 weeks in 3 days. This team is just like a start-up company. Management is very rude and arrogant. No Work-life balance, Micro Management. This team wont let you change team internally. No career opportunities. No Culture. No Diversity."

7472,"Heavy workload for some departments, however company is promoting work-life balance"
7517,"Favoritism. Political. Get in with the inner circle (decision makers) and you're golden. Salesforce talks a lot about Ohana, even setting their top method/ measure as ohana - but as many other reviewers mentioned. It's all smoke and mirrors. The culture is cut throat and people help you if they think you can help them in the future. There's no sense of boundaries or work life balance. Managers and stake holders text you nights and weekends asking for something ASAP. Managers manage up here and if your work isn't 100% what they need they question your intelligence. They don't want to mentor or manage, they want robots ready to push out work."
7518,Tough work life balance to maintain
7543,"There's zero work/life balance if you're in Services. You are expected to be ""on call"" all hours of the evening, work long hours during the day/week, and forget having any extracurricular activities or spending time with your family. You cannot ""check out"" and it's not a healthy lifestyle. Don't challenge senior leadership on department practices, ways to foster change, or steer from the majority opinion because you will pay for it in performance reviews even though they state in your interview that they love new ideas that change the way they operate. When you add up the hours you actually work during the week, you are significantly underpaid!"
7548,"Boiler room mentality, customer success is more of marketing-Customers are harassed constantly to keep up with monthly close and cadence.No long term strategy in enterprise accounts and customers are getting fatigued by this behaviour-Micro managment who only care about monthly ACV in Strategic accounts -High turnover in upper end of strategic sales.-Terrible mid level management who manage based on fear over mid 40s experienced sales team for Carolinas and Atlanta-No work life balance"
7554,"- Work life balance is terrible - They took the alcohol away because they hire alcoholics - Everything is a snowflake and not scalable (they will eventually figure this out and it will hurt when it matters) - Incompetent management (mid and senior level - how are these people getting hired/promoted?) - Too much management so nothing actually gets done - CAB/change management is incompetent - Dev does not seem to know how to make their products stable or supportable - Infrastructure does not seem to know how to make their environments stable - Meetings (let's have a meeting about a meeting and we will schedule a meeting to discuss the meeting) - Internal Salesforce recruiting/hiring is worthless - Indy Tower move provides no benefit to employees and worsens work life balance - Commute worse now since the move to the ivory tower - Pay for your own parking (penalized for not living in the city) - No real room for growth within Marketing Cloud for SREs - Worst career decision I have made from a skill set perspective (no marketable skill set growth outside of the company) - Company liberal agenda constantly shoved down your throat - Employees placed into a silo - Mandatory holiday work for Marketing Cloud so other companies can send more spam to people who do not want it - SRE team mandatory weekly on call rotation recently went from 4 weeks/year to 15 weeks/year (yes, seriously, and that is the main reason I quit Salesforce for a real #dreamjob elsewhere) - The company itself provides no real benefit to society so they allow employees to volunteer to feel fulfilled on the inside but really it is thinly veiled attempt at marketing and promotion of the company - Stressful workplace - Job titles are made up - Open office concept is detrimental to productivity and health in general - Cult feeling with all the internal lingo - Ridiculous amount of money spent on unnecessary things but then they take away the small amount of money they contributed to parking costs which is a necessity - Giant corporation now... culture cannot keep up with acquisitions. News flash: people are different in different parts of the country and the rest of the world. Company needs to just admit they are the same as other giant corporations. - No longer feels like a innovative/entrepreneurial/start-up company (Now we just buy those kinds of companies, even if it doesn't make sense. I'm looking at you Quip.) - The company has never told a customer no, even when they needed to do so and the company is feeling it - Company seems to reward bad client behavior instead of correcting it - I am tired of typing but there are definitely more cons than pros"
7563,"Management is full of hyprocrisy. Salesforce's core values include things like transparency and equality, both of which have been completely ignored on our team (and apparently also on other teams after reading other reviews here). There is a complete lack of communication from the top down, which makes our team unable to perform our work well. Furthermore, there is little feedback on how we can get promotions or raises. There is a culture of not giving feedback and you need to ""read between the lines"" in order to know what feedback there is (this is what was told to me by management). On our team, promotions are given to the men more often than the women, and men with the same title and less experience as women have higher salaries. Also, the skill of managing people isn't seen as part of the requirements of being a people manager. A lot of people who are great individual contributors get promoted to Manager and aren't very good at their new job of dealing with their direct reports, but upper management doesn't care. Work life balance is also not very flexible during busy season (which lasts from October through March)."
7564,"Cutthroat sales floor, high visibility, no work-life balance, monthly quotas stressful, sell in Salesforce Way, very political"
7566,"The Ohana culture is wonderful but unfortunately it's not practiced by many leaders. They don't reward good leadership and embodying the culture. I had heard it was the influx of the Oracle culture - and the sad part is we talked a lot about how important the culture was but we didn't hold senior leadership for it...so there was a lot of bad behavior (yelling, bullying, not allowing work/life balance, etc) . Felt a lot like it was all for PR and branding but not really what was valued or practiced. There also is a lot of breaking points due to scaling growth - systems and technology in many functions are a joke. Many groups have had to create very manual processes b/c the systems are unreliable or not kept up to standard to scale."
7603,"Disconnects between product management and engineering that are impactful to delivery speed and quality, 24/7 international business (pro and con) which makes work/life balance something that must be very well looked after."
7673,"work/ life balance, becoming more corporate, smaller tasks are getting assigned, does not offer full meals ( lunches) rather than small snacks"
7719,"- Management can be awful and unregulated. Discrimination occurs and they say it wasn’t intentional so it’s okay - Keep your head down and mouth shut. Aim to fly under the radar, and stay middle of the pack. If you over perform you may be punished just as much if not worse than if you under perform - overworked and underpaid. Do not expect work life balance. - Claim they pay hourly including overtime, but management often caps hour submission at a certain level. Therefore, don’t expect to get paid for all the hours you actually work. - don’t anticipate management to help or coach you - culture seems very dependent on your location, rely on culture reviews accordingly. - Big push for monthly quotas, yet told by tenure employees almost 60% of business done in the last quarter. Set expectations wisely."
7720,"Executive leadeship has a vision and stated values that don't necessarily trickle down to the rank and file. Favoritism, backstabbing, biases, and politicking typical of any large corporation in rampant. If you're lucky, you'll have a good manager or be your manager's favorite. If that is the case, you might be very happy here. Work-life balance doesn't exist and there are constant changes of direction. My best advice: Don't let it take over your life with happy hours and ""ohana"" talk. Work SMART, learn everything you can, network, build your brand, watch your back, and get out at the 3 year mark."
7761,"No work life balance Capped on hours you can log Constantly told you can't travel during business hours but also cannot log those hours traveling (illegal?) Management will mock you for giving feedback even if they say it's ""anonymous"" No negotiation power Highly underpaid when comparing to the competition Entire sales team is under quota over 50% of the months"
7783,Need to improve work/life balance
7797,"- The Kool-Aid. You must LOVE the product, LOVE your team, LOVE your managers, LOVE the process. Oh, and you better LOVE going to happy hours, clubs and team outings with your coworkers. - Because of the terrible work/life balance, brown-nosing to get ahead is very very prevalent. There's a huge amount of gossip and ""buy in"" that's required. It's not a workplace for individuals, it's a workplace for THEIR individual."
7810,There are so many challenging projects to work on that it's sometimes hard to say no so you can find some work-life balance. High expectations to respond instantly even off hours.

7883,A lot of work and not as much of a life/work balance.
7909,"-long hours, not much work life balance -big initial learning curve"
7911,Organization is getting larger and more bureaucratic making it harder to get things done; career path isn't well defined; work/life balance
7928,"Main cons are that it's a huge corporation and things get done sloowwwwly compared to startups and smaller companies. No matter what your role, it seems there's someone else doing the exact same thing in a different part of the company who is completely siloed from you, and it all gets very confusing. Projects take a long time to complete because a million people need to approve. Many people just don't reply to emails or show up to meetings because they're ""too busy."" Still, I think it's a 4-star workplace because you can easily do good work and get paid well without stressing yourself out too much. My work-life balance is pretty good here compared to smaller companies that are more stressful, so in that sense it's a win."
7963,"Teams are very siloed. Head's down work environment. A lot of people do not participate in work events because they're too busy. If you're in services department, you won't have the best work/life balance"
8097,"I mean...it's hard to know where to start but I'll try to do my best. First, a lot of people talk about career and promotions - and how there's little to know transparency about the process, nepotism is rampant and the like. The company knows this, which is why ES has done away with giving performance reviews. Now, instead of being clear on what exactly you need to do to move up the chain, they're putting this on you. The result is that many people get promoted solely for political/favoritism , and people who actually have technical skills can get lost if there is no one mentoring them on how to play the game. And as other people have mentioned, employees do get rated by their managers every year, but they never see the results of their evaluation. The typical ES response to this will be ""Salesforce is not for everyone"" - but this should not take the place of transparency around the promotion process, especially in a company that touts itself on being transparent in every other way. The whole situation is a really messed up way of dealing with the fact that there are too many talented and driven people here. Work life balance, especially in regional roles, is nonexistent. During a regional rotation, I was actually paid less than my San Francisco salary per our mobility policies, but I was expected to lead projects in San Francisco AND the regional location. The result was 15-18 hour days, 6 days per week. Even though I discussed the concerns I had with my manager, their response was the typical ""Maybe Salesforce just isn't for you."" The situation did finally get better after I sought legal advice, and realized that this type of working structure was actually illegal per the local environment. However, it was clear that the escalation was seen as politically incorrect, and the regional rotation quickly became a dead end with no career growth or development. I was lucky enough to find a team in San Francisco that was willing to take me as a way out, but I share this as a cautionary tale for anyone considering taking on a similar role. Make sure you have a good local attorney, as many teams at Salesforce are predatory, and see the rotational experience as a way to get you to take on more for less money - they will retaliate against you if you try to escalate concerns about your work environment (and on the other side, try getting anyone in San Francisco to take a call before 8am or after 5pm, and people will act like you're crazy - it's a complete double standard). Salesforce is going to start offering more and more roles like this outside of San Francisco to reduce costs, so be sure you know what you're getting yourself into and how you'll be supported if you take one of these on. Operations are a complete mess with many groups doing the same thing, each one trying to assert themselves. Ever since I've been here, there seems to be a focus on wellness, though this gets rebranded time and again as different initiatives. The end result is that people are super driven from 8-5, but cut corners so they can make it to that 5:30pm yoga class. I'm not saying people should work 24/7, but this is an example of how Salesforce and its culture often embody mixed messages (grow grow grow but make sure you have a balance). The result is a lot of groups who say ""This isn't my problem/I'm not owning it/Find someone else to talk to."" In a matrixed environment, this becomes really frustrating - especially as the company has gotten so much bigger. Ultimately, the Company is becoming larger and more bureaucratic - many employees are not receiving raises this year because the company wants to focus on bottom line growth at the expense of its people. At some point over the last 10 years, my day became 100% focused on managing the politics as opposed to creating value and focusing on work I enjoy. Because of this, I've decided to leave Salesforce after a long ride. It's bittersweet, but kind of like that song - ""You don't have to go home, but you can't stay here""; the writing is on the wall in terms of where this company is going - the culture has is getting more and more eroded with the growth. As a final word of warning, I will just encourage all potential candidates to take Salesforce marketing with a grain of salt. Salesforce is one of the only companies I know of that has an internal marketing team who is tasked with trying to tell you how you should feel about the company. Yes, it's true - they have done a lot of great things, but usually the motivation behind it is much more about showing how this initiative is part of the Salesforce brand, as opposed to genuinely providing assistance to someone or some organization that needs help."

Below are a few of the cons I find most frustrating. - Micro Management on an extreme scale. I joined just before the pandemic and it has gotten continually worse since being forced to work from home. You don't feel trusted. - Unrealistic workloads. - Encouraged to manage your work life balance but chastised if you actually do it. I've been scolded for having my car serviced at 2pm, or taking annual leave at a quarter cut off to celebrate a birthday. - Meetings for meetings sake burning precious time. - Saturated account sets. Prospects get bombarded continually from all angles of Salesforce and have been for over a decade. - Lead generation is down to you. You have to be BDR, AE and even SE on some opportunities, unless you're in the enterprise/strategic accounts. I have not had more than 3 leads passed to me in almost 18 months. - Always an ""urgent"" action that needs to be taken. Often which is not directly impacting your ability to engage with clients."

8458,a lot of focus on high-performers only work life balance is what you make it...
8467,Local leadership is so focused on female diversity outcomes that talented internal and external candidates that don’t fit that profile are overlooked. Very “stepford wives” without any people of colour in senior roles within the CEO’s direct business (at least that was the case last year). Lots of people politic to get promoted - straight talkers and doers are often side lined vs “brand” individuals. Targets have become unrealistic and territories are carved so thin that by staying you are effectively giving yourself a pay cut each year. The culture has become bloated with self importance. Nothing humble about the way it’s presented. Over focus on certification and pointless training. Seems to keep an army busy while the workers barely get time to see customers anymore. Work/life balance depends on your role. Plenty of people seem to have lots of time to be volunteering or involved in non-revenue generating activities while other people are smashed.

Allowed to take days off only in August and February. In some teams like mine you can’t even work from home. -You have to travel abroad 3/4 times per month and they want you to take flights at dawn or at night cause “you can’t lose working hours”. -One of the best values is volunteering - guess what? Underestimated and not taken for real in my team. -Managers only care about numbers, you are not a person at all. -People underestimate people working in other companies cause they feel they are the best but they are so poor and sad inside. -If people leave cause they feel bad, the other “teammates” and managers will make fun of them. -Micromanagement: your manager will expect to be cc’d in every single email you send to your customers."
