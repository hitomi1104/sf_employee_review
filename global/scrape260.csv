For everything you notate in Salesforce and Quip be prepared to discuss with 3 levels of management on all the details several times a month in a nonproductive meeting. We don't use Salesforce the way we sell companies on using Salesforce and it shows in our meetings that could have been a Slack update. Did I mention overbooked calendar?

You will receive no support, will be constantly bullied by people who think they are the smartest in the room but have no idea how the companies they sell into actually work. Their only advice is “be strategic”, but leadership has no clue on what that even means. The group is run by politics.

At the lower levels, this isn't bad, but I see what my managers and higher-ranked people on the team deal with. Especially with COVID, lots of meetings and that limits productivity. A little too ""woke"", even as a liberal (ie we're distancing ourselves from our Hawaiian/Ohana culture because it's ""cultural appropriation"") - I think conservatives have to keep that mostly under wraps (common in big tech) I've heard (haven't experienced) that promotions are somewhat political and very opaque.",4 people found this review helpful

Collaboration was not easy because teams were territorial and defensive. Felt like people were always watching their backs or backstabbing to get ahead (and this area in particular always scores low on the internal employee surveys). No visibility on how performance is measured and how promotions are decided. Find myself in meetings where everyone’s saying the same thing just for the sake of saying something and getting visibility. And these are the people who are rewarded. Marc Benioff is out of touch. When you keep harping on about “Ohana” but then layoff thousands of employees during a global pandemic when you’ve been reporting major YoY growth, it shows your true colors. I get it, it’s a business. But don’t pretend otherwise. It’s so fake. All this is to say that Salesforce has a very very very strong sales culture and it reflects in its employees. If you can drink the cool aid and go with it, great. But if you value authentic colleagues who genuinely value team work, trust, and collaboration - it’s going to be tough to find here.",4 people found this review helpful

Just like any other company they are in the business of making money and will dump any loyal employee if there is a way to increase the stock price. Watch out after any new company acquisition as the billions invested in the purchase will need to be compensated with laying off thousands of loyal employees in any region (not just USA) even when there are billions of cash in the bank. Laid off victims were given a couple of months to"" find a new position/role"" within the company except to my knowledge NOBODY I know got that coveted new position, I'm sure someone did but how many out of thousands of laid off employees... probably 1%, 3%? Oh yes, there was a high percentage of over 40-45yr old laid off employees as we all know younger employees cost less. So a lot of talk about diversity but in practice it seems there are just some categories that are considered for a diverse work force, older employees are not one of them. After you get laid off HR will become very unresponsive, YMMV. Promotion process was black magic at least to people within my unit.",16 people found this review helpful

What doesn’t Salesforce with its mega growth? 401k match is nice but lower than the average. Good boys club still exists. Females are treated differently.

Yes, the pandemic has changed the way we do everything but honestly 95% of the company worked 90% remote before the pandemic so what I'm currently experiencing cannot possibly be as a result of the pandemic. The culture used to be people oriented where you could bring your whole self to work. You could count on a face paced environment but very clearly direction on objectives. You could expect leadership to be focused and thoughtful in their plans and direction. No more. The company still pays lip service to ""Ohana"", equality, and our values. However we have increasingly promoted really good engineers into leadership roles -- senior leadership roles to boot -- who have little idea about what it takes to be an effective leader. The company is disorganized and entirely focused on delivering everything yesterday that there is no room to focus on ""Ohana"" and taking care of the people in the process. Marc no longer is an active, visible leader in the organization. That falls mainly to Brett Taylor who seems content on turning Salesforce into Google.

200,Smoke and Mirrors,"Feb 10, 2021 - Account Executive",1.0,The Salesforce platform is amazing and so is the training that they provide that is usually onsite in San Francisco.,"The ""culture"" at Salesforce is extremely toxic. Everything that they do is purely lip service. Their work life balance? There is none. Diversity, do they make diverse hires? Sure, are you welcome into the office? No. How do they keep getting such great reviews? Take a look at the reviews, most of them are from employees that are 6 months or less. Right after you attend training(which is great) you are sent a survey to rate them on Glassdoor. You are on a high from training and have no idea what you have gotten yourself into yet so you give them 5 stars. Fast forward if you are an AE you are given your territory that has generated virtually no revenue from the year before or was oversold by the previous rep(you are then stuck with handling customer service issues due to poor implementation) and a number that is impossible to reach. Multiple times a week you are required to have a 1:1 with your manager to go over this territory where you are trying to make lemons into lemonade. Nepotism and favoritism runs rampant here. They allow other employees who have ""put in the work"" aka been there the longest to get the best territories and therefore they are hitting their number and eligible for promotions. The irony of this is that they are also tasked with training new employees where they have the attitude of "" pull yourself up by your bootstraps"". They are little to virtually no help because Salesforce fosters an environment where you personally have to be #1. Anything or anybody that could interfere with that is seen as a threat. I could go on about how terrible of an experience this was for me and I also recognize that this isn't everybody's experience as well. However I would be lying if I didn't cringe every time I see articles talking about their next initiative.",27 people found this review helpful

270,"Great company, great culture, and a solid place to advance your career if you work hard and establish a strong brand.",,4.0,"- Company values and fun, collaborative culture - Competitive salary - Amazing benefits such as 401K match, ESPP program, commuter discounts, and more - Flexibility in terms of your schedule, location, and being able to step away when needed - The family or Ohana feel is real and permeates throughout the company - We know how to work hard and play hard, can we say Dreamforce! - Opportunities for upward mobility. As long as you work hard and do impactful work and establish a strong brand you can thrive here and carve out your own career path. - Amazing benefits and support for working parents e.g. 6.5 maternity leave, 3 month paternity leave, flexible return to work schedule, fertility benefits, etc.","- Can be bureaucratic at times being such a highly-matrixed organization - Although innovation is a core value, company size can interfere with ability to be super nimble and agile for certain departments at times (but this not unique to Salesforce, most large companies struggle with this) - Hard work is rewarded, but you also have to be diligent about establishing your brand and getting visibility with those who have power to help advance your career. So if you are not comfortable advocating for yourself and sometimes shouting your wins from the rooftop you may not want to work here. This is very true in Marketing, perhaps not all other BUs. - While diversity is a core a value, Salesforce like most tech companies are not as diverse as they think, so something to keep in mind if you're a minority. They are, however, making HUGE priorities around DEI initiatives particularly with recruiting efforts.",1 person found this review helpful

It is very obvious the leadership has liberal/democratic believes and so do many of the employees. I personally like to avoid discussing politics so I find it really uncomfortable. 2- It’s such a big organization that it takes a while to understand how it is structured and your career path options. 3- The Management layer seems to be there to check a box and doesn’t seem to really be trained or given the tools to train and develop their team.
