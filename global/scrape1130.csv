1,Drinking from the Fire Hydrant,,4.0,- Community involvement is high with 7 days (56hours) of VTO during business hours encouraged - Better culture for women than most tech companies - Commitment to equality and doing better (appreciating no one is perfect and entrenched bigotry/sexism/racism takes a long time to overturn) - Chief Equality Officer Tony Prophet - Regular salary comparisons to eliminate inequality in salaries based on gender - Australian private health insurance paid by the company - Flexible working arrangements in some teams so you can work remotely,"- Depending on your role, your manager might not support the VTO during work hours - Depending on your role, you might not have any male salaries to compare against - The company and larger industry is still male-dominated, and you will still come up against entrenched sexism, this isn't utopia - ""Drinking from the fire hydrant"" is the work load. You either step up or leave during probation. If you do step up, you will reach your limit, then be overloaded again. If you're a workaholic and can balance that in a healthy way, great, but SFDC plays lip service to work-life balance in many departments. The work-life balance is often achieved through working from home while your family is asleep. - 99% of opportunities outside of the USA are sales-focussed",2 people found this review helpful

One of the greatest perks of the job is the volunteering you can do for local charities. I have been lucky enough to work some charities and get to meet some genuinely amazing people, all within my working week.

It is a company that cares for her employees and her customers plus got very innovative solutions. The onboarding was amazing and the company does make you feel proud that you work there.","Equality: There is a good focus on equality which is good as it is needed. In my eyes there is a lack of female managers or managers that understand how to use the strengths of having woman in the sales team. Overall, all managers have a checkbox they need to complete by hiring or interviewing woman, I think in the end they will be better in also give specific trainings to managers on how to actually manage a woman better. Remote worker: The biggest downfall of SF. A remote worker means they expect you to be in the office on a weekly base, rather more than less. Being used to work with Lync or Skype, there is a lack of the internal technology (acceptance) to make remote workers more involved remote instead of face to face. Everyone is using google hangouts or GTM. Internal presentations and meetings in my eyes should be 80% of the time remote.",3 people found this review helpful

User interface is implemented with a proprietary framework (Aura) that is universally criticized by its users as inferior to Aspect and other industry standards, but is ferociously defended by company insiders. Similarly, storage is done via a proprietary layer atop a small number of massive Oracle databases. This means that one database outage affects a large number of customers. The Oracle centric mindset of the ""old boys"" has been incredibly resistant to change. Unit testing is slowly gaining acceptance, but is still by far the exception to the rule. The monolithic nature of the code base means that tests may take several days to catch regressions.

Example: you do 200% of your sales target and you're next in line for a promotion. Management will tap 3 people. You have now earned the right to interview for a promotion. You will be given a case study to present to senior directors. You will get beaten up in this meeting far beyond what any customer would put you through. At the end 1 of the 3 people will be selected to move up. The other 2 go back and wait until they are tapped again for a promotion.

The Ohana (broadly interpreted as family) culture is a real living culture, that imbues most people's behaviours. People help each other, and are not focused on trying to get one over on each other. The company is very much in growth mode, which makes for optimism and a sense of purpose.","The company is at something of a crossroads, wedded to some of the disadvantages of its start-up mentality: thinking can be short-term, with decisions accordingly myopic, and there is too great a value placed on the diving-catch. Too many fire-drills and a small number of capricious senior leaders who have been around for 10 - 15 years behaving in the same way. It is tiresome, disruptive and frankly counter-cultural but their tenure appears to make them untouchable.",5 people found this review helpful

Some people are stuck in monotonous work and see move to management their only way out and act in poor spirit. If you are looking for good work and team, don't bother. Join a startup instead.

Great onboarding Great office Good culture (mostly see cons) Good compensation Good leader in Mark B I really like Salesforce but with any company get a crap manager and your life becomes hell even if you are hitting the number. People leave mangers and not companies. Dreamforce is crazy but fun. I met some great people in the business. Growing like crazy. You can still cut a deal which was good. Good paid time off to do charity work. Good commission if you are in the right part of the business,As with many US based firms many of the mangers I had were based in the US. Most have zero idea on life in EMEA both business and culturally as they never got on a plane and been bothered to come here. This made them some of the most ignorant and useless people managers I have had the misfortune to work for and sadly nothing the UK management team could change or influence. If you join one of the companies which SFDC has taken over then good luck. It can take years for systems to join up and merged and this can lead to a huge duplication of effort and time. I did see some people make some good money here but lots running around chasing completely unattainable sales targets year after year. They seemed caught up in the hype rather than making money. Despite telling everyone that there are lots of career opportunities in the UK I did not see many at all. Again your career will be down to knowing the chosen three of four people within the business who can help you to get there. It seems like a long and tiresome process. Many of the management have come from the same background and company and this management style does show sadly. A few but not all where rude and unaaproachable despite constantly telling the company of their open door policy. Mark B is a charasmiatic leader and I wonder who would fill his large shoes once he departs.,4 people found this review helpful
