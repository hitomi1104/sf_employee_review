The company (who claims their value is trust) employs managers who speak about their employees behind their back. The manager would cancel all the meetings I scheduled for us witout saying a word about it. Also, I heard him speaking about other people a coupld of times to find out later he did the same for me and my BDR in other meetings. That's all in terms of trust in practice. Also, for some regions, they push on selling and they have done zero market research. Therefore their product is not only worse than competitions, but also 10 times more expensive. Money as with other companies, but the amount of stress and mismanagement - not worth a month staying there!",5 people found this review helpful

The company is a rocket ship, still. But it's at the expense of its people. Below are a few of the cons I find most frustrating. - Micro Management on an extreme scale. I joined just before the pandemic and it has gotten continually worse since being forced to work from home. You don't feel trusted. - Unrealistic workloads. - Encouraged to manage your work life balance but chastised if you actually do it. I've been scolded for having my car serviced at 2pm, or taking annual leave at a quarter cut off to celebrate a birthday. - Meetings for meetings sake burning precious time. - Saturated account sets. Prospects get bombarded continually from all angles of Salesforce and have been for over a decade. - Lead generation is down to you. You have to be BDR, AE and even SE on some opportunities, unless you're in the enterprise/strategic accounts. I have not had more than 3 leads passed to me in almost 18 months. - Always an ""urgent"" action that needs to be taken.

182,Great solutions and people - inept local senior management,,3.0,Salesforce has some fantastic solutions and some really passionate people who care about their customers and each other. The benefits are great and when you have the right team you can win business. For the right job this company is a no brainer to join.,Local leadership is so focused on female diversity outcomes that talented internal and external candidates that don’t fit that profile are overlooked. Very “stepford wives” without any people of colour in senior roles within the CEO’s direct business (at least that was the case last year). Lots of people politic to get promoted - straight talkers and doers are often side lined vs “brand” individuals. Targets have become unrealistic and territories are carved so thin that by staying you are effectively giving yourself a pay cut each year. The culture has become bloated with self importance. Nothing humble about the way it’s presented. Over focus on certification and pointless training. Seems to keep an army busy while the workers barely get time to see customers anymore. Work/life balance depends on your role. Plenty of people seem to have lots of time to be volunteering or involved in non-revenue generating activities while other people are smashed.,9 people found this review helpful
