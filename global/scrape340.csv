0,Marketing Machine,"Jul 30, 2020 - Business Development Representative in Chicago, IL",2.0,- Looks great on resume - Decent training,Do a quick search of Salesforce marketing spend compared to other big tech companies and you’ll see why working here is such highly touted. The company has shown its true colors during the covid pandemic. Impossible quotas as is with no quota relief during pandemic. BDRs are measured by how much Monopoly money they put into Salesforce and how buddy buddy they are with their AEs. The company says one thing to the press but treats its employees a completely different way. I have not felt any instance of “Ohana” since being here even though I was super excited to work for Salesforce. BDRs feel as if it’s them against the world at this company and have to deal with AE ego on a consistent basis.,4 people found this review helpful

26,Toxic and flawed work environment in sales recruiting (and recruiting in general),,1.0,Great company to have on your resume Learn how to balance a high volume workload Overtime pay,"During my time here, I've witnessed countless examples of discrimination and inappropriate comments from management, specifically my manager. This behavior is accepted. Salesforce is not a company that welcomes open, honest dialogue and feedback. If you disagree with management in any way, expect retaliation. There are people in management positions who have no business being there. When you have questionable leadership, it causes many issues and problems that go unnoticed. In my case, I was subjected to report to someone who lacks the basic qualities a good manager must have: empathy, understanding, active listening, patience, strong communication, transparency, and loyalty to your team. Don't expect any of those qualities in many of the managers at Salesforce. The managers here continue to ""kick down and kiss up"" to get to where they are today. My manager lacked maturity, basic professionalism, and self-awareness . He has said some derogatory things about women, made incredibly inappropriate comments on team calls, and speaks to some of the females on his team in such a brash, disrespectful manner. It did not help that the person he reported to, the next manager in the line of management, was inherently cold and disconnected. I have never seen such self-serving managers in my professional career. The recruiting managers and leaders will never have your back. Example: If a candidate feels as though he/she should have gotten a job they interviewed for and chooses to retaliate against the recruiter ( example: write a bad Glassdoor review and name you), recruiting leadership will reach to place blame on the recruiter. Bad Glassdoor review = bad for the brand and the ""brand"" is #1 priority at Salesforce. EVERYTHING that is done at this company is done as an effort to strengthen their brand. It's all for show. All they care about is being perceived as ""a company that cares"" with an ""Ohana"" culture, when in reality, it is all about optics and concealing an incredibly abusive, toxic culture. Be prepared to also have a manager that takes credit for your success. You did well because they ""set you up for it"" and ""coached you."" (During my entire time there, I have never learned anything valuable from my first line manager - with the exception of what kind of manager I will not be one day) Recruiting here is a factory. It's all about pumping out hires quarter after quarter and hitting an arbitrary hiring number at any expense, even if you have to bend the rules a bit. Example: having people have start dates when they're still employed at their current employer, pressuring sales candidates to start immediately without giving a notice period to their current employers and using manipulative tactics like saying ""If they really want this job, they will make it happen""...etc. Salesforce hires most - if not all - recruiters on contract first. They reassure you that the contract thing is just a Salesforce formality and should you be a perform well, you will be converted in a year or less. I saw first-hand a couple of very high-performing recruiters get let go simply because they refused to play the ridiculous political game that is expected of you. Recruiting here is a rat race and lacks any nuance or creativity. As a recruiter, you do not have a voice or opinion. You are a sheep in the herd following the leaders. The ""leaders"" only care about branding, how the company is perceived, and how they themselves look to their leaders. They care very little about the actual recruiters doing the work. Recruiters are at the very bottom of the totem pole. If you hint at any disscontempt with your role, team, manager, company - you will be shunned. I can't speak for all of the recruiting teams and the entire company, but this is my honest feedback about Sales Recruiting at Salesforce. I wanted to provide honest feedback to future candidates who are considering leaving full-time roles for this often unpleasant role. If you choose to, use this as a resume booster if you're trying to break into the tech industry and then get out. Understand that the behavior you will witness there and the treatment you will likely receive is not okay. This is not how respectable companies operate. There are so many better opportunities at other SaaS companies where you will be treated with dignity and respect.",40 people found this review helpful

46,#Dreamjob Not Always,,3.0,"Quality work/life balance - This is baked into the benefits and culture. Although, you need a manager that actually supports this for you. If you have that it is great but, when you don't it can feel defeating. Personally, I have experienced the good and the bad with this. Training - Trailhead is a wonderful tool that provides a great introduction to many products/services. It's self-guided and you can pursue what interests you at your own pace. Time off to volunteer - Again a great benefit but, your manager has to be supportive of your endeavors. Employees are encouraged to give back using the 1/1/1 model. On one hand you are praised if you meet or exceed the number of hours you give back. If you don't have a manager or a team that does a lot of volunteer work, you might be criticized or singled out for ""wasting time."" Free Snacks - This is nice when you need a 3:00 snack or can't get out for lunch. Access to great perks - Wellness activities, a gym, workout classes, a benefit you can use to pay for massages. Unlimited vacation time, sometimes free tickets to events.","""Diversity"" - There's a good lip service but, the reality is that upper management is mostly white. Until there is massive change in how recruiting and cultivating talent happens in the tech industry white guys are going to begat more white guys. Chances are pretty good they don't have friends or connections who are POC. This also holds true from people who come from other tech companies. When rats jump the ship they tend to bring other rats with them. Not so subtle hints that you have to hold a ""right"" set of beliefs/values - you have to get onboard or made to feel like an outsider. If you question or don't hold a certain The idea that Salesforce can save the human race - Salesforce is an innovative tech company with products and services that help customers do business. Be that! While SF is the biggest and holds a huge marketshare, it has created this idea that it can somehow save the world. Surrounded by lots of people who don't actually work with you - there are some teams that have a larger representation in certain hubs but, if you have a team that is largely based in one hub it can get lonely being surrounded by people who are largely irrelevant to your daily work life. It can also infringe on W/L balance. Ohana seating - Gross. Everyone needs their own desk and space. ""Data Driven"" - Sometimes translates to manipulating for personal gain and benefit.",13 people found this review helpful

Pip, Ian) have been received positively.","Your experience here will completely depend on your direct manager and reporting line - and that's a very mixed bag of people. There is a lot of ego at play in some leaders and a total lack of EQ/empathy - be sure to interview your manager through the hiring process. There is nothing as demotivating as a sales manager who doesn't have basic leadership skills or self awareness. They have over hired Account Executives as they believe that this will drive limitless growth in the region. Result being that everyone has territories that are too small to give them a reasonable chance at succeeding. Attainment is poor even from those who have been with the business a number of years and have been successful in their previous roles. This DOESN'T stop huge amounts of pressure being placed on each individual to hit pipe gen and sales targets (even during COVID). Very few people have hit their quota or anywhere near it in the last few years. 5-7 years ago this probably would have been a great place to work but it has changed considerably since then. People don't trust the anonymous feedback surveys so the business doesn't understand the huge amount of grumbling that is happening behind the scenes. AEs are unhappy and many are looking elsewhere. But management also does its best to make you fearful about leaving in order to keep you in place to avoid more turnover. They made most of their customer success group redundant last year. Aside from COVID, there seems to be a major aversion to letting people work from home which to me highlights that there is a lack of trust in their people. Some management speak down to their team like they are children. Very few female leaders in the sales team - not sure the organisation is honestly asking themselves why this is? People talk the talk about diversity because it's a SFDC value but that's not necessarily how they really think or execute. I don't even think most of them are capable of thinking outside their own experience.",18 people found this review helpful

84,Fake culture - it’s all branding,"Mar 13, 2020 - Anonymous Employee in San Francisco, CA",1.0,"Comp package is decent, benefits are good","I’ve only been with the company for a few months, and it was my dream company to work for. I fell for the hype, the branding, the “perks”, the “culture”, the philanthropy. Now, I can speak from experience that the culture is fake. Benioff might mean well and the company might provide perks so that from those on the outside looking in, this is a great place to work. I just know that during the months I’ve been here, I haven’t had any time to see the Salesforce park or have coffee in the Ohana floor. I’m on a small team and other than my manager, the others have not said 3 words to me, unless I’m talking to them in a group setting. No “how was your day?” Or “Do you want me to show you around?” How’s that for culture? I tried to walk to a meeting with a team member and she completely ignored me. I’ve never felt so lonely at a job. The Ohana seating makes it impossible to get to know anyone. I am so busy from the moment I get in but accomplish nothing. We have so many meetings... meetings 85% of my days to talk about nothing that can’t get accomplished through emails. Or the meeting is about the same things we just met about 2 hours ago. The culture is not about being productive or getting things done. It’s about looking/feeling like important topics are being discussed, sitting in conference rooms, and over complicating the strategy. We just spin and spin and then we go home, and do it again the next day. Every single thing I’ve worked on since I started have been scratched or changed because the process or overall strategy has changed. How does anyone work around here or get anything done in this type of setting and without concrete decisions being made? The on-boarding is very chaotic and management isn’t aligned with the actual on-boarding process. They don’t factor in how long the mandatory trailhead courses take or take the time to onboard you. Becoming Salesforce and Bootcamps are just thrown into the schedule and are disruptive to the day-to-day workflow. (I’ve had to reschedule because there are other meetings that conflict). I met someone, also new but on another team, who complained she doesn’t have time for bootcamp. Maybe it’s not necessary? Just show the new employees how to navigate the elevators in the tower... this took me weeks to figure out on my own.",50 people found this review helpful

Employee Success is a joke at this company. It was total chaos trying to get anything done with way too many cooks in the kitchen. If you're an older employee, don't expect any of your previous work experience to mean anything. If it didn't happen at Salesforce, it didn't happen at all. Compensation is definitely lower than the other big tech firms in San Francisco. Stop using so Hawaiian jargon and ridiculous costume characters. It's a business, not a pre-school.

Middle management is huge popularity contest. What bugged me this most is the preaching of diversity and inclusion, yet they constantly hire and promote a very disproportionate WHITE staff in their Sales org. Particularly evident in their Central teams. Very very few minority leaders and individual contributors are actually hired, retained, groomed for success, and promoted.

110,"Mostly positive experience, even after my role was eliminated",,4.0,"There are a lot of perks of working at Salesforce, at least for my role. I had the option of working from home and many people in my role did so as well. The office has open (""Ohana"") seating to accommodate that. This suited my personality well but if you prefer face-to-face meetings with your team members, this might be a negative for you. Throughout my time at Salesforce I had coworkers and managers that lived in different states than me. Which is fine nowadays considering all the virtual meeting options. There are free snacks and drinks in the break room. If you become a parent while at Salesforce, you have the option of taking up to 6 months paternity leave at 80% pay, which is outstanding at least by US standards. I never ended up taking the full 6 months for either of the kids I had while employed at Salesforce, I guess out of a dumb sense of duty to my coworkers and Salesforce. Don't do what I did. Take the full 6 months and don't regret it. I enjoyed all the people that I worked with and I had the opportunity to work with a lot of big name accounts. Overall I thought it was a positive experience. My role was eliminated which is why I had to leave Salesforce. I was not happy about it but they were very generous. After my role was eliminated and my role responsibilities were taken away, they continued to pay me for two months while I looked for internal and external opportunities. I was able to find another opportunity outside of Salesforce prior to the end of the 2nd month. Had I not found another role, however, they would have given me a generous severance package in addition to what I had already been paid. I would imagine that is a lot more than most other companies would do.","My role (and other roles in my part of the organization) became very specialized over time, which I assume to was to help with efficiency in client work. But it also meant that I was doing a lot of the same tasks over and over again. I found there was little opportunity to branch out to take on responsibilities of other roles or to learn another role. I knew several people who left Salesforce because they became frustrated at their lack of advancement. People in my role also had a billable utilization goal of 36 hours a week. If you did not have that much time billable, it was seen as an issue. But you are not always in charge of how much work you had or what work was available. Which is true of many businesses, I know. Also, if you wanted to take time off, you needed to find a backup (or multiple backups) to take on your account work while you are out. Which can be difficult if everyone is trying to work 36 billable hours a week. And you had to train them if they had never worked on your account before. So taking time off was a chore, at least for my role. I ended up taking only maybe 2 weeks off during a year. I regularly hit my cap of 300 PTO hours and stopped accumulating PTO. And the billable utilization goal was pushed so much that they started tying it to the quarterly bonuses. In the end, it didn't end up meaning much because my role was eliminated even though at the time I was regularly billing 36+ hours a week. Ultimately, I would preach to not drink the Kool Aid. They preach that everyone that works there is part of the ""Ohana"" and is family but don't buy it. This is probably not new to a lot of you, but it's just marketing. They are a business first. They don't really care about you. You have to look out for yourself first and foremost. If you start buying into it even just a little bit, that's when you don't take as much time off as you should or don't take your full 6 months of paternity leave out of some sense of obligation to the ""Ohana."" Take advantage of everything they give you down to the last PTO hour because they will happily discard you without hesitation when they don't see value in you as an ""Ohana"" member any longer. If you feel stagnant in your role, use your free work time to help yourself or get out of there because they will not help you take another role.",13 people found this review helpful

158,Fake culture - it’s all branding,,1.0,"Comp package is decent, benefits are good","I’ve only been with the company for a few months, and it was my dream company to work for. I fell for the hype, the branding, the “perks”, the “culture”, the philanthropy. Now, I can speak from experience that the culture is fake. Benioff might mean well and the company might provide perks so that from those on the outside looking in, this is a great place to work. I just know that during the months I’ve been here, I haven’t had any time to see the Salesforce park or have coffee in the Ohana floor. I’m on a small team and other than my manager, the others have not said 3 words to me, unless I’m talking to them in a group setting. No “how was your day?” Or “Do you want me to show you around?” How’s that for culture? I tried to walk to a meeting with a team member and she completely ignored me. I’ve never felt so lonely at a job. The Ohana seating makes it impossible to get to know anyone. I am so busy from the moment I get in but accomplish nothing. We have so many meetings... meetings 85% of my days to talk about nothing that can’t get accomplished through emails. Or the meeting is about the same things we just met about 2 hours ago. The culture is not about being productive or getting things done. It’s about looking/feeling like important topics are being discussed, sitting in conference rooms, and over complicating the strategy. We just spin and spin and then we go home, and do it again the next day. Every single thing I’ve worked on since I started have been scratched or changed because the process or overall strategy has changed. How does anyone work around here or get anything done in this type of setting and without concrete decisions being made? The on-boarding is very chaotic and management isn’t aligned with the actual on-boarding process. They don’t factor in how long the mandatory trailhead courses take or take the time to onboard you. Becoming Salesforce and Bootcamps are just thrown into the schedule and are disruptive to the day-to-day workflow. (I’ve had to reschedule because there are other meetings that conflict). I met someone, also new but on another team, who complained she doesn’t have time for bootcamp. Maybe it’s not necessary? Just show the new employees how to navigate the elevators in the tower... this took me weeks to figure out on my own.",50 people found this review helpful

165,"Not what it used to be, would not recommend",,2.0,"Great snacks and cool offices, decent benefits, casual office attire","This used to be my dream job, I loved telling everyone I worked here and how awesome it was. Then as time went on, I realized it was all fake. The marketing team makes you believe that everything is perfect even when it's not. There is no way to move up even though people say you can. You will be promised one thing then later told the opposite. To move to a different role internally you have to move to a position of the same level or below, you cannot go up (called diagonally) in another department. Even if you make it happen, they keep you at the same pay and level for 6+ months so you will do more work for the same pay. There is NO INCENTIVE TO STAY!! I have known so many people who leave for this reason, then come back a year or so later 3-6 grades higher with better pay and benefits. Recruiters love that because they say it shows how great the company is that people come back, they could have saved themselves time and money by just promoting or transferring the person to the place they wanted to be at. My manager left after a few years and then they hired someone externally who had NO MANAGEMENT EXPERIENCE EVER!!! He was the worst manager I have ever had by far, he was rude, disrespectful, sexist, inappropriate, and completely useless. I was appalled at the way he treated his employees and when I brought it up to HR they basically said I couldn't prove it. Then other employees from a completely different department witnessed him scream at people and they went to HR and still the case was closed because ""lack of evidence"". Several employees were asked to work overtime without pay which is illegal for hourly employees. When I told my bosses boss that I was leaving, they offered me a promotion, but I would have had to move cross-country, and I was told there was no budget for moving costs, so I would pay them all on my own. As for salary, since it was a ""cheaper cost of living"" that there would be no increase. I laughed at this insulting offer to work more, have more responsibility and no increase in money while moving cross country. I declined the offer and they were somehow shocked. I left and never looked back, I am so much happier now that I left.",9 people found this review helpful

Very nice benefits package Generous pay,"It does not pay to have integrity at this company. You'll do well if you can smile and say ""everything is fine"" while the building you're in is actively burning to the ground. I was sent on multiple interviews for a position within the company in a department that I wanted to transfer to before being told they would not actually hire me and were just sending me on the interviews for reasons completely unknown to me. To be clear, there was a hiring freeze already in place and they STILL wanted me to interview more with no actual plan to hire/transfer me. The ""Family First"" policy is garbage. They said this motto about a million times when I worked there. When I needed it so I could care for my family member (My fiancee needed major back surgery), I was told this would not be a problem, was later told this was a major problem and she wasn't family, and then, after we got married, no one checked to see what I said about us being married was true. To be clear, Salesforce wanted to tell me who could be my family but then didn't care if it was actually true in the end. I could have lied and had the wedding we actually wanted and had been planning, instead of rushing to get married at the courthouse so I could get the leave and she could get the surgery on schedule. There doesn't seem to be a strong decision-making process. I was sent on retreats I didn't need to go on to hang out with people I never saw or communicated with while I needed to be at home to handle important matters. I was told this trip was imperative and I couldn't miss it. When I got there, no one knew what the trip was for and it turned out to just be drinking and games and a pep rally or two.

Leadership has been telling their people that they are working on a fair and unbiased promotion process for years, but there is no proof that any work has been done. Management can often make employees feel like they are replaceable. I hate to break it to them, but smart/talented recruiters do not find Salesforce Recruiting a compelling enough organization to work for. If leadership wants to retain people, they need to have productive conversations around succession planning and salary increases. Salesforce Recruiters and Sourcers severely underpaid. Recruiting leadership preaches about how Salesforce is ahead of the game with URM (under-represented minorities) recruiting. In reality, it is nothing but a numbers game for them. The more hires they make, the better they look in front of Marc Benioff. They've been so fixated on increasing the numbers, that they've completely forgotten the meaning/importance of having a diverse workplace.

Management will set you up to succeed by providing all the resources, trainings, and other tools needed to make it to ""get to the next level"" and advance your career. I personally have no immediate plans to switch teams because I currently love the work that I am doing right now. I have seen people easily move across different teams and organizations (lateral and vertical) within Salesforce without issue. This is important to those that want to eventually work on different projects/teams/technologies within the company. The company promotes a lot of volunteering for employees and is consistently active within the community. It's recommended and encouraged for employees to volunteer and give back and they set a side a large amount of VTO (Volunteer Time Off) for you to do so. I absolutely love this because volunteering makes such a big impact to those in need. You are treated with dignity and respect working here. I have never come across any issues while working here but there is always an open channel to communicate with management (direct management or other management) if you do encounter anything. Senior management is very honest and transparent during meetings/emails/town halls, ect. with what is going on within our organization and company as a whole. Besides all of the stuff mentioned above, there are: - Excellent Work/Life Balance (I've never worked a weekend, I get off on time each day, and have never felt any stress while working here) .

236,Culture of Learning and Problem Solving!,,5.0,"I got hired a few months back as part of Salesforce's Success grad program. Coming straight out of college where I got to study and work on interesting challenges in 7 different countries, I was looking for a culture that promotes continuous learning and problem-solving. Salesforce proved to be beyond my expectations. Being one of the most innovative companies in the world, there are so many moving parts that make this company great. There is always interesting stuff to fill your plate with. What amazes me is that even though the company has grown to a headcount of 40k+, the opportunities and encouragement for cross-team collaborations match that of a startup.","If someone is hesitant to change and prefers a predictable 9-5 schedule, Salesforce may not be the best fit.",Be the first to find this review helpful
237,Quality company,,5.0,"Onboarding is 2 weeks for us techies - very comprehensive and required, no manager can steal you from it. Gives confidence and great info to get your hands dirty quickly. Company is NOT a rigid, formal, old school shop, neither is a start-upy - it seems to be a well run, human-oriented enterprise with focus on educating the workers and giving them the right tools. Management is very attentive to feedbacks and surveys, they discuss any negative found in process and attempt to address it. Folks are helpful, mostly transparent though there is a bit of that cast-system mentality in some folks. Management is not much tolerant to silos, they try hard to break those.","Intense at times. Silo breaking must go on. Process of getting approvals to push features is not basic. Context switching between projects, some shutdowns / restarts based on resources is pretty regular, at least in my org. SF Downtown location is challenging for some due to long commute, though shuttles are offered along 101 and other routes.",Be the first to find this review helpful

250,6 months in and things just keep getting better.,"Jan 23, 2017 - Account Executive",5.0,"The product works. If you've ever worked somewhere that the product doesn't work and you have that in the back of your mind in every customer meeting, it's incredibly defeating. If vetted properly for use cases and the customer is bought-in from a change management standpoint, your customers will have success and continue growing and adding services. There isn't a better name to have on your email signature, now or for the future. The things we get to work on and sell, and the conversations we get to have with our customers, are incredible. You can make a ton of money here. The base salaries are excellent and the potential to earn once you've made your number and hit accelerators are great. While it is hard to hit your number, we have the resources and support to go as far you're willing to work toward.","I can't think of any, though cons could be perceived if you aren't comfortable with an extremely fast paced publicly traded organization.

Their flagship products such as sales cloud and service cloud are both highly regarded by analysts and customers. Great benefits and lots of perks.,"Have you ever felt like just a number to a company? Well once you start your job at salesforce you become just one of the many thousands of AEs they have hired. You will be given a territory that will ultimately dictate how well you perform. Some AEs are given 2-3 territories while others are given just one. Regardless of your territory, you will have the exact same quota as those with larger ones. Its a numbers game to management. Your manager will want 2-3 of his or her AEs to do really well while everyone else struggles. You will have a monthly quota, your manager will be tasked with grinding you every month for every last dollar possible you can bring in. Not to mention 3 quarter ends and 1 year end, which many managers make you feel like the world is ending thereafter. Forget about a vacation at month end, quarter end or god forbid you have to miss January 31st.",15 people found this review helpful
254,Just another cog in the tech machine. You don't matter.,"Jan 2, 2020 - Executive Assistant in San Francisco, CA",1.0,"Benefits, meeting other unhappy colleagues who helped me during my terrible experience at Salesforce","Another tech giant trying to spread the company culture kool aid but doesn’t recognize or address terrible leaders and managers or self appointed “lead EAs”. Very toxic, backstabbing politics going on amongst executive assistants which creates an entire group of disgruntled, distrustful, and power hungry EAs and makes most EAs carry a bad reputation at Salesforce. Execs and managers who have EAs: some of them need serious management training and learn how to treat everyone under them fairly. This was by far some of the worst treatment I’ve ever seen from an exec who had an EA. Micromanaging, having other people spy on the EA and report back to him about the EA's whereabouts and movement.. The EA was treated like a prisoner. Also, there are some EAs who support C-level people and they act as if they are the exec's themselves. They wield their execs' status for their own power and control over others. It's ridiculous and I don't know if the execs who have EAs even know that their EAs are doing this. I hated working with any execs who had EAs. It was always a massive hinderance to my work progress. I don't understand Salesforce and the EA culture.. some are really great EAs but some are terrible and unfortunately they are the EAs at the top.. usually supporting SVP and up. I wouldn’t buy into their culturally appropriated “OHANA” and other Hawaiian sayings. It’s all a facade.",22 people found this review helpful
