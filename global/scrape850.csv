And flexible working is totally supported. You are allowed do what works for you and micro-management does not exist here. - Amazing people. I've never worked with a harder working bunch of people. Generally people shy away from taking on extra work, however here people will volunteer their time just to help you. Everybody wants to help! To add to this, because there's a low attrition rate due to the amazing benefits, working environment and such. You actually have experienced people working there who know what they're talking about. So for new people, it's easy to get assistance and progress. You feel safe with all the knowledgeable people around you. - Very interesting and dynamic product! My work is so interesting because I love the product and it's always changing. It keeps things interesting and it's great teaching high-profile clients how to use-it and working with them through their use cases. Very rewarding work. - Great salary and amazing benefits!","Not many to be honest!

Work never ends. - Very performance driven, always high pressure to sell more, a lot of forecasting and at times micro-management. - Management is lacking coaching/people/leadership skills, you are heavily managed on opportunities and numbers, but very little on personal improvement. - Politics are present, as well as ego-centrism within sales & mngmnt. - Achieving your target depends on the distribution of accounts and opportunities, which changes every year. - Very complex internal organisation that can come across as impersonal at times. eg no HR and if you have questions you can only log tickets.",Be the first to find this review helpful

You are encouraged to keep a balance but that's not always possible.","- Sometimes unrealistic sales / business management expectations from product resulting in oversells, it's a solid product but there's a lot of work needed to get to a setup that will do well on the enterprise scale. Smaller setups can work but if you are looking for the big benefits it requires time investment. - The 'family feel' push internally. This is really nice when you are newly immersed in it but you also need to be wary of assuming it's like a perfect family. Families have fights, internal squabbles and sometimes break apart so always look after your own future don't expect that completely from the company. - Steep learning curve if you've never worked on Salesforce product(s) before but there is lots of help there. Still a great place to work and earn professional experience or build your career. Genuinely love the company and everything they've done for me to date.",2 people found this review helpful

Prospecting is very difficult as you sometimes only have 3-10 accounts to work with in total, but the target seems to be created from a growth mindset where every account is going through a full digital transformation. Base salaries are relatively low (compared with similar organisations), so if you're not blessed with a great patch, you are going through tough times.

106,Recruiters are worst in Salesforce,"Jul 26, 2021 - Software Engineer",1.0,Great place to work for IT,"This review is for recruiters hyd team. There were so many worst experiences with them. Trust and Transparency is the great qualities of the Salesforce. But it seems the recruiters don't care at all. Even though referred so many people, Not sure what's the problem, They never got the call for interview. Also, another experience with them, Some of the recruiters at least don't response to the pings when we ping to them for information, Even after pinging so many times. If they don't respond at least to the internal employees, not sure how they interact with the interview candidates. This is very disappointing how they treat internal employees and at least they should respond. I understand ping people are busy some days or times. But not 2/7 or week. Honestly the recruiter experience is worst experience, They don't care at all. They don't respect time and they don't respect individuals and don't reply to at least internal employees. Also I had heard so many that, Even after candidates performed well, Finally the result is the candidates were rejected.",2 people found this review helpful

Project teams are close knit and diversified - with multiple resources available. I love that I have both a mentor and a career coach assigned to me - I meet with both of them on a regular basis. Kcloud has a great career path that allows for growth no matter where you are in your career. I hit the ground running on my first day and haven't looked back. I was immediately accepted into the fold and encouraged to begin contributing on client calls right away. My travel has been very limited to date.","I personally don't have any cons. Leadership has an open door policy and questions are answered timely and appropriately. I do concur with the other reviews that there are a lot of projects and they're fast paced.

143,Used to be a great company to work for,,2.0,"Good Salary and benefits, some wonderfully talented people and good executives i.e. Parker Harris and Marc Benioff","Apart from the mentioned executives you have a lot of execs fighting to build their empires. Some are good but those below are doing anything to be noticed. Salesforce used to have a great culture but lost this a long time ago due to hiring talent from slow beurocratic red tape enterprises such as Oracle. They used to say they dont want to be the next Oracle but that is exactly where they have gone. Leadership within the support organization specifically is appalling, no vision, no care for employees and very blame oriented. No accountability from global support execs all they care about is ensuring if something goes wrong they can shift blame. This has resulted in a toxic environtment. That along with most new support roles being only hired in their India offices is leading to a poor experience from employees elsewhere and customers are suffering for it also with unhappy employees. This is not to say there are not some great departments but support is certainly not one of them, stay out of the support organization.",8 people found this review helpful

147,"Good, if you drink the Kool-Aid...",,3.0,"+ A very reputable brand to work for in the enterprise software and SaaS space. + Huge range of products that can fit into all different parts of an enterprise. + Strong revenue projections and big growth aspirations. + (Mostly) clear and transparent communications from leadership and senior management. + Open feedback culture, with regular employee surveys and check-ins—with employee survey results being published openly across the organisation. + Clear corporate strategy and goals, which trickles down to each employee through the V2MoM process. + Outstanding benefits package and above-average pay rates. + Open, sharing culture, with seemingly endless resources available. + Strong support network within the SE organisation and a willingness to help from other SEs. + Lots of internal resources around talent development and career development. + A very generous education allowance (£5,000 in the UK) that can be put towards almost any course of your choice to help further your career and development. + Excellent treatment of a global workforce mostly working from home, such as home office allowances, extra days off etc.","- Anyone not in a direct quota carrying roles is treated as a second-class citizen, and the sales side of the business (e.g. account executives and sales leadership) is revered and constantly lauded on internal calls. - Obsessive fixation on hitting quotas and revenue targets, which drives a culture of upselling (even when the customer doesn't really need it—despite their ""Customer Success"" value). - It is difficult to relate the SE pay and bonus to company performance—despite ever-growing revenues and beating last year's results, this never really translates into a significant increase in pay/bonus. - Murky promotion and career progression process that gets called out every year in the employee survey, but nothing really gets done about it. Hiring budget seems to be spent on bringing in more AEs (the quality of which varies considerably). - The open, sharing culture has led to oversharing, and useful information and documents are scattered across a load of different sources (Google Drive, Quip, Slack, various Salesforce orgs)—with no single way of searching across all of these. - Lots of internal ""noise"", which can distract from the day job (webinars, endless all-hands calls, irritating Slack channels etc). - Internal culture can feel a bit cultish at times and there is a growing disconnect between the US and non-US workforce. You have to drink the Kool-Aid to get ahead. - The internal Salesforce org (Org62) is a mess making it very difficult to navigate, Lots of duplicate data (e.g. accounts and contacts) across the organisation, which leads to internal fighting over territories/customers. - The company swings between big corporate and scrappy startup: some internal processes are excessively bureaucratic and long-winded (e.g. requiring manager approval for a $5 software purchase), and elsewhere decisions are taken on a whim. - Some employees can feel ostracised if they don't submit to the (exceedingly) left-leaning, social justice obsessed political views of the organisation. - A globally distributed workforce means that emails and Slack messages come in at all hours of the day—depending on the team, internal meetings can start early or run late into the evening.",12 people found this review helpful

It's fast paced, you make what you deserve based on how much you work, but the training and development is INTENSE. You are empowered over and over again to be successful - so if you aren't hitting or exceeding your number, it's not because of the patch, or the situation - it's because you aren't taking enough advantage of the enablement.","Sales is sales and with a resetting quota at the end of every month, you have to be prepared to reset at $0 and do it all over again. Even though we get 19 Days off in the first year, it's hard to take time off because the less you work, the less you make. Company is growing from a startup to a major corporation - that growth means there are a lot of things that are changing and you hear about the ""good old days"" a lot - as if you missed out on how things used to be (not pre pandemic, I mean like 10 years ago) and things have changed a lot.",4 people found this review helpful

Success is heavily dependent on the territory and winning the ""Salesforce lottery.""

If you are looking to move verticals etc.. you can easily be blocked by your manager if they want to keep you for their self-interests.
