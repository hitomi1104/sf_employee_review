,cons
59,there is nothing very specific. but very fast-growing and innovative company
369,"Since the company is growing fast , all sort of people are there in middle management and these people are not following the basic Ohana culture of salesforce which Marc is dreaming about. If you are from an acquired company and not into salesforce tech stack, then be very careful , you will be fired immediately after your knowledge transfer and if they feel that you are no more required to carry on with the work, even though you had spent years together in the acquired company to build the product. No help whatsoever from HR or hiring managers for internal openings even though you learn and get certified in salesforce related technologies."
380,"It is a fast growing, large company with a complex org structure. Navigating the right teams and people takes time, but everyone is willing to help you."
434,"More as a side-effect of a large and also fast-growing company, there might be some occasional (ad-hoc) bureaucracy in some activities. Furthermore, some temporary lack of integration (information/communication) with the Headquarters and major branches can also be felt, especially by new acquisitions or alliances."
463,very fast growing company so organization changes frequently
485,Pains and politics from growing fast. Flat management structure makes it challenging to understand career path in the company. Products and platforms and their nomenclature are constantly changing which can be a challenge to keep up and stay aligned and then communicate effectively to the customer sometimes.
558,I really don't have anything negative to say. It's a fast growing dynamic company and it's great place to work.
592,"Very fast growing company, a lot of movement within teams and across management. Good in the way that it produces a lot of opportunity for promotion but also challenging in terms of maintaining momentum and team dynamics."
862,"The culture has significantly changed. A year ago I was proud and excited to be a part of the company. The Lightning release was a shining moment for how the company's culture can facilitate great things. However, there have been a number of changes over the last year that have slowly eroded the magic - starting with some of the new leadership. Our group has become more fragmented and less collaborative. There's more fear of making mistakes and the general sense of trust and support for our work from our leadership has gone way down. The transparency and access we had upwards is becoming more hazy largely because of layers being added. My autonomy and empowerment to make decisions is slipping away. Politics were always there, but now they're something you have to consider daily. You used to be judged based on the work you created and what you shipped, it doesn't feel that way anymore. Some of my favorite people have already moved on. Perhaps it's just the nature of a company growing this fast. There's not a clear avenue for safely giving upwards feedback for our group. My hope is that someone up top takes notice and makes corrections."
966,"Need to like a fast pace of work, constant change, high level of travel, the company is continuing to mature, but there the growing pains can be tough"
1878,-company is growing so fast that it’s getting harder to be nimble
1935,-company is growing so fast that it’s getting harder to be nimble
2592,"The rate of change is huge. Often the ready, fire aim approach doesn't work when we are now a large company. We are like the awkward teenager who is growing too fast and fumbling along the way."
2942,"Not a start-up anymore! Less potential for getting what a fast growing company has to offer. If you were starting your career here 10 years ago, you would be in a great place now"
3001,"It is a fast growing, large company with a complex org structure. Navigating the right teams and people takes time, but everyone is willing to help you."
3044,Fast Paced - if you are not used to a fast growing company this could be a challenge. Personally it has helped me thrive in the first 6 months and it motivates me to see the pace of growth and change
3097,"very few cons. You have to like change as it is a very fast growing company, and the pace of work can be challenging for some."
3931,"-As it is growing, some red tape has been introduced but is still much faster moving than any other company of its size."
4630,"Due to the fast-growing nature of the company, work-life balance takes a hit."
4781,"As I’ve only just started all of my comments are about first impressions, so please take that into consideration. I have gotten the feeling that the company has grown so fast it is suffering from some growing pains. By all means a good problem to have, but it means process workflows can be a bit clunky."
4812,"The company is growing and with that comes some bottlenecks in getting things done. For it's size though, it is still incredible how fast Salesforce is still able to innovate."

4891,"Because Salesforce is growing so fast – doubling its workforce and revenue over two years – many things get lost in the shuffle. Some teams have crushing workloads, while others are virtually forgotten. The prevailing infrastructure of the company is a parochial network of vice presidents operating independently. This leads to disconnection, and occasionally chaos. Teams duplicate work, work in contradictory directions, and compete pointlessly. Territoriality for budget and resources is rampant. There are no centralized checks and balances. If you have a bad or unethical warlord, you may be asked to do things that are counterproductive or even hurtful. The patchwork of fiefdoms across the company is so disconnected that many teams are unaware of similar teams within the company. Efforts to organize or connect strategies are met with resistance and sometimes hostility. A chief strategy officer with a team of connected project managers could address this, but many VPs don't want accountability. The result is work that doesn't rise above mediocrity. Salesforce is a great company comprised of dozens of mediocre companies. Those mediocre companies don't want to connect and be great because their leaders don't want to lose status. Once you see that you can't unsee it. Many workers grow cynical as a result. The famed ""Ohana"" (Hawaiian for family) doesn't penetrate the 300-yard stare of hardened coworkers who don't say hello in elevators."

5154,"Its very easy to get stuck- company is growing much too fast and your own individual team is really ran like its own company, which is not always a positive. Extremely political- buckle up if thats not what your used to. Very hard to get in, and even harder to move around once you're here."
5872,Sales culture is tough; company is growing fast and it tries to keep the growth up every quarter at all costs.
6012,"May face some challenges in collaboration. Can be an ego-driven environment. The company is extremely fast-paced and intense. For those who like a more laid-back environment, it can be a quite stressful environment. The company is growing so quickly that it sometimes feel like more of a start-up."
6074,"""Fillers"". I call them ""fillers"" because that's what they are...people that were hired in haste to simple fill roles in an organization that is growing so fast, they had to be hired quickly. While they may have gone through multiple rounds of interviews, it seems there are many execs that got through that shouldn't have and are just filling a role in the org chart. And they don't do s*&^. They may have had extremely successful positions at other companies, but Salesforce isn't like other companies. They only slow you down...so if you're smart and have your i's dotted and t's crossed, just go over them and it's not really looked down upon. Tomorrow. You're only as good as the deal you have committed tomorrow. Doesn't matter if you're at 200% of quota for the year 6 months into it ...that actually only amplifies what is expected of you. It's a con...but in reality...it's also not too bad...unless you're in a Sales role that isn't an AE (i.e. SE) because you're capped. Salesforce has the SE's I've ever come across in the industry, and I don't think they're treated as fairly as they should be. Marketeering. This is a new issue at Salesforce... It used to be the case that marketing & PM were in line and no one sold on futures. Over the past 12 months, that has changed...moving closer to an Oracle-like model where the vision is pitched and then they try to build it. Equity. I'm not sure who is getting it, but it isn't long term sales people. Seekingalpha? They couldn't be more wrong. Granted, the ESPP program is fantastic, but once you get beyond entry level, it would be nice to see something. It can be disheartening to hear RVP's (in 2012 I swear they only brought in people as RVP's...""What? You're an RVP of WHAT? And have no reports?!?!?"") and other new employees talking about selling their RSU's or options when they haven't really done anything for the company yet and you've committed the better part of a decade. Commit. This is probably the biggest ""Con"" at Salesforce if you're an AE or in sales. Salesforce is an accurate machine...it really is...based on the subscription model, a great portion of deferred rev is already established and known...but they want your sales opps just as accurate and mgmt will force or override you on your deals if you think differently. Territory. Don't come to Salesforce thinking you'll be able to pick and choose. It was picked over 5 years ago. You'll more than likely get something you don't want. End of discussion. While it seems like it should be the biggest ""con"", it's not. Because everything I listed in the ""Pros"" section means you will constantly have something new and innovative to sell to that minuscule territory you have that no one else can. I mentioned in the ""Pros"" section that some of the long-termers (those that have been around 10+ years) are one of the best things about the company. They ARE. There are also a handful of high level execs that just need to go...they don't do anything...they show up at meetings and say hello and leave... and you better keep your mouth shut. It sucks. Because at one time they were amazing. Now, just awful."
6129,"The company is growing so fast that its hard to keep up with the new hires and also be available to answer questions to help onboard newbies. My job is to sell. Period. BUT, every week there is something new I have to do (Take a survey, Attend a Training, Get Certified on a new technology, Update my V2MOM, Update my performance review, attend a product session, attend a partner session, etc. Its a bit overwhelming at times."
6171,"top heavy company - politics get in the way fast growing company, but not enough headcount to keep up with the pace"
6200,"Lots to learn in the first 3-6 months, very hectic. The company is growing very fast, some growing pains."
6266,"Political, corporate, RVP's can make or break you, accounts get re-shuffled every now and then, territories shrink, you are only as good as your accounts. There are Re-Org's where, leadership, accounts, support, and resources ALL change. For Example: SMB, MM, and Commercial Account groups- unless you are on the high-end (New people and leadership there too) you are subject to a ""Sweat-Shop"" style of work, It never stops there...for even the most senior sales people. They push you down, to a lower level them where you are, and make you earn getting back to where you were. A lot of smoke and mirrors, there was a Re-Org and I know if at least 10 people who left SFDC because of it. They are hiring and growing way to fast. Becoming just like the company that they make fun of all the time ""Oracle"". It's become a political and very corporate ""Suit Type's"" environment. It's a good old boy's club in NYC, and the talent is not that great. (All the talent is in Field Sales, and a few in Commercial here and there) Management is really corporate, and not that talented, picks who makes it and who dosent. IE: Backgrounds from Paychex and ADP, other payment companies, I mean, come on. All follow each-other, super cut-throat, and competitive, and not in a good way."

6799,"- Since company is growing fast in Hyderabad, there is space contention. The leadership could have planned the office space per growth plan. SF Hyderabad office has already full and they are still hiring. - Onboarding can be little better."
6909,high pressure results driven environment. Salesforce isnt the fastest growing software company by accident
6977,- not enough space for how fast the company is growing
7540,"- Pace: simply put, the frenetic company growth is unsustainable. At its peak, think of back-to-back 80 hour weeks, juggling 6 tasks at once, back-to-back meetings & calls to get the job done properly. Annual quotas that continue to go up isn't something that go on forever, right? - Management: The company is growing so fast, first-line managers are going to be the weakness that cripples this company. Not saying there aren't good managers, but there are a lot of bad ones. To fill the void, Salesforce hires externally (i.e. Oracle) who brings their less-than-desirable practice into Salesforce. Lack of homegrown leadership is the company's biggest weakness, by far - Customers get tired: We all hear our customers are tired of getting ""nickled & dimed to death"" because we keep on coming out with new features, new acquisitions, new bundles that cost ""only $xx more per user/month""."

7870,"You create your own way at Salesforce. You must be confident in your strengths and self aware of your weaknesses. They will not create that path for you, you have to do it. For some that is great, for others they need that plan laid out. Management can only help you so much in that. For a company growing this fast there are positions created everyday. You must have patience and savvy to find the next right role for yourself. Management will guide you, but you own your career. There isn't a defined path. You aren't always going to know all the options available. It's a very fast paced environment. For everyone to work together they must communicate well. This means seeking to understand, asking the right questions, and being flexible. In sales this requires confidence and humility, not arrogance. Egos can get in the way if they aren't controlled. This takes a team."
