Fake political positions, the CEO earns 20m a year, if he was concerned about the earth, poverty etc he would spare some for others.

Unfortunately for some individuals, this means their time in Sales Development is extremely extended due to external factors such industry pressures, geography and AE/BDR alignment. A little more focus on a combination of the two and finding the right balance between numerical metrics and knowledgable skills & know-how needs to be recognised/implemented. - Exposure really only to sales vs. other business units. It can feel like BDRs are being put into one bucket (sales making machines) vs. ""you can take your career anywhere"" promised in interviews.

131,Worst Recruiting,"Feb 22, 2021 - Anonymous Employee in Hyderābād",2.0,Benefits Facilities Payscale Equality of pay etc you will get these in outside market.,"Recruiting team doesn't understand your profile. A simple example if you apply for a position you will be rejected without contacting the hiring manager, Once you contact the hiring manager he was astonished to hear that your profile is rejected and then once again the interview is scheduled. Recruiting team doesnt understand the pain or the agony that the candidate will be going through till the time these guys say or comeback about anything. Waste of time. Company is good but lot of local politics which makes the company not worthy. Forget about promotions. If you refer anybody they'll be rejected even if they have the skill set, only if you have a strong connection with the hiring manager then you need to share the referral bonus and only then the candidate will be hired,",4 people found this review helpful

Majority of the people and culture is also brilliant.,"Unfortunately the on-boarding process, in my experience has been terrible. It is very much a sink or swim and sadly I had very little guidance on getting upto speed in my first 6 months which I feel has hindered my development. There is an opportunity to enable and engage new employees in a much better way. I didn't get to shoadow anyone for a week or two and 90% of things I have had to figure out on my own.",5 people found this review helpful

160,Continues to be a great place to work but..,,5.0,"- Working with some of the most talented people in the profession - Cutting edge developments - Management structure in Technology that genuinely listens and acts on feedback - Good benefits package (health, dental, wellness/fitness reclaim, education grant) - Depending on direct managers a lot of freedom to take calculated risks - Internal network very willing to help out and share knowledge and success - If you are dedicated and willing to put in the effort required you will move up the ranks but don't view this as just a 9-5 alone. You are encouraged to keep a balance but that's not always possible.","- Sometimes unrealistic sales / business management expectations from product resulting in oversells, it's a solid product but there's a lot of work needed to get to a setup that will do well on the enterprise scale. Smaller setups can work but if you are looking for the big benefits it requires time investment. - The 'family feel' push internally. This is really nice when you are newly immersed in it but you also need to be wary of assuming it's like a perfect family. Families have fights, internal squabbles and sometimes break apart so always look after your own future don't expect that completely from the company. - Steep learning curve if you've never worked on Salesforce product(s) before but there is lots of help there. Still a great place to work and earn professional experience or build your career. Genuinely love the company and everything they've done for me to date.",2 people found this review helpful

Good work culture, good benefits. You can grow well if supported by your manager.","It's not for Salesforce as a company but for some specific teams like Heroku where politics is at, it's best. People who work will get nothing and those who don't will get promotions. Even if you do your best you will not be appreciated and some who are close to the manager will be appreciated for no reason. Had a good experience till 2persons joined the team and spoiled it fully. Never supported by manager to grow in career.",4 people found this review helpful
162,"Honestly, great place to work at",,5.0,"I joined Salesforce Singapore as my first job fresh out of university, and truthfully, it's really the people that make this place an amazing place to work at. Different teams will have different ways of working for sure (dependent on the manager), but overall I find colleagues here willing to share their time and expertise. Even as a junior member of the company, I was never made to feel afraid or hesitant in approaching a more senior colleague for advice. There is a lot of trust in my team, which has been especially invaluable in this whole work-from-home situation. The autonomy and flexibility granted in my role is also surprising, but practical I suppose – considering how large the company is growing, it's difficult for a manager to micro-manage the activities of every single team member. The remuneration package is fair (not top-of-market however) and comes with lots of benefits. Most importantly, managers in Salesforce are super supportive about lateral movements within the organization, and outside of it. Telling your manager 'I would like to seek a new challenge this year' is not taboo here. I've lost count of the number of colleagues who have changed roles over the past 2 years I've been here.","Change happens constantly, and sometimes it's uncomfortable, or jarring, even. You're not suited for Salesforce if you're looking for a cushy role where you can just 'settle in' and relax. The company is always evolving, and you have to be adaptable to go along with it. A large company also means that increasingly, more operational processes have been installed. Is it a pain? Yes, sometimes. But is it bearable in the grand scheme of things? Also yes.",1 person found this review helpful
