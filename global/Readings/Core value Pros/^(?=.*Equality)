Trust, Salesforce wins through transparency, security, compliance, privacy and performance the trust of customers, employees and extended families. 2.

Equality, Salesforce believes that everyone should be seen, heard, valued and empowered to succeed, and listening to each employee's different perspectives fosters innovation, deepens human connections, and enables Salesforce becomes a better company. Salesforce has also built an employee communication site, where employees can speak up, make their own suggestions and the company's shortcomings."
