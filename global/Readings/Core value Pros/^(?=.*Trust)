318,"- Trust - Extremely transparent to such an extent that I can see the goal settings of each and every employee of Salesforce. Feedbacks are given at the right time and finally, everyone strives to do better for the team rather than the individual. Innovation - Team thinks of at-least 8 years in advance when making the roadmap. Every engineer needs to have a certification in AI/ML by 2019. This is one amazing goal where the company has invested a lot of dollars. Customer intimacy - Never seen such customer stickiness in a long time. Growth is not measured in revenues alone but also in customer satisfaction and it is taken very seriously. Diversity - Absolutely zero politics so far. Engineers are given a fair chance in every respect of their day to day lives. Ethics is highly valued."

585,"Work life balance Training - broad range of business related topics €5K education fund per year Freedom/ Trust to do your job Career Progression/ development Excellent benefits package 6 Paid volunteering days a year Honestly, I have been working technology for over a decade now and my time at salesforce has been really positive. There are tonnes of technology jobs on offer around Dublin but from speaking with friends in other companies - salesforce offer one of the best opportunities to grow your career and bank balance. Don't get me wrong - I have seen some people take on the role of SMB and within 6 months it's obvious that they just aren't a good fit for technology solution selling. I personally have had to work my behind off and thankfully this year I'll be getting promoted to MM and I really look forward to the challenge ahead of me. If your considering a job with salesforce ask yourself 1. Do I want to work for the worlds most innovative tech company? 2. Does it matter if management really encourage me to give back to the local community and do some rewarding charity work? (It's real and trust me - you'll be overwhelmed by how good it feels) 3. Is career development really that important? 4 Could i spend €5K per year educating myself? 5. Would I enjoy working for a company that has a work hard/ play hard buzz? If yes is the answer then I really don't know of a better gig than salesforce.... FYI - the reason I'm using this forum right now is because my manager just did me a huge favour regarding my current promotion and this is my way of balancing the Karma!! it was either that or buy the guy some whiskey - this is the cheaper option :-)"

Between companies and their customers or between employees and their teams; Salesforce was founded with three foundational core values: 1. Trust, Salesforce wins through transparency, security, compliance, privacy and performance the trust of customers, employees and extended families. 2. Innovation, innovation is not only reflected in the design of software, but also includes encouraging employees to innovate within the company, encouraging employees to use their imagination, and allowing each employee to use their imagination to create miracles. 3. Equality, Salesforce believes that everyone should be seen, heard, valued and empowered to succeed, and listening to each employee's different perspectives fosters innovation, deepens human connections, and enables Salesforce becomes a better company. Salesforce has also built an employee communication site, where employees can speak up, make their own suggestions and the company's shortcomings."

I have insight into product direction and how things are going financially, I have impact on who we hire and who I work with, and I get to see immediate value from the work I put in. Salesforce gives me all the tools and resources that I need to do my job, and any time I've needed help from HR or IT, the big company pros are there.

8099,People culture leadership flexibility. The culture In Success Strat NE enables employees to be with their families when needed. Leadership in my experience values employees time and interests. Not only that my experience has been leadership on Sales and Service side have your back in even the toughest situations. Success of the customer is out at the forefront. I have seen this on the Success Mgmt and Sales side and anyone reading this should consider Salesforce as the real deal. Trust is the most important factor here and mostly this is evident throughout. Teaming and “Swarming” on an issue still makes for a great environment. Rarely will you find someone not willing to give you time or jump in for the team. If you want in know your worth. Have solid use cases that show how you provided value to the customer not just leaders who asked you what to do. The most important part is improving our customers experience.
