377,"I have seen many reviews but no action yet. We only see the canned response. Biggest mistake by getting employees and management from Call centre culture. 2. Spoiled the work culture. Most of them doesn’t have knowledge or attitude to work in company like Salesforce. They are fit for BPO only. Salesforce values now changed from Trust to No-Trust. Now the culture is Politics, backstabbing, data manipulation. There was saying Getting into Salesforce is harder than getting into Harvard university. This doesn’t apply for Hyd CSG. Criteria for hyd CSG:- 1. Referred by Management 2. Wife can refer husband and vice-versa. True ohana can be seen here. Husband and wife working in same team, shift, and manager. Though we have policy around it, who cares need to focus on Ohana. If not in same team it’s very easy to work in same shift. Doesn’t make sense reaching out to ES as they are the one who gives offer letters. Promotion criteria:- management favourite. Need to know how to play politics. Backstabbing and how to get numbers. Management is afraid to take actions against non performers and people with wrong attitudes which actually spoiled the entire culture. list will go on..."
417,"It is a very serious job, you have to really embrace it and be prepared to be thoroughly tested. Don't be lulled into a false sense of comfort by the West Coast vibe - sure, there are massive upsides from the amazing culture (especially 'Trust""), but they don't just give jobs away. Decide first: I am going to fully embrace the Salesforce world, if you do, you will find this the most amazing, satisfying company on the planet.to work for."
1000,Sales Management is driven to grow at all costs. Culture of the firm is very positive and philanthropic messages are very positive however the maniacal need to grow 50% y/y puts customer success in second position over deal completion. The growth messages are coupled with sales culture that is not long term relationship (Trusted Advisor) messaging that the overall company convey's to the market.
1107,Working for Salesforce and lack of company Trust.
2689,The company lacks integrity. Trust is a marketing term.
4857,"If you're a Software Engineer looking to learn new technologies, create innovative technical solutions, or grow your career, I cannot stress to you enough to RUN AWAY from any opportunities at Salesforce Indy. The company culture would have you believe that Security/Trust trumps everything. Development machines are tightly locked down, and access to new technologies requires a multi-level approval process that can take months. While Security teams claim to ""partner"" with engineering teams, they impose security restrictions without any input from engineering and require layers of ""evidence"" as to why a restriction should be lifted (we're talking simple things like installing Docker). I was once told that ""Powershell is banned, access to it is completely forbidden"". Furthermore, the company claims to be Agile and is anything but. This is typical for large companies with internal software teams, but frankly I expected more from a company like Salesforce. User stores and bugs are tied back to epics that are ""committed"" to specific releases. They require stories that tie back outlining the project from start to finish, and individual stories are broken down further into ""tasks"" that really just lead to a tedious ""check the box"" workflow for most projects. If for some reason the project doesn't make it in the committed epic, prepare to be asked by multiple layers of management as to why it was dropped/delayed. If you're a developer looking for a 9-5 gig with the best benefits in town and an easy-going atmosphere, this might be for you. If you're a developer that wants to work with newer technologies and create truly innovative solutions to existing problems, look elsewhere. This job will not help you develop a better skillset, it will not help you work with newer tech, and it certainly won't allow you to come anywhere close to creating innovative solutions."

5148,"This was the worst job I've ever had. Management talks down to you like I haven't been doing this for 10 years (and my boss has less experience with half the success).... And I was #1 on my team and #11 in the country. They claim compensation is great but when based in Atlanta you get the most bottom of the barrel accounts and this means everything (you have to deal with it). I've never worked so hard for a $2K deal... in. my. life. In my previous life, I never glimpsed at anything under $100K. That was for newer reps. If you sell a $100K deal, you will be at the top for the month and everyone freaks out. So what this means.... what they say you will get paid is a FAR stretch from reality. I was above my number and didn't make what they claimed because when I got my sales compensation package there are all these other factors. Therefore, I made SIGNIFICANTLY less here than my last job. The base was higher but that was it. I'm a hunter and have always been one. Here, it does NOT make sense to focus on hunting because you get new accounts every year and for a prospect to switch CRM's this decision isn't made overnight. Don't let the recruiter tell you otherwise. Trust me. Every current client that I did get, I had to do damage control from previous reps trying to squeeze every dollar out of them. The previous sales reps had their own agenda and it really hurt our clients. Because you get new accounts each year, the previous reps didn't care about the future. They did whatever it took to get $ and then dumped the client. I spent the first 6 months trying to get our clients not to leave us. The office is LOUD because the desk are on top of each other with no sound barriers and all the conference rooms are booked. Clients made many comments about the background noise and it's embarrassing."
5392,"This review is for recruiters hyd team. There were so many worst experiences with them. Trust and Transparency is the great qualities of the Salesforce. But it seems the recruiters don't care at all. Even though referred so many people, Not sure what's the problem, They never got the call for interview. Also, another experience with them, Some of the recruiters at least don't response to the pings when we ping to them for information, Even after pinging so many times. If they don't respond at least to the internal employees, not sure how they interact with the interview candidates. This is very disappointing how they treat internal employees and at least they should respond. I understand ping people are busy some days or times. But not 2/7 or week. Honestly the recruiter experience is worst experience, They don't care at all. They don't respect time and they don't respect individuals and don't reply to at least internal employees. Also I had heard so many that, Even after candidates performed well, Finally the result is the candidates were rejected."
5957,Trust - Don't believe what they promise you. They won't keep their word Focus has shifted from how to care for employees and customers to how to make more money It's Oracle with a better PR department. Expect layoffs every quarter
6056,"From the technology/infrastructure perspective, ""Trust"" (their word for security) seems to overrule anything else -- it gets in the way of work."

7358,"Salesforce is a great company, But not the Hyderabad support management. Especially the Hyderabad APAC MC premier Management. There are so many unethical things happening. Trust and equality are one of the core values of Salesforce, But it seems APAC MC premier Management doesn't care these core values. There is no equality shown in terms of work, The management shows partiality and allow their favourites to take easy case/work they want and put pressures on others."

8099,Strat is a high stakes game and not for the faint at heart. Expect to deal with challenges and adversity. This is almost not a con as I would expect anyone coming into this role to know how to deal with this and succeed. There can be politics across Sales and Success. However using one of the key pillers of Trust and maintain transparency and you can weather the storm.
8155,"Too many products can cause internal sales challenges and creates a shark tank like environment. Trust is listed as #1 value; in my experience, company values ACV more than trust. Don't expect to hit your number and have work / life balance."
8232,Many in leadership positions have no business being in leadership positions. Company is growing so fast that they’re promoting people to fill seats rather than evaluate them as a leader. “Ohana” culture seems to be a facade. Trust is an issue as I was misled during interview process and have been since I’ve become an employee.
8812,"I was debating whether to post this because I know it won't make a difference. But in the end, I decide to post this because I feel the need to share what we went through. Last month, Salesforce laid off a good number of customer success group members, including myself. I don't know the exact % or number, but it is not a small percentage. People will likely think I am negative toward the company because I got layoff. And you are right, who wouldn't be. Over the years, I truly believe in Salesforce and put lots of heart and soul into the company. This sudden layout is not fun and now gave me lots of uncertainty about my career and how do I support my family going forward. Salesforce talked a lot about Trust and Ohana, but this move killed both ideas for me. Where is the Trust when Salesforce let us go when the company is doing well and continue to hire many other roles. Where is the Ohana when Salesforce management cares purely about the books than the well being of the employee. Salesforce will say they are assisting those of us impacted to find another role internally. But the reality is there is little help, we are on our own to find a new position. There are some great people internally trying to help, but they are doing it on their own and not because Salesforce management asked them to. Many other hiring managers wouldn't even give us the chance or response to us. I do not blame other Salesforce Ohana not sensitive to what happened to us, it didn't happen to them, so they do not feel our pain. The bottom line is Salesforce put the books over employees which is the opposite of everything Salesforce stand for and claim to be.."
