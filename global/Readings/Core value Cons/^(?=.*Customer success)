And this is getting worse as all management layers feel the need to “contribute”.. - Customer success has changed to customer second; this is confirmed as common view in recent employee survey. It’s all about running the revenue up, on cost of some customers being outright screwed over under time pressure from us. It’s terrible to see this change, having been following this great company for many years. - You get promoted by making your numbers. You can be as disrespectful to Salesforce values as you wish to be, as far as the numbers are on the board. This is not a nice environment to work in. This is a shark tank.. - We are taught to be hustlers. We make stories of how great the prices are in certain month and how my manager has a budget for the extra discounts He would like to spend with you as a special customer. Big news: the discounts are always available for those willing to actually buy and there are no budgets for “special discounts”.. The only big diversion from this is January, when it truly is a buyers market. - It is high pressure, always. - Office is too full, and no home office allowed. - Ohana, trust, customer success - these are just words in Sales slides."

8558,"Out of necessity of scale and quickly assimilating acquired Companies, Salesforce applies a standardized performance measurement for it's sales teams across all lines of business. Unfortunately, this approach doesn't always accurately reflect acquired offerings success. In our case as an acquired Company, the bookings nuance negatively skewed performance reviews, merit increase, equity refresh etc. for our acquired staff post integration which reduced motivation & caused unnecessary attrition. General under investment in post sales/Customer success."
