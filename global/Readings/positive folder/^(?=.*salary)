964,"I've been at Salesforce for several years now after coming from one of the big 4 consulting firms, and it's been night and day! Although I was a top performer at my previous company, it was clear that I was disposable to them regardless and they would rather hire someone with less experience than try to retain me (my requests were not related to salary, but changes to projects and overall happiness). I provided a lot of feedback on how to improve processes and promote collaborative culture as other coworkers were feeling similarly, but nothing was done. At Salesforce, I completely feel as if I'm heard by management. I've transferred to several different teams with ease (in fact, after one year at the company they encourage it and create programs to shadow other roles). My managers are genuinely interested in progressing my career and enabling me to succeed and I've enjoyed working with all the teams I've been on. I've had a lot of flexibility to ensure I still have a nice work/life balance and that I actually get to use all the perks available! I personally use all of the $100 gym membership stipend (you can use it for massages too if you don't work out!) and the generous VTO balance (56 hours to volunteer at my local animal shelter, yes please!)."

1297,"In my first 30 days this journey at Salesforce has been nothing short of inspiring! I have been in the workforce over 35 years, working for corporate America, small companies and large tech companies as well.

I find something new everyday that makes Salesforce a great place to work. I used to think Google or Twitter were the pinnacle of tech, but after having had opportunities at both, I couldn't imagine why anyone would work anywhere else but Salesforce."
2651,"The role is as expected. It allows for experimentation in process and areas for improvement, while considering the historical context of why something is the way it is. Being entirely remote (because of COVID) since beginning, there is good work/life balance. The company has given WFH Stipends for employees and has excellent communication in the form of All Hands meetings (very frequent) and email communications. I feel respected for my experience, and not pressured on my performance. We are all in the same boat, so we all have essentially similar expectations. The pay is good, as are the benefits (I expect would be better if work was in person). From what I understand, the promotion and salary reconsideration processes are fair and equitable."

The culture of volunteerism and giving back is in the fabric of the company and is something that is almost mandated that people do in their communities in ways that they think is best and fulfills their passion to give back.

6002,"Salesforce is a great place to work, for a lot of people a lot of the time. My perspective is mostly from consulting services/CSG, but there are some things that apply across the board. -Excellent focus on work/life balance. Better than anywhere else I've found in terms of consulting or engineering jobs. -Excellent salary. My title maps to ""senior manager"" level as an individual contributor, and all things considered I am extremely satisfied with it. -Health insurance is excellent, in terms of coverage/cost/options. One of the better plans I've seen. -401(k) is excellent if you're an investing wonk. The match tops out at $5k which is middle-of-the-pack, and the plan is through Fidelity (meh) with which you get a good selection of funds, but more importantly, BrokerageLink to invest in the wider markets, and the ability to contribute after-tax beyond the 402(g) limit and auto-convert to Roth with 1 phone call to set this up. This is relatively new in the marketplace, and still rare. Tl;dr is you can contribute as much as $52,000 to your plan for 2020 and characterize as Roth in the end, not $19,500, regardless of your age (research ""Mega Backdoor Roth""), which is a huge benefit for financial planning for highly-compensated employees. -Working for Salesforce comes with a lot of cachet within the world of software vendors and partners, and access to awesome tools and information. If you've been a consultant or worked for an ISV and geek out to the product, you're going to love it here, and often be able to get involved with really interesting clients, projects, and internal initiatives shaping future product development."

Reimburse 3.5L per year of tuition in case you want to pursue continued education outside! LOTS of holidays! Free amazing unlimited food and drinks 24X7X365. Also did I mention they provide an iPhone and MacBook to EVERY employee along with unlimited 4G internet connection?! The office has a mindfulness room to practice meditation, space for nursing mothers, board games, Pingpong tables, air hockey tables among other things Culture: Colleagues are warm and friendly. I have barely finished a week here and I already have friends and plans made for a movie, team lunch and weekend! Everyone is helpful, non judgemental and open. As I work in a global team with my colleagues across the world, the diversity is mind blowing. One of my colleagues is an actor in movies, the other one has travelled to 29 countries, my super boss was a part of a very famous American TV show in her young days!! There is lot of stress on wellness and being fit with bike month, running challenges as well as on giving back to the society with fun team volunteering events right from Day1. As a leading technology company, the systems are integrated with a SSO and user friendly Career and Development: They stress on developing careers right from Day1. There are many trainings conducted, articles on their blogs and trails(online learning). Also the networking opportunities are immense. It's great to work with the smartest people with diverse backgrounds and learn from each other. Also they have a fun themed office space with cute mascots printed on walls, furniture and just about everywhere! The events I have been told are larger than life and the office space is exactly the same across the globe to make employees feel good! Very thoughtful I must say"
