1069,"I've been in high tech for over 20 years, including 12 at Oracle. Salesforce is by far the best place I have ever worked. Here's why: * Awesome people * Surrounded by top talent * Great collaborative vibe * Highly supportive * 1:1:1 is really cool (% equity, profits, time). You get paid volunteer time. Not just lip service. Salesforce really gives back. * Lots of support & resources to help you succeed * Fun atmosphere * Real career development\path —within teams or moving into different roles * Cult-like devotion all around from employees to users to partners * Impressive on-boarding process —they do it right."
1469,"- Potential to make a lot of money at a really young age because of the excellent comp structure and stock options - Amazing benefits and Covid-19 period really showed how the company truly cares for it's employees - Great culture with focus on equality, encouraging employees to give back and focus on wellness"
1683,"It's a wonderful company to work for, the culture and values are the at the highest priority of the company's leaders. You really feel that your manager and the company it self cares about you and your wellbeing. You can really see that employees are really passionate about their role and Salesforce."
1861,"I have been with Salesforce for 6 years and am so impressed with the direction and way the company has been growing. The sense of belonging is really here as the leadership really makes sure each employee is taken care of. With the recent climate of Covid-19, I truly saw how much Salesforce valued each employee and prioritized each and every one of our health. The company has grown 4x the size since I started and it's a great feeling to contribute to the growth. The benefits here are amazing as well. My favorites are the wellness reimbursement program, ESPP and 401k."
1961,"The benefits and culture are fantastic. Overall, you can tell people like working here which makes for a nice atmosphere. They seem to really care about the well-being of their employees so the benefits are great and there are many programs, groups and channels to get help and have fun."
2003,Great Company that really cares about culture and employees. The ecosystem is big which helps
2229,"Salesforce is seriously a dream job. There are endless growth opportunities and an amazing support system here. The managers (and even the Executive Leadership) are really engaged and transparent. I appreciate the generous paid volunteer time off and encouragement to give back to our communities. That goes without saying that the benefits are also really competitive. The company truly INVESTS in its employees. You have opportunities to learn and make yourself more competitive not just internally but in the greater marketplace. Everyone wants you to succeed. Marc Benioff is an incredible CEO and such an anomaly in Silicon Valley. I've never witnessed a CEO that seems so in touch with the world around them. He's so approachable and truly cares about the greater impact that Salesforce has on the communities it serves. His investment in the environment is one of the things that really drew me to Salesforce, specifically the Benioff Ocean Initiative. He's not just another talking head in Silicon Valley."
2586,"This company is growing and has rightfully earned many accolades. The benefits are fantastic, and you'll earn a lot of money if you're smart, motivated, and get things done. One key piece of advice that I have is to be proactive about your career. It can be tempting to code all day long, but you'll need to take a step back every now and then to chart your course over the next several releases to get ahead and stay in control of your career. If you don't, then others may put you into a direction that you might not like. Take charge and make your case to others, and resources will flow to you if others agree with your vision. That actually ties in well with my next point. Every year, each of us must create a ""V2MOM,"" which is Marc Benioff's method of distilling down what you want to do over the next year from both a high level and from a detailed level. You start off with a single vision, list your values, determine the methods that will realize your vision, identify the obstacles that may prevent you from realizing your vision, and create metrics that can measure how you know when you've realized your vision. Many people secretly blow it off and just copy their managers' V2MOMs, but if used properly, it really can make a difference in your own career. As one of the leaders had said, you get from it what you put into it. If you really embrace and use the V2MOM, you'll go far both at work and in life. The culture increasingly uses the V2MOM in its decision making and resource allocations. But don't worry; it's not a cult or anything remotely like that. Salesforce.com invests heavily in its employees. From the high-end office space to comfortable interiors, generous benefits, and firm commitment to meeting and exceeding workplace fairness, policy, and procedure rules and laws, anyone can be free to be themselves at Salesforce.com and do the best work of their lives. I know I am :). I'm an openly gay male, and that has never been held against me (as far as I'm aware, at least)."

3208,"1. Management really cares about each and every employee 2. Really great projects to work for, should have good skills 3. Very employee-friendly, you will get everything you need from wellness(up to 60k/year) to education reimbursement (up to 3.5 lakhs with manager approval) 4. Office is no less than a 5 star hotel with free food and cool mascots"
3269,"- Great benefits (i.e. Insurance, Wellness Reimbursement, Snacks, etc.) - They care about the happiness and wellbeing of their employees - No internal meetings on Friday noons which may be a good thing for external-facing roles like AEs to minimize distractions - Some of the managers can be really good and try to create psychologically safe team environment"
3482,Great benefits and they really take care of their employees
3554,Salesforce is a great place to work if you’re looking for work life balance! You’re encouraged to prioritize mental health and well-being in general. They’re flexible about remote work and if you need to work weird hours due to child care etc. This probably varies a bit from team to team but generally they really encourage employees to be humans first.
3582,"Salesforce has a really solid business model, with a subscription-based approach to software that was revolutionary when it was first introduced 23 years ago. This subscription-based approach means that ongoing revenue can be relied on, for all customers that remain with the company. Since the attrition, or the loss of customers, is very low, this means that the cash flow for this business is very reliable and predictable over the long term. The company really strives to gain the trust and to ensure that customers are successful. These happy customers then become highly referenceable, and recommend our solution for others. Our product has become such a vital part of their business that it is also very sticky over the long term. As our company continues to acquire new capabilities, our solution becomes even more enticing and relevant, since we can address and integrate a broad cross-section of the needs of each of our customers (Marketing, Sales, Commerce, Service, Analytics). We deliver a comprehensive enterprise software solution, which is cohesive and integrated in ways that no other company can provide. In addition to this, we constantly think of ways to innovate and make our customers lives easier. We are able to digitize and improve the efficiency of a broad cross-section of enterprises out there who do not focus on digital solutions as their core business. All of these factors together represent a very strong opportunity for continued growth of this business. Salesforce has also been executing really well on surmounting many of the more difficult technical challenges that they faced due to the fact that the product is based on legacy code. There is technical debt related to the database, also there is a major migration underway to move to the public cloud. The company has executed incredibly well on these and many other challenges internally. The culture is incomparable. The leadership of the company have a genuine concern for each employee, and a real investment in doing the right thing for the community. The company takes a leading role in helping to champion initiatives that address homelessness and environmental issues for example. We also are really committed to the success of all of our stakeholders, including employees, customers, partners, communities, and all of the trailblazers who form the broader salesforce community. The ecosystem of administrators, architects and developers who are part of our space has continued to grow, and the company is also really proactive in helping to develop the skills of those people that might be interested in growing a career with our products."
3794,"This is my 6 months of employment review. I am surrounded by strong women who are amazing team Leaders and workers. Management is fair and cares a lot. I'm not the best employee. I would consider myself incredibly average. I do feel that this is the first time in my career that my skills are accurately rated. I am given the opportunity to as they say ""level up"" with very detailed one on ones. This model only works for those who want to be better engineers and customer service agents. I never feel as if my caseload is too much. in fact, I have the free time to help my team reach resolutions and educate myself on my product. I really hope to retire here Before this, I owned my own business, and before that, I was a contract IT. I rather eat a whole brick house than work at any other company."

4311,"Great company, really value employees and care about mental health/wellness"
4326,Excellent work structure. Company provides you with 90 days for Onboarding Process. Great values and really care for their employees.
4356,"Feel like I am part of a team and a family even though I work remotely. Great pay, great benefits, interesting work. Seem to really care about employee success and growth."
4383,"Great people pretty much across the board, laid back (for the most part), really care about employee well being. Direct managers are very supportive, pay is good (but not as great as you might expect), benefits are good, flexible on remote vs in office."
4449,Leadership truly cares about the employees. The FTO model actually works here and employees are encouraged to take time for themselves without guilt. Since going to a distributed model it has been even easier to integrate your life with work. It's not really a work/life balance anymore since you can do life things while working and vice-versa!
4510,"Great values and culture, really care and listen to the employees, willing to change and adapt."
4681,Very smart people. 111 foundation. Marc (CEO) really cares for employees and customers.
4739,"- C-Level Management cares for employees. - Employee success is really good. - There are some genuinely talented people who can help you learn. - If you get on a good team (which is a stroke of luck), you might have some good projects to work on. - Good brand name & external perception. - Depending on team and your abilities to talk in badly run meetings, you may end up experiencing a huge growth."

5189,Best company I have worked for hands down. There are so many opportunities for personal career growth. They really value their employees and want to see them succeed and be happy.
5516,"This is the best software companies that I've worked for during my career as a software QA. I like the fact that everyone is very open to suggestions and ideas, management is willing to listen to you and help you advance your careers, and promotions do happen often as well as bonuses. They have great benefits and they are willing to offer you commute benefits to cut down your commute costs. I think this company treats their employees really well. QA are especially very well respected within the R&D unlike other software companies where QA doesn't have much of a say in big decisions. QA gets to be involved with the design early on, gets to automate and improve your technical skills. Also they allow you the flexibility to switch teams if you'd like to work on different teams."

6200,"My first few months with Salesforce is good. I've worked in the field for 10 years and been at companies ranging form large corporations to a small startup. I read some of the one star reviews and think people might have different experiences on different teams or people just have different expectations. As for my own experience, compared to the companies I worked for in the past, Salesforce is a good company to work for. It offers above market salaries but also asks you to work hard for it. No doubt the amount of things to learn at the beginning is overwhelming. Luckily new employees are offered plenty of formal training classes. Everyone on the team is ready to help, too, because they got tons to do and really want you to be able to contribute. The company is growing fast so politics might get worse. But don't kid yourself. Wherever there are people, there is politics. I once worked at a 50 employee startup and had to deal with the constant BS going on in the office. Find a good manager who can shield you from a lot of this if you are a technical minded person. And the company allows you to jump between opportunities if you don't really like your current team and/or manager and they can't hold you back. My previous job was at a large software company, where an internal transfer took at least a few months...an offer letter can take up to 6 months for it to go up the management chain and get a headcount...the quality of software was a mess because the management only cares about metrics and spreadsheets and no idea what they were building. So far I haven't seen the same problems at Salesforce. The scrum teams are very small and agile. They do expect you to do real work very quick but working 10-12 hour shifts is not typical."
6273,"Pay is great. But the stock options and bonuses serve as a gilded whip to hold over employee's heads. If you put aside your better technical judgements as an engineer you'll get along fine here. If you're able to juggle being harassed by a co-worker every five minutes on IM, e-mail or phone and can still get productive work done, you may like it here. You'll learn about about Agile development and how it can really work - in spite of the fact that group managers ignore the great recommendations of the agile training team. During your first few weeks, do some careful analysis on the source code you'll be working with. There's a sense at the company's that it's somehow infallible and should not be questioned. If you disagree with that view on solid technical grounds, you'll be able to quickly determine whether or not you want to stay on. So, that transparency is a good thing. The software release process and software upgrade process is good. So, you'll learn a lot about that. Training is pretty good, but corporate policy has many self-conflicting points."
6454,- This company truly cares about it's customers/employees and it is clear from day 1. It really does feel like a huge family. - Tech stack is with the times and presents lots of opportunities for growth. - Open communication is heavily encouraged.
6567,"The benefits and culture are fantastic. Overall, you can tell people like working here which makes for a nice atmosphere. They seem to really care about the well-being of their employees so the benefits are great and there are many programs, groups and channels to get help and have fun."
6602,"* Awesome benefits * Home-like feeling even though it's a major corporate * As an employee, you really feel important and cared for"
6766,"Salesforces really knows how to take care of their employees. They are passionate about taking care of their customers. Great culture, company is growing and there are opportunities for career changes."
6797,"Pardot at the early acquisition phase was a fun start-up martech vibe culture. Adam Blitzer was a great leader before and after he sold Pardot to Salesforce. The commissions paid monthly were good, employee discounts with the likes of Apple, movie vouchers, free drinks, fruit and snacks and healthcare benefits for you and your family especially in those unexpected incidents is just outstanding. The leadership that came from Atlanta was very charismatic. I recall times when the VO Sales would jump on a call with a prospect at the 11th hour remotely at the oddest time to help regional teams. Who does that? It’s things this you will always remember. In terms of people, when you find a core group of individuals whom you trust and can lean of for advise and support, it goes a really long way in otherwise a very demanding role"
6806,They really care about his employees. Ohana Philosophy I think It's terrific.
6837,"The culture inside the company is like a family. Everyone is willing to help those who need help on any issue or challenge. It's a non discriminatory environment open to people from all countries, religions, sex and color. The company really cares about what people can do instead of how they look or where they come from. Salesforce encourages career development and progression, investing a lot on helping employees to follow a development path"
6847,"1:1:1 model - employees are encouraged to take time to give back, even being given 6 days per year to take for this. Competitive salary #ohana culture - you really feel like part of something, and the organisation truly cares about its staff Innovation - it's easy to feel proud to work for a company who is the pioneer for what they do. Career development - you can have an entire career within the organisation, lots of roles and flexibility to move around."
6869,"Salesforces really knows how to take care of their employees. They are passionate about taking care of their customers. Great culture, company is growing and there are opportunities for career changes."
6873,"1. VTO - Voluntary Time Out - I was skeptical about this before joining, but I am so happy and proud that Salesforce encourages and facilitates voluntary activity among employees. The act of giving back is indeed there. 2. Smart people, It feels great to be surrounded by people who are smarter than you. 3. Very flexible working style and support work-life balance. 4. Competitive pay with amazing benefits and perks. My favorites are wellness and education reimbursement. 5. Work quality is good, got to work on some really cool products. 6. They encourage you to control your own career in fact you can transfer to other teams for an opportunity if you fit the bill. 7. The V2MOM process is their USP, I was surprised to see the leadership is living and breathing it and use it to bring alignment across teams. 8. They encourage employee well being, provide food, liberal leave policy includes paternal leave policy."
6891,"Gym allowance, health insurance, volunteering time, education allowance, working with incredible people and the freedom to innovate, incredible career mobility, and a CEO that really seems to care for his employees"
7019,"* Awesome benefits * Home-like feeling even though it's a major corporate * As an employee, you really feel important and cared for"
7256,"-The people, once you get set up and find your tribe (which you will) then the people are awesome - folks will always give you time, feedback, advice, coaching etc... -I have had lots of opportunities to try new things -Good salary and Great benefits (hello 12 weeks pat leave!) - historically I would have said the company genuinely cared for each employee and would have a stake in each employee's success. I guess with huge growth that has to dilute... still a great place to be... but not as great as it was (hoping with offices reopening that will change back) - equality and diversity - I feel that compared to most big corps - we do Equality and diversity pretty well and there is real momentum and backing and finance to keep doing better. - I really believe that the leadership and rest of the business want to do business the right way."
7403,Great WLB and ethics cares about employees Colleagues are really great Non toxic and great culture
7494,"-The core values of Salesforce really show in the day-to-day, making you truly feel valued as an employee -Wonderful management who cares about your future, consistently having career projection conversations"
7623,"I think in my life dealing with 50+ more companies recruiters, Salesforce recruiters are the worst. They have reached out to me through linkedin asking for updated resume and once they get hold of it they disappear. I try reaching out to them asking for updates for never hear back from them. Mind you, I work in FANG and this has happened to me atleast 4 times now. The only reason I am interested in this company is because I happened to speak to few managers and looks like they really care about their employees. Sadly, the recruiters dont!"
7799,* Good pay. * Excellent coworkers. * Company really cares about it's employees. * Volunteering is encouraged.
7862,"Excellent work/life balance for engineers. Although there are inevitably occasional moments of mayhem, you will rarely need to work more than 8 hours per day. Excellent company vision. The whole philanthropy thing may seem overblown, or like it's just for show, but after seeing it from the inside, I am fully convinced that the leadership really does have a genuine interest in doing good for humanity. You will learn a lot, and still have plenty of time for your own personal life. The company genuinely respects their employees and looks after them. You really feel like they want to take care of you and they view you as a human being, not just a tool for their success. Customers genuinely love the product. CEO is a genuine visionary and philanthropist."
8560,It is the best company I worked for as it really lives its values. They take amazing care of their employees.
8822,"Salesforce is literally the best company I have worked for in my career. I work alongside smart people and am challenged every day in my role. We are consistently growing at Salesforce, at about 30% year-over-year and there's a ton of opportunity to continue to grow and develop my career here. The company has a huge heart and giving back is baked into the company DNA. We have the 1:1:1 philanthropy model and our employees receive 7 paid volunteer days annually which we are encouraged to use. Mindfulness and wellness are always promoted within the organization. The kitchen here is fully stocked with yummy, healthy snacks, beverages and great coffee. The collaboration is phenomenal here and I have found that if you ask for help or advice people are always very warm and willing to give their assistance. The company has won every award under the sun for both their business solutions and employee engagement and being an employee here you can really understand why. #DreamJob is for real."
8848,"- They really do take care of the employees. Each and everyone of us. - A lot of motivation from managers and team mates in achieving goals - It is much more than just a job - The knowledge gained is not comparable to any other organisation - Considerate colleagues - Amazing breakfast and lunch provided, everyday with a different cuisine buffet - A great Social Lounge and game room that allows you to unwind"

9102,Very good company to work for. I really much enjoyed the experience having learned so much and developed myself. I do love working at Salesforce. The company culture is great and the company has amazing products. Work-life balance at Salesforce is some of the best I've personally experienced. Company truly cares about their employees by offering a well-being reimbursement and good PTO time.
9667,I joined Salesforce about 5 years ago. Never looked back. Love the company culture and that they really care about their employees. Plenty of opportunities to grow and switch up what you're working on. Upper management is transparent and shares where they are taking the company and why.
9716,"I know not all middle managers at Salesforce are like this, but my manager really puts his employees first. There's a lot of trust in employees to do the right thing, which means greater trust for things like work-life balance, work from home, etc. The top leaders really do care about the things they talk about as well which is great."
