It sounds cliche, but the people here are really what made me choose SalesforceIQ. Everyone is social, intelligent, and extremely helpful. Onboarding has been smooth and the development pace is much faster than what you'd find in a traditional tech company. You get the best of both worlds within SalesforceIQ - a startup environment that has the stability of a large company. Compensation is highly competitive with the bay area. SalesforceIQ was definitely one of the best choice I've made."

885,"Coming into the summer with a couple different work experiences, SalesforceIQ provided one of the best internship experiences anyone could ask for. Emphasizing their values, it was evident that they placed a high importance on their people. The people at SalesforceIQ are some of the brightest, hard working and friendliest people you can work with. In a fast pace environment, interns are given the same responsibilities as full time employees - making you feel part of the team and contributing to the product. As an intern, not only do you get great experiences with other interns, but executives make time to interact with you and make sure you are invested in your few months as part of the company. This past summer was an internship I will never forget."
888,"The foundation of why SteelBrick was a great place to work still exists in small amounts; great employees, caring and friendly environment, opportunities to move your career forward, etc. - Salesforce has brought on some nice benefits like Volunteer Time Off (VTO), and access to more resources about the SFDC ecosystem that we already lived in as a separate company. So it's been great for employees who were already passionate about this space. -Working at Salesforce now has opened doors to try out new roles in other teams and transfer internally. -Non-sales SteelBrick employees work out of a nice building in SF with great perks; free catered lunches, on-site gym, yoga classes, meditation, etc. Sales team works out of HQ SF office and enjoys being closer to core AE's."

The company embodies a number of values, which they teach you within the first few months of being here among them include fun, innovation, wellness, and giving back. Those were the values that really drove me to accept Salesforce's offer over other companies. They truly integrate these values into their day-to-day operations. They offer generous VTO, and they genuinely encourage you to use them. Great perks, decent benefits & pay, and all-around amazing peers to work alongside. If you're considering joining as a new graduate, I'd highly encourage it. It's a fast moving environment, but you'll learn so much and it'll be a great addition to your career journey."

I feel energized every day to want to do a great job for the company and our customers. If you are looking for more than just a job, Salesforce is the place to be!"
1003,"Seriously a phenomenal culture and place to work all around. Employees are being spoiled by Salesforce and in turn are given way more employee perks (housing/travel stipend, regular events, ect), and are in an environment where employees have amazing opportunities for growth in their careers and abilities. The engineering culture is open and employees are often encouraged to teach others their expertise. The team is impressive and talented, and for the most part, the only people that have ever left the company have only done so to go start their own companies."

Everything from Trailhead (an online learning resource), to one's team members, employee success, and documented policies and procedures all allow for new employees to learn their new role and easily transition to the company. Employee benefits are wonderful and it's very clear Salesforce puts employees first. There's even food in ever break room so no one ever has to sit at work hungry. All employees are given VTO, which is time off to volunteer for whatever charitable cause they choose. Salesforce also matches charitable donations up to a certain amount. Overall this is an amazing employee focused company. In addition to being a company that takes care of employees, Salesforce also takes care of the community and encourages employees to do the same."

Much easier to match your portfolio in other accounts. This is important to long-term employees. Frequent sponsored lunches.

1269,"Culture wise this is one of the best companies I have ever worked for. The people are great and their is a real team environment. People really want to help and do the best for the team and the customer. I've never seen another company close to this. Salesforce also follows a model that donates 1% of revenue, 1% of time and 1% of product to charity. As an employee, I get 5 days of Volunteer Time Off and charitable donation matches. It's also super easy for me as an employee to get that match and log VTO time. Salesforce is setting the bar in this space along with Patagonia. Salesforce is also trying to be sustainable and is a carbon-neutral cloud. . No other company can say that. Compensation aside this company is a 7 on a scale of 1-5."

The managers (and even the Executive Leadership) are really engaged and transparent. I appreciate the generous paid volunteer time off and encouragement to give back to our communities. That goes without saying that the benefits are also really competitive. The company truly INVESTS in its employees. You have opportunities to learn and make yourself more competitive not just internally but in the greater marketplace. Everyone wants you to succeed. Marc Benioff is an incredible CEO and such an anomaly in Silicon Valley. I've never witnessed a CEO that seems so in touch with the world around them. He's so approachable and truly cares about the greater impact that Salesforce has on the communities it serves. His investment in the environment is one of the things that really drew me to Salesforce, specifically the Benioff Ocean Initiative. He's not just another talking head in Silicon Valley."

3538,"Joined the company about 6 months ago thinking I understood selling, and how to close business having spent 13 years in various AM & BD roles, but Salesforce takes the art of selling to another level entirely, and gives you the at-bats and the opportunity to succeed at every turn. They truly poured millions into learning and development, with more resources and training you could ask for or find anywhere else. Everyone makes you feel welcomed from the get-go, and there is a true mentality of ""we are in the trenches together"", where everyone is more than willing to help the new folks at the drop of a hat, because they've been there, and they care about their colleagues. It really is impressive. The compensation is lucrative, and the spiffs are insane! The office environment is very casual, and fun. Management, at least my chain of command, are in your corner and helping you whenever they can, and they do not pull punches (which I love), so you always know where you stand with them. They're tough, and so is the job, but more than fair, and highly rewarding."
3544,Salesforce fosters a collaborative environment which encourages employees to bring their authentic selves to work. Employee benefits and resources are excellent.
3582,"Salesforce has a really solid business model, with a subscription-based approach to software that was revolutionary when it was first introduced 23 years ago. This subscription-based approach means that ongoing revenue can be relied on, for all customers that remain with the company. Since the attrition, or the loss of customers, is very low, this means that the cash flow for this business is very reliable and predictable over the long term. The company really strives to gain the trust and to ensure that customers are successful. These happy customers then become highly referenceable, and recommend our solution for others. Our product has become such a vital part of their business that it is also very sticky over the long term. As our company continues to acquire new capabilities, our solution becomes even more enticing and relevant, since we can address and integrate a broad cross-section of the needs of each of our customers (Marketing, Sales, Commerce, Service, Analytics). We deliver a comprehensive enterprise software solution, which is cohesive and integrated in ways that no other company can provide. In addition to this, we constantly think of ways to innovate and make our customers lives easier. We are able to digitize and improve the efficiency of a broad cross-section of enterprises out there who do not focus on digital solutions as their core business. All of these factors together represent a very strong opportunity for continued growth of this business. Salesforce has also been executing really well on surmounting many of the more difficult technical challenges that they faced due to the fact that the product is based on legacy code. There is technical debt related to the database, also there is a major migration underway to move to the public cloud. The company has executed incredibly well on these and many other challenges internally. The culture is incomparable. The leadership of the company have a genuine concern for each employee, and a real investment in doing the right thing for the community. The company takes a leading role in helping to champion initiatives that address homelessness and environmental issues for example. We also are really committed to the success of all of our stakeholders, including employees, customers, partners, communities, and all of the trailblazers who form the broader salesforce community. The ecosystem of administrators, architects and developers who are part of our space has continued to grow, and the company is also really proactive in helping to develop the skills of those people that might be interested in growing a career with our products."

This is aided by the amazing benefits such as healthcare, dental, paid-time-off and volunteer-time-off just to name a few. Management run reports to see where they can help you, not give-out to you. And flexible working is totally supported. You are allowed do what works for you and micro-management does not exist here. - Amazing people. I've never worked with a harder working bunch of people. Generally people shy away from taking on extra work, however here people will volunteer their time just to help you. Everybody wants to help! To add to this, because there's a low attrition rate due to the amazing benefits, working environment and such. You actually have experienced people working there who know what they're talking about. So for new people, it's easy to get assistance and progress. You feel safe with all the knowledgeable people around you. - Very interesting and dynamic product!

I've worked at a number of other software companies and I've never seen anything like it. Career advancement opportunities are everywhere. Although it's a fairly big company now, it's definitely possible to identify opportunities and take them, even from the very bottom rung of the latter, and management actively encourages it. The executives are also top-notch and generally very accessible. These are the people I want to learn from. They know what they're doing."
