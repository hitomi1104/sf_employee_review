96,"Long growth path, very slow Favoritism for promotions Encouraged to work overtime regularly, very demanding job"
272,"There is a real lack of cohesion to the sales organization. When you first join you are pretty left to fend for yourself and see to your own integration. The sales targets are completely ridiculous and the compensation plan has been making it more difficult to make money every year. This year I am going to make approximately €25-40k (depending how my year finishes) less than the average of my last two years. The overall attainment figures for sales people are in the toilet. This will not be made clear during your interview and will not be openly discussed with management as to what a realistic quota should be. This ultimately has created a toxic environment where people feel undervalued due to their inability to hit an unrealistic target. In theory, everyone can make good money. In reality 90% of people will miss their target and the majority of commissions will be left in the hands of the few. The increasing product offering of Salesforce brings problems in terms of collaboration. It is not always easy to find the right person for the right meeting in good time. This can make it difficult for customers to do business with us, as the sales process can become protracted. While career options are varied, the criteria for promotion isn't ever clear. It is often a case of 10 people interviewing not knowing how many roles will be filled, not knowing when they will find out and unclear feedback as to why they did/didn't get the role. Naturally this has caused people to question the process."
330,"Worst management - They will never listen to you. They'll only do what they want to do and all your ideas will be given to others and they are projected as their ideas. Totally biased and even after multiple feedbacks with the proofs they do not want to accept. They will always tell, there's more to come in the future stay tuned. It's not about promotions or hike percentages. It's about ethics and integrity which the management will oversee always. Sometimes it's clearly evident and visible to everyone in the team that something wrong is happening and the local leadership in Hyderabad, never want to fix it. They just want to bypass it saying the (people who get support from management) trying to do something extra why don't you support him instead of giving feedback. Later, the people who actually want to work as a team and share some feedback with the managers will be targeted big time and will be treated as like slaves or even worst them, Support - Worst support that I have seen in the service industry. These guys never understand its a product based support, not a BPO. With Salesforce having three releases a year with all upgradations & patches, it will be difficult for a support person to keep up to date all the time. The worst way of calculation with regards to the headcount. They say they're hiring people but for a quarter 50 people for a backlog and burden of thousands of cases is not working. Outdated metrics are being used to calculate productivity and other year-end calculations. Employee Success or HR: Apart from very few members Zaira Banu & Rajesh I do not see others responding to the questions raised by the employees. I'm not biased towards the above two but however, their work speaks for themselves. Now coming to the recruitment, Salesforce always recommends the employees to refer people to the organisation, however, the recruitment or referral process is worst (there is no other least word for this). I have referred around 10 profiles to this organisation, all the profiles haven't been considered. They stay in the first or second stage for almost 2 to 3 months and then the status changes to No longer in consideration. When we try to contact the recruiter there will be no response. FYI, the above mentioned 10 profiles have been selected in other organisations for better positions and better packages. It's clearly evident on the floor that there is an agreement between the manager and the respective team member. The team member will refer people and the respective manager will select that profile. Once the team member gets the referral bonus it will be shared by the team member(who referred to the profile) and the manager who recruited."
353,"Despite not wanting to acknowledge this fact, Salesforce is an incredibly political company to progress in. There is a heavy process around advancement, the main activity being developing your own brand. This involves gaining sponsors at various levels and promoting yourself (sometimes unashamedly) heavily throughout the business. This 'brand campaigning' is by definition political. It is also biased towards those that have the time to commit to it. It is largely dependant on a full and present management chain and those who are actually fully active making a difference at their customers, or who are under resourced and performing multiple roles to serve their customer, do not get the chance to 'seize the opportunity that Salesforce states that it presents. The result is that the talent in the business feel undervalued and the promotions go to the people who have shouted the loudest. It is a real shame, Salesforce isn't the company that I wanted it to be."
371,"From the Professional Services Department point of view, there is a lack of opportunities for internal promotions as the management seems to prefer hiring externally most of the time rather than giving a chance to employees that have been developing very hard themselves for the next opportunity; lack of support for professional development with a significant slow down in investing in external trainings and certifications; a lack of transparency towards the consultants that get updated at the last minute about internal changes; quite some room for improvement with regards to resource management as consultants are unclear on what they are meant to be working a week ahead or in terms of priorities and are demanded to do the extra mile every mile; and finally buggy new products that take several years to get almost fixed"
381,"- Sometimes seems like a company where you'd be better off joining after a few years elsewhere, rather than kicking off your career due to what seems like unfair promotions"
410,"- Despite what is promised repeatedly, there is no real possibility to change department when you're in a career path, especially in sales. - Very high pressure and targets in Sales - CONSTANTLY monitored: Salesforce is the leader in cloud CRM and knows very well how to use its tools to control its employees every single activity and everyday actions, can be quite annoying at times - Uneven between markets: mature markets have a very easy life compared to less matured markets (in monthly targets, promotion criteria, visibility within company, etc.)"
678,"- mostly work at the office instead of work from home - territories get shuffled frequently based on fiscal year, promotions, etc. it would be great if there's consistency with the territory, it's challenging to build your region only to be plucked from your patch the next round of territory adjustments - nothing else at this time"
731,"A bunch of Oracle execs were hired over the last 3 years, and they have been busy replicating the Oracle culture here. The worst changes to the company have come in at the beginning of 2015. Quality Engineering was de-prioritized across the R&D organization. Many of the QE execs have been given different roles (I am not complaining about this. To be fair, many of these so-called QE execs should be fired. Do we really need 10 VPs in Quality Engineering? QE heads are now reporting to development managers. The road ahead points to converting all teams to Engineering teams. So if you are a QE trying to get a job, look elsewhere. Do not listen to the drivel from the recruiters. QE ROLE IS ENDING AT SALESFORCE! Added to this, the conflicting priorities are ever increasing in this company. R&D is at its 3rd attempt to re-write the UI, and make it adaptive at the same time. The so-called Salesforce 1 app was a disaster. The next attempt is starting in 2015. Although there is not a lot of hope for it, many of the ""leaders"" driving this will surely make hay via promotions and stock grants."
863,"Unrealistic quota goals. Every single month feels like it's end of quarter, and end of quarters feel like end of year. End of year is just insane. The pressure every single month is tough to deal with and especially in ESMB, quotas are just not realistic. Big deals tough to come by. You'd expect a sales role at Salesforce to have plenty of inbound leads or plenty of add on business for existing customers - really not the case. Ton of outbound, cold calling, hunting role (but in your limited account base of course). Be ready to have literally everything questioned and expected to tell your manager absolutely everything going on in any deal at all times. You'll be questioned on everything you do. The culture in the NYC office is nothing like the other offices. When there are events or happy hours, everyone is too busy or exhausted to even go. Very much a heads down and focus kind of atmosphere. Path to promotion is VERY political. Be prepared to play the game to move up."
1028,Hiring and promotion decisions are at times perplexing. Senior leadership seems disconnected from the masses. The organization is getting big - HR needs to be more involved and influence more.
1030,"-long turnaround for promotions, at times can be out of your control"
1214,The Chicago office is a boys club. Lots of senior sales leaders/VP’s got away with inappropriate behavior for a long time due to lack of HR presence in the office. Very political and promotions are a popularity contest. Also needs more racial and gender diversity-much improved but still a long way to go.
1234,Sometimes the promotions are questionable. The process is 100% questionable - but this is a big initiative from our CMO - to offer more visibility into this.
1267,"- Unsure how promotions are decided upon, would like to see performance & peer reviews used to help decide promotions. - Lots of growth, change is constant and makes it difficult to get things done sometimes."
1616,- Big company so some internal processes might be a bit slow - Career path is sometimes unclear and you need to create your network to land the best role / promotion. This is not always given to you just based on merit.
1636,"Constant changes in both leadership and patch Accounts changes every year and if you are given a bad patch there is no understanding that the numbers may be low due to that Forget about a promotion if you dont hit your numbers, they would even hire an outsider then you if they have similar experience Its a cold call hell where you are suppose to bring in new logos all the time from a patch with ""potential""350 prospects and the data in the patch is bad. Some companies went bankrupt years ago and are still in there Maybe its bettet on other segments but SMB its not to recommend This is for the Dublin office"
1918,- oddly political when it comes to promotions - sometimes you work late hours - sometimes harder to ask for more pay
1945,"Rigid structure, promotion cycle / timeline"
2122,"The push for productivity on top of enormous amount of learning material pushed on people here is unrealistic and stress inducing. During the pandemic more work was given than less. Getting a promotion requires you to push numbers rather than do work that benefits the team. All of the number fibbers and cherry pickers are the ones getting the back rubs here. Work/life balance is not respected all that much. It's stated that you should strive for a work/life balance, but the amount of work given does not allow it, and you'll usually find yourself frantically looking for extra time to fulfill work that's been unrealistically dumped on you. KPIs are unrealistic given the extension of some issues that customers raise. Upper management makes quick uneducated changes that usually goes against what everyone in the org would recommend, but they do it anyways."
2288,"This used to be my dream job, I loved telling everyone I worked here and how awesome it was. Then as time went on, I realized it was all fake. The marketing team makes you believe that everything is perfect even when it's not. There is no way to move up even though people say you can. You will be promised one thing then later told the opposite. To move to a different role internally you have to move to a position of the same level or below, you cannot go up (called diagonally) in another department. Even if you make it happen, they keep you at the same pay and level for 6+ months so you will do more work for the same pay. There is NO INCENTIVE TO STAY!! I have known so many people who leave for this reason, then come back a year or so later 3-6 grades higher with better pay and benefits. Recruiters love that because they say it shows how great the company is that people come back, they could have saved themselves time and money by just promoting or transferring the person to the place they wanted to be at. My manager left after a few years and then they hired someone externally who had NO MANAGEMENT EXPERIENCE EVER!!! He was the worst manager I have ever had by far, he was rude, disrespectful, sexist, inappropriate, and completely useless. I was appalled at the way he treated his employees and when I brought it up to HR they basically said I couldn't prove it. Then other employees from a completely different department witnessed him scream at people and they went to HR and still the case was closed because ""lack of evidence"". Several employees were asked to work overtime without pay which is illegal for hourly employees. When I told my bosses boss that I was leaving, they offered me a promotion, but I would have had to move cross-country, and I was told there was no budget for moving costs, so I would pay them all on my own. As for salary, since it was a ""cheaper cost of living"" that there would be no increase. I laughed at this insulting offer to work more, have more responsibility and no increase in money while moving cross country. I declined the offer and they were somehow shocked. I left and never looked back, I am so much happier now that I left."
2452,"Not really seeing much equality at least for my team. Focus is always on HQ folks or team members located in same office with manager. No matter how much hardwork, time, effort & success stories long serving regional folks have, promotions & opportunities always go to HQ & new hires."
2620,"Slightly unorganized, cross-department communication challenges, hard work-life balance, promotions constantly being given to upper management. Work-life balance can be very hard--not sure if this is the place for someone who only wants to work 8-5, especially within Product and Services. Although they say you're only expected to work 40-hour weeks, the reality is that everyone will be working 45-60, sometimes more during certain times of the year."
2937,-Sometimes can get stuck waiting for headcount for promotions leading some to switch to external and then jump back in at a higher role -At times may need to battle internal politics
3221,Pay could be better Non-transparent promotion structures at times
3252,"- Product enablement (super beneficial, but can be really time consuming, so be aware of where the managers priorities are for each enablement session) - Internal promotions can entail internal management level politics - Product suite is large -> Can be overwhelming if you don't like only ""knowing a little about a lot"" vs. a lot about a little. - The bureaucracy and management of a 70,000+ employee business involves lots of 'tick box' exercises that can be time-consuming and take away from job-related tasks. - Working with partners (third-party) to implement the software can be really time consuming for the customer and prolong a deal closing."
3468,Structured time in seat vs. performance-based promotions
3486,Structured time in seat vs. performance-based promotions
3490,"The promotion system is broken. Period. Only promoting 1-3% of your workforce every 6 months is a broken process and gives over-perfoming employees two options if they don't get promoted that round - wait and see, or move into a new role within the company at the higher title. Or, the route I took, leave the company. I understand putting a cap on the amount of promotions each team can have, but it can cause teammates to have to wait YEARS for a promotion they should have just been given. And finally, ""Ohana"" is BS in my opinion when it comes to those in leadership. Those not in leadership totally embody that spirit, but the amount of politics, backstabbing and egotistical leaders in this company is unacceptable. When you disagree with someone who doesn't understand your job but is in a leadership role, you are punished, get duties you enjoy doing taken away from you, and told to make things better without any guidance on what is actually broken. Salary is also way under in comparison to other companies. Salesforce used to be at the top of salary ranges, and have unfortunately not kept up with the times. Every year the employee survey continually highlights these issues, and now with some of the top employees in the company moving on to greener pastures, I really hope they tackle these problems. It starts from the top."
3652,"no control over the majority of your metrics, and therefore no control over your promotion timeline. You spend the majority of the day copying and pasting from linkedin to the org, your promotion is based on your meeting metric which is all about the BDRs performances not yours, as well as headcount which is also out of your control."
3955,"I believe that the REWS leadership is very much lacking. We are forced to baby REWS leadership like royalty to ""show off our hospitality skills"" but don't give the same treatment to even our most exclusive customers. I'm talking Starbucks three times a day with multiple drink options, extravagant catering setups with ridiculous dietary restrictions/preferences, gifts in the hundreds and hundreds of dollars for each exec for each visit, flowers and local fare being supplied in their hotel rooms, etc. These folks live like rockstars on the road. When COVID first started, we had front desk personnel crying because they were forced to stay at the desk. This same org was the first forced to come back into the office. Guidelines were set that everyone were to come back, no exceptions. Yet, we were finding out that exceptions were being made in other offices (unfair). The REWS leadership outwardly encourages employees to look for jobs outside of the org because, although they won't say it, there is no opportunity within it. When promotions or openings upward come available, they are given to those outside the company. The REWS team is the lowest paid org in the company and is treated like a cog in the machine. Very few people feel empowered to advocate for themselves or their teams. I can't remember the last time my team had a team-building, let alone a team-wide meeting. Managers only care about making sure they are seen in a good light for execs."
4168,"As a big company, you sometimes need to work with a longer timeframe in mind; you won't have the agility that you see in a start-up unless you're in a research group. Also, the path to promotion may be longer term than at a smaller company."
4408,There are times promotions are political
4425,"As someone whose been with the company many years, it has transitioned from a smaller, agile, product-focused company to a Marketing and Sales holding company that does little or no product development. Nearly every major product announcement over the last few years featured huge fanfare, but resulted in the product dying a quiet end within 2 years. Pretty much every major product announcement now is just a Marketing 're-alignment', rebranding existing products, not actually developing anything new. All innovation is bought, not developed internally, and there is little sign that the various acquisitions (Mule, Tableau, Slack) are actually creating a 2+2=5 effect. It really feels like a bunch of independent companies that are owned by the same conglomerate. The focus on growth by acquisition also means very limited growth opportunities internally since the existing products aren't really growing or innovating significantly, it isn't creating new positions. A new, related phenomenon is that in order to retain talent, many low-to-middle managers are getting 'promotions in place', i.e. they are getting a bigger title and more money without additional responsibility because their orgs aren't growing. So you see lots of VPs with only two directs who are also VPs, creating lots of unnecessary layers of management who all feel they have to micromanage those below them in order to show they are 'adding value'. This lack of organic growth means a lot of people are attritting because they don't see any real career path. Career development isn't a focus beyond the first line of management. After that its all operations, process and programs. Manager success is evaluated on how many programs did you develop and market, not how many employees did you develop or how productive and happy is your team. Another issue is the split between the company image and Sales. While I do think a lot of product and engineering people do really believe in the company values, remember, this is a company founded by a Sales Guy. There is a very cutthroat sales mentality inherited from Oracle that often sees sales reps and leaders blatantly ignore values like trust, equality and customer success in order to hit their quarterly number. Sales is really the #1 value. The large and not rationalized product stack means that often sales reps are pitted against each other because they have overlapping products, and the result can be the customer gets the product of the better rep, not the product they need. Many products are 'zombie' products with no future product development and virtually no support staff, but because there are reps with quota on them, they are still being sold despite the fact that the customer will likely attrit in a couple of years once they realize they've been sold a lemon. Turnover in the Sales org also means a lot of inexperienced account execs who have zero understanding of the products or the company culture but are still being put on big accounts. Over and over you'll hear how solutions teams are the most vital part of the sales organization, but every award, spiff or shoutout goes to the sales rep. You'll hear about some amazing demo that sold the deal but the only names you will here are 5 different reps/AEs, like they did all the work themselves. They'll pat themselves on the back, go off to sales club and collect a massive commission and the SE will get back to work. Another thing most new employees won't notice at first because they just got their nice offer package, is that Salesforce hires at much higher dollar amount than it pays existing employees. Pretty much every new hire will make a LOT more than everyone else on a team. It's joked repeatedly that if you want a raise or promotion, your best option is to leave the company and get re-hired in a year. Stock is incredibly stingy. Unlike most tech companies that do yearly refreshes, you will be lucky to get new RSUs every 3-4 years, even for very top performers. Many relatively senior employees (15+ years overall experience, 4+ with company) have NO stock. A team of 10 might get 2-3 stock refreshes in a year. This is the #1 retention tool, and yet Salesforce consistently lags behind all competitors here. A lot of lip-service is given to the 'giving back' part of the company. When I joined this was for real. You got a week of VTO time, and if you used all that you'd get a sizeable grant to give to a charity of your choice. They removed the grants a few years ago without making any real announcement. The VTO time is still there but if you are above a certain level, you are on 'unlimited' PTO (which means you can take what you want, but only if your manager is cool AND you don't feel guilty about taking off during whatever crisis is currently happening). This makes the VTO time meaningless, since it just gets blurred in with PTO and sick leave."
4561,"- Promotion wise, being in Sales Development means having to get to 100% on a metrics (numerical) based magic quadrant to be eligible for promotion (or lateral hire). Unfortunately for some individuals, this means their time in Sales Development is extremely extended due to external factors such industry pressures, geography and AE/BDR alignment. A little more focus on a combination of the two and finding the right balance between numerical metrics and knowledgable skills & know-how needs to be recognised/implemented. - Exposure really only to sales vs. other business units. It can feel like BDRs are being put into one bucket (sales making machines) vs. ""you can take your career anywhere"" promised in interviews. Appreciate that most are joining to be a part of our amazing sales team, but it would still be nice to see more of that cross-functional organisation and learn more of other business units who are likely using very transferable skills."
4602,"Recruiting team doesn't understand your profile. A simple example if you apply for a position you will be rejected without contacting the hiring manager, Once you contact the hiring manager he was astonished to hear that your profile is rejected and then once again the interview is scheduled. Recruiting team doesnt understand the pain or the agony that the candidate will be going through till the time these guys say or comeback about anything. Waste of time. Company is good but lot of local politics which makes the company not worthy. Forget about promotions. If you refer anybody they'll be rejected even if they have the skill set, only if you have a strong connection with the hiring manager then you need to share the referral bonus and only then the candidate will be hired,"
4739,"- A very unsafe culture. Predatory behavior in meetings. Only a white can do such a thing and not face any consequences because trust is a right for the whites and for colored it is a loosely hanging privilege which might be lost anytime and needs to constantly work on earning the privilege. I saw people even at Sr.Director level (who was colored) just leaving the meeting not knowing what to say or do. Eventually that Sr.Director (who was top notch) left the team in the name of personal reasons. Believe it or not, those whites even got promotions and MVP awards. - Nepotism is prevalent. I was fully surprised by the way an engineering lead was lifted up to a top level leadership level so quickly (< 3 months since joining) without producing any good results. He was referred by another well positioned person in the team. The guy lacked humanity and was untrustworthy. He was aggressive, inconsistent, unresponsive, over-confident and was stepping on others toes a lot. Even providing feedback in the feedback app with facts to stop doing such things didn't help. - Absolutely no transparency in promotions. People who did great things didn't get promoted and they left. I was a founding engineer who worked for closely 2 years. Many of the peer reviews were extremely positive. I was involved in some of the top level architecture meetings, was openly stated in those meetings that this is a really critical piece so i was needed to do it and ultimately got the job done from me, only to let a white take over the project once it was done and I saw others getting promoted who built on top of the work I had done. My manager didn't say any bad things in our 1:1s, he promoted others, resigned and just before leaving he talked to me for a minute over a phone call and we never met. I was the biggest fool to trust these people. - I was low balled on the pay and the recruiter lied to me that salesforce doesn't do any sign on bonus and negotiations. - Extremely operations heavy culture. Once a product is built and released to the customers, the pace at which things move is unbelievably slow. Leadership kills innovations, condescends on engineers who innovated and worked hard to build the product and makes everything operations centric."
4749,"I joined a smaller company Salesforce owned that was eventually swallowed whole by the larger Salesforce company, and we were fully integrated into one of the major clouds. Things were very pleasant and work was interesting before the roll over into Salesforce. However, once my team joined the larger company, is when things took a turn unfortunately. I believe things took a turn because Salesforce is built on top down management. The bigger the title the bigger the voice you’ll have. People use their title as weight when making decisions. The overall design culture is perceived as a second thought to a lot of teams. Due in part that your engineers can and will make decisions for you based on seniority. Not all, but most teams have a hard time getting their engineers to innovate and work with them. This behavior also comes from the previously mentioned work life balance. Anything that looks like it may take an extra hour, will fall off your design quickly. Be carful of Kool-aid drinking. They use the term “Ohana”, family in Hawaiian culture (which is also cultural appropriation) to describe their own internal company culture. The management team uses this type of thinking to determine if your a team player or not. The type of “family” culture they perpetuate creates a lot of passive aggressive behavior. Add the behavioral issues onto the top down management, and you have a recipe for ladder climbing, favoritism, yes men, and brown nosing. The executive running the design on my cloud showed incredible bias and fueled this behavior. As well as some very questionable hiring and promotional practices. I felt their behavior was highly unethical, and they felt no remorse for their actions. The product you build at Salesforce will only ship 3 times a year. That’s if it ships at all. The pace is incredibly slow moving. I can not stress that enough. Changing an icon can literally take 9 months. This can make it hard to retain the talent that comes from a start up environment. Which Salesforce is in desperate need of. The salary is adequate at best for most designers. I found out later that I actually made much more coming from a different company and rolling into Salesforce. RSU’s are some of the lowest you’ll be awarded in the tech industry for a company this size. Most director level people get any meaningful stock refresher. Like I mentioned, top down management. I negotiated cash over RSU’s (which made my offer compelling). While a lot of what I wrote can seems very negative, not everyone I had the chance to work with made me feel this way. I did have the opportunity to meet “some” talented designers and engineers. I had the opportunity to volunteer and help others. The work I was doing at the time had impact up to certain point and I did learn a thing or two while at Salesforce. TL;DR: Top down management creates passive aggressive behavior. Slow moving development time, Salesforce only ships 3 times a year. Design is a second thought for most teams (but not all). Base salary is average, not competitive. RSU’s for a company this size are some of the worst in the industry."
4767,"This is from our experience..yes OUR because multiple people have expressed identical concerns. General managerial inconsistency and poor and undefined career development Subjective management with unclear expectations and lack of constructive feedback Lack of knowledge and account/opportunity strategy from superiors Unavailability as a resource – poor coaching and lack of involvement with accounts / opportunities Complete lack of trust and transparency with direct line management Inability to coach, mentor and guide effectively – no structure for 1:1 meetings and lack of agenda - Continuous belittlement and criticism despite efforts to improve – general disengagement, lack of proactive coaching resulting in negative retrospective feedback Lack of fair judgment and unprofessional communication in open forums- topics to be discussed in 1:1 posted openly with a belittling nature Unfair and unequal treatment amongst Salesforce employees, specifically at AE level Internal political nightmare with unjustified promotions Unequal territories with no realistic probability of quota attainment unless provided multiple territories with high AOV band Lack of true sentiment for customer success – Many oversold accounts, unhappy customers and forced purchases encompassing a bullying demeanor Lack of true equality in the workplace – Majority of the Southern California hub is Caucasian, where there is a true lack of diversity, where it appears that minorities are hired to meet quotas Distraught office culture full of fear and lack of “Ohana” despite how Salesforce portrays itself Low compensation compared to fair market value for AE per segment False claims of “equality” (approximately 65% White, 79% Male at Salesforce) Continuous micro-management with call center mentality for tenured Account Executives On a final note, there are some extremely judgmental managers, one specifically who came from the Chicago office. Constant complaining, throwing people under the bus and tattle tale mentality making it a completely uncomfortable work environment and actually having people who would rather quit than put up with ""it""."
4783,"Losing sight of the core values the company was founded on. Growing to fast and not able to keep up with overall growth. Seeing lots and lots of angry current customers... 8/10 if you don't have 5-6+ years of inside/outside sales experience, you will only be considered for an SDR or BDR role. This could be fine, but the role should incorporate more closing of business if you are basically expecting people to take a demotion for the role and not articulating the position clearly (this could just be an issue with my office though). If you are on the BDR team you can be the hardest working person and still not hit your number because of how your quota is attained. Your manager will ""help you"" come up with ""strategic plans"" to hit your number (basically just tell you to make more calls/set meetings) but it doesn't matter because if you AEs refuse the meetings, don't feel like moving them to a stage 2 (everyone perceives what this means differently), don't have time to take them until the next month, etc. then you are screwed. BDR management doesn't align with AE management at all. Therefore, they don't care about anything except their AEs closing deals (I don't blame them!), they are annoyed when BDR management comes complaining that their AEs aren't working with their BDR... This is just not a conducive business model and doesn't help growth initiatives. Not everyone is measured the same. You could be aligned 2-4 AEs or 10-15 AEs as a BDR. Either way, these people are expected to generate the same amount of ""stage 2"" opportunity. If you have 2 AEs that are busy, don't work in your office or don't have the ""need"" for a BDR to generate pipeline - then you have NO chance of hitting your quota. SDRs, BDRs and AE's are all expected to generate their own pipeline - which makes sense but it is causing people to compete with each other which takes away from making the customer #1 priority. This is especially bad since the Mulesoft migration... (from BDR POV) Although Salesforce always talks about endless internal growth opportunities, this is def not something that I have seen to be encouraged. You are pretty much forced to take the typical promotion track. BDR Management is way too pushy with BDRs setting new meetings and business, while this should be a significant responsibility, lots of customers get mislead, forgotten, or treated with poor customer service which eventually will backfire (I have already seen it backfire a few times!) As a BDR you could generate $5mil in the pipeline one month, but only have 2 stage two opptys on the board (you need around 6-8)...which means you will miss your quota.

5009,"Diversity Being a white male is a much better chance of moving up and certainly moving up at a more rapid pace or getting to any VP+ role. The ranks of non caucasians across the board in senior roles is small and you can see that the diversity racial numbers are largely inflated by lower level employees. Certainly there has been strides in recent years for diversity and upward mobility for women but by and large this is just white women. Ultimately the saddest part to it is that while Salesforce hired a non white person to lead diversity, his role has largely been symbolic and for external macro political reasons. As tangible cases of diversity issues have arisen on an individual employee basis, invariably it has been the side of the tenured white Salesforce leader who has won the day. Being an employee of color is frustrating at Salesforce because over time things do become patronizing as you are told if you do A, B or C you will increase your chances of getting a reward or a promotion. Yet clearly others do none of the above and those same rewards come their way. Writing this may sound like sour grapes but ultimately the numbers don't lie with employee diversity numbers across the board in middle to senior roles as well as tenure to promotion ratios for whites vs. non whites. Salesforce is not alone in tech let alone the wider corporate culture with this issue. However it is a company that prides itself on being progressive here and it really is not when it comes to employees within the company. Diversity is not a PR headline as we so often seek, it is actually people's lives."
5088,"A few months ago, there was a large surge of hiring. Most of the hires came from a third party vendor that was closing. Some of the new hires from this location were previously denied applicants. I discovered that these new employees were being hired in Senior positions over me, making more money than me, and were even given relocation bonuses that I was told I could not have when I relocated in the previous year to work for this company. When I was first hired, the interview process seemed incredibly difficult to get through. Once they had seats to fill, it became a mad dash to find anyone with any Salesforce experience to fill the seats, and they seemed to do anything to get those people here. I am now left feeling worthless and insignificant in my surroundings. My experience, hard work, and dedication to this company is now meshed into a field of call center employees dashing to meet metrics. On top of the new employees that were hired from this vendor, they also hired managers. I know that people take time to adjust, but these managers are killing our vibe. Salesforce prides itself on transparency. These managers keep secrets and treat employees like worker bees. We have had multiple interactions with upper management where they will talk about a big change, and act surprised when they find out that those of us at the bottom didn't know about the change. The new managers don't understand the need for work and life balance. We previously had options to work remotely when we were ill, or even having an off day. Where we were didn't matter as long as we were doing our jobs. Now, if you are sick and want to work from home, you are asked to take PTO (since you are not given Sick time, you need to use your vacation time)more often, which encourages sick people to come to work and spread their illness throughout the building. Talent seems to mean nothing here as well. It's all about how many years of service. I know of employees who don't put in the effort , who barely get their work done, and they are promoted because of how long they've been here, while I train other employees, mentor, and do still meet metrics, and I'm stuck at the same level. You report to a manager here, but good luck finding your manager if you need something. The Managers are presented as people managers, but when it really comes down to it, they are project managers. I end up doing many small tasks for my manager, that my manager doesn't have time to do, in order to keep my team running smoothly. By no means do I blame my manager for this, but they need to take some of this off their plates. They seem to work 24 hours a day. We recently had a huge push to get our case load down to a specific number. Our portion of the Organization spent 10 weeks squeezing every last drop out of every single one of us to close as many cases as possible. The communication that was sent out read as ""I know you are working hard and thank you for your efforts, but work harder"". After week 8, everyone around me was miserable. There were daily meltdowns from ""Analysts"" who were mad at customers for needing help, when the real problem was the amount of work they expected us to do, and the free time outside of work they expected us to sacrifice. Of course, management didn't see these meltdowns because they were off running Reports on metrics and trying to over analyze the reason behind xyz. When I first came here, I really thought that this was a career. It now feels now different than any call center or retail job I have worked in. This is the longest I've ever worked at a company without receiving a promotion."
5165,"Paths to promotions can be a bit of a ""grey area,"" in which politics seems to play a large part. Fast-paced environment means that there can be an overwhelming number of firedrills. High-up decisions sometimes seem to be made on a whim."

5270,"Some disconnect between senior management and the workers (like every company). Lack of integration between products makes product development frustrating because we constantly fight fires while trying to improve the product. One or the other has to give all the time. Every employee event feels a little weird with Hawaiian music, Buddhist prayers and cartoon mascots. The outside reputation of Salesforce being a cult are far overstated, but it does feel like the culture overall is a bit hodgepodge and unfocused. While promotions are frequent, it's a very flat organization, so there isn't a ton of room for upward mobility. Most people just get a ""Senior"" or ""Director"" slapped to their title, and then if you want more, it's either lateral or out. The problem is that lateral moves are kind of limited without learning an entirely new job function."
5415,Can feel very much like a cult sometimes and promotion is political
5433,"- Anyone not in a direct quota carrying roles is treated as a second-class citizen, and the sales side of the business (e.g. account executives and sales leadership) is revered and constantly lauded on internal calls. - Obsessive fixation on hitting quotas and revenue targets, which drives a culture of upselling (even when the customer doesn't really need it—despite their ""Customer Success"" value). - It is difficult to relate the SE pay and bonus to company performance—despite ever-growing revenues and beating last year's results, this never really translates into a significant increase in pay/bonus. - Murky promotion and career progression process that gets called out every year in the employee survey, but nothing really gets done about it. Hiring budget seems to be spent on bringing in more AEs (the quality of which varies considerably). - The open, sharing culture has led to oversharing, and useful information and documents are scattered across a load of different sources (Google Drive, Quip, Slack, various Salesforce orgs)—with no single way of searching across all of these. - Lots of internal ""noise"", which can distract from the day job (webinars, endless all-hands calls, irritating Slack channels etc). - Internal culture can feel a bit cultish at times and there is a growing disconnect between the US and non-US workforce. You have to drink the Kool-Aid to get ahead. - The internal Salesforce org (Org62) is a mess making it very difficult to navigate, Lots of duplicate data (e.g. accounts and contacts) across the organisation, which leads to internal fighting over territories/customers. - The company swings between big corporate and scrappy startup: some internal processes are excessively bureaucratic and long-winded (e.g. requiring manager approval for a $5 software purchase), and elsewhere decisions are taken on a whim. - Some employees can feel ostracised if they don't submit to the (exceedingly) left-leaning, social justice obsessed political views of the organisation. - A globally distributed workforce means that emails and Slack messages come in at all hours of the day—depending on the team, internal meetings can start early or run late into the evening."

5691,"Growth is slow and even if you work hard/smart and accomplish goals, promotion is never easy over a period of time and number of years"
6188,"1. You have to bear hell of politics 2. It was different when I started but now many of managers lie about promotions, bonus and green card process I think they purposefully delay so that they can retain employees. If they know you can not switch then they will give not give raise or agreed bonus as well. It happened with me. 3. Its not a technology company. There are multiple CTOs, my group CTO does not even know current technologies, they try to solve big data problems using PL/SQL and will force you to do the same even if you know Hadoop technologies or other upcoming technologies. 4. The promotion is based on number of check-ins you can make and managers openly tell that. Its absolutely not related whether you checked in test or some stupid UI / xml fix or a routine to mine billions of events to generate recommendations. How dumb management can be in technical aspect? 5. Most of the product managers and product directors are jokers, they decide future product direction and design with no technical background. They talk about topic extraction using UI and static categories. 6. Its all gonna go downhill with a burst of existing big customers leaving because product is good but page load performance sucks big time or if good technology company comes as a competitor. Its just a matter of time when it is going downhill."
6232,"Salesforce boasts a great exterior perception, but the real deal is less than glamorous. The sad thing is once you’re hired, if you do want to go elsewhere, other employers wonder what’s wrong with you because of the positive perception Salesforce has. I’ve listed several reasons why I have not recommended Salesforce to my network below. Corporate monster: The company tries to stifle employee concerns with surface-level actions like weekly team-lead meetings regarding employee worries, but nothing changes. All that happens is generic and blanket corporate messages funneled back to concerned employees. It takes years to adjust concerns about quota (ie: why is my Oklahoma quota the same as a Bay Area quota? Which, by the way, is still not resolved). Non-promotions: The company touts “rapid promotion” within the sales path, but the honest truth is that the first three to five years (ie: SR, EBR, and ESB AE) are just doormat positions with little additional salary that take longer than promised to get through. Resentment: Additionally, it is a widely known fact internally that the company hires overqualified individuals at a lower level title than they deserve. This creates a consistent stream of resentment throughout the organization. General work/life balance: For SRs (Sales Reps), our stack ranking is a joke. It leads people to act so immorally and just creates more junk for other people to deal with and waste time on. Since we are stack ranked, everyone is afraid to take a vacation since that means their numbers will be behind others that take no vacation. The department tried to alter the policy saying that reps that take at least 4 days off PTO will not have to worry about that month effecting their promotion, but does not adjust their actual quota for the month (meaning your paycheck still suffers). Lovely. Go to Box or Netsuite, or another great startup-like company that will value you. I’ve recommended other companies over the one I’m currently working for time and again. That alone should speak volumes."
6357,"Team/environment/work-life balance depends heavily on your specific ""cloud""; some can overwork, some are so relaxed their product roadmap almost seem dead; some have little promotion opportunities; some completely ignore VTO/PTO Still many diversity gaps Options to move within the company are sometimes limited"
6387,"Learning opportunities are limited, and promotion timelines are subject to change."
6407,Work-life balance is challenging Lack of consistency and transparency in leveling and promotion decisions Employee experience can vary greatly based on department / function / manager Over time acquisitions have started to change the culture of the company (not in a good way)
6416,"Feel under-staffed - W/L balance suffers because even though everyone *genuinely* wants you to take time to unwind, you have a ton of work to get done. At the lower levels, this isn't bad, but I see what my managers and higher-ranked people on the team deal with. Especially with COVID, lots of meetings and that limits productivity. A little too ""woke"", even as a liberal (ie we're distancing ourselves from our Hawaiian/Ohana culture because it's ""cultural appropriation"") - I think conservatives have to keep that mostly under wraps (common in big tech) I've heard (haven't experienced) that promotions are somewhat political and very opaque."
6485,"The ""culture"" at Salesforce is extremely toxic. Everything that they do is purely lip service. Their work life balance? There is none. Diversity, do they make diverse hires? Sure, are you welcome into the office? No. How do they keep getting such great reviews? Take a look at the reviews, most of them are from employees that are 6 months or less. Right after you attend training(which is great) you are sent a survey to rate them on Glassdoor. You are on a high from training and have no idea what you have gotten yourself into yet so you give them 5 stars. Fast forward if you are an AE you are given your territory that has generated virtually no revenue from the year before or was oversold by the previous rep(you are then stuck with handling customer service issues due to poor implementation) and a number that is impossible to reach. Multiple times a week you are required to have a 1:1 with your manager to go over this territory where you are trying to make lemons into lemonade. Nepotism and favoritism runs rampant here. They allow other employees who have ""put in the work"" aka been there the longest to get the best territories and therefore they are hitting their number and eligible for promotions. The irony of this is that they are also tasked with training new employees where they have the attitude of "" pull yourself up by your bootstraps"". They are little to virtually no help because Salesforce fosters an environment where you personally have to be #1. Anything or anybody that could interfere with that is seen as a threat. I could go on about how terrible of an experience this was for me and I also recognize that this isn't everybody's experience as well. However I would be lying if I didn't cringe every time I see articles talking about their next initiative."
6596,"Sometimes employees have an expectation that tenure equal promotion, so when it comes to evaluation time performance often hinders their journey forward, I only say this as a con as Salesforce doesn't do the greatest amount of expectation setting to create a comfortable and motivated environment. Don't make the mistake of thinking that the actual job you are doing is any different to any other inside sales role. They are a corporate company after all."
6598,"The India sales mgmt has a clear objective.Get your people in the company at high posts and get all the performing people out of the company. Recent exit of all the performing people is an example of what is happening. If you are hired from IBM,ORACLE,MS,SAP you are treated like a god and given special treatment in terms of higher compensation,lower targets,promotions etc without any due diligence. Many a times policies are overlooked to promote people who are dear to the mgmt. We talk about equal pay for women,however there is huge difference in how men of equal work experience for same job are being paid. Obviously hiring from our competitors is killing our Ohana culture and making the environment very toxic for anyone to grow."
6639,"Despite not wanting to acknowledge this fact, Salesforce is an incredibly political company to progress in. There is a heavy process around advancement, the main activity being developing your own brand. This involves gaining sponsors at various levels and promoting yourself (sometimes unashamedly) heavily throughout the business. This 'brand campaigning' is by definition political. It is also biased towards those that have the time to commit to it. It is largely dependant on a full and present management chain and those who are actually fully active making a difference at their customers, or who are under resourced and performing multiple roles to serve their customer, do not get the chance to 'seize the opportunity that Salesforce states that it presents. The result is that the talent in the business feel undervalued and the promotions go to the people who have shouted the loudest. It is a real shame, Salesforce isn't the company that I wanted it to be."
6704,"- Management roles are hard to come by, sometimes they prefer to fill management role from outside just because there is no one to replace the most eligible person to be promoted - Overall promotion process has gotten slower over the years, they might say its all your abilities but it some of it is also timebound now - HIGH POSSIBILITY of crazy work schedule and long hours, especially if you are an engineer but they give you comp days, but you might never have time to redeem those"
6746,-Sometimes can get stuck waiting for headcount for promotions leading some to switch to external and then jump back in at a higher role -At times may need to battle internal politics
6848,"- Lack of Transparency in every thing, whether it is promotion, interviews, work etc. Promo - Collect feedback from your favourite people and get promoted to VP even if your sub ordinates or people working under you don't like your style of functioning. Just like typical Indian govt. office promo's where you throw money here you throw feedbacks. Interviews - Whom to hire for the position, what qualities to look for, what job responsibilities should be conveyed, no clarity. Hire and attract talent by throwing industry buzzwords like etc. containers, docker, kubernetes, etc and tell them to work on round the clock patching or deployment work. (No forum to raise this concern apart from glassdoor) - No clear vision from senior/mid senior management/infra leadership. People at bottom most level who don't know what they are supposed to be delivering in infra. Software engineers working on operations work to resolve switch issues and fixing racks, working with DC engineers. They don't have any clarity or vision of future from leadership. (No forum to raise this concern apart from glassdoor) - How to get all star award? Well there are lot of ways to achieve it: 1) Sit in US HQ office and screw things in production time and time again and get a all star award. If you do the same from Hyderabad then you will land into PIP (Performance improvement program). 2) Create a half baked software or an automation working in silo without taking any requirements from actual endusers. Create a hype around it, push it to prod with no proper testing, provide zero documentation, get stocks/promo's/all stars and then move out of the project to screw something else. - No alignment Work for some other team and report to someone else in the management chain who has no idea what are you doing. V2MoM of folks in hyderabad is more of marketing gimmick it fails to provide any alignment, clarity or vision for people working at the ground level. When you are asked to talk about it no ones know how to get it sorted, they just want to keep doing things the way they are because end of the day they are more concerned about there own promo's. (No forum to raise this concern apart from glassdoor)"
7073,"Some internal politics at higher levels made for useless and time-wasting discussions around KPIs that did not matter for the company overall, such as 'call connects' (quality of calls) or which AE got to write the opportunity to his/her name (due to country differences). Weird, since in the end we all work to move the same company forward. Also, we were quite clearly promised promotion within max 14 months. This is now 18 months due to lack of open positions."
7125,"- Despite what is promised repeatedly, there is no real possibility to change department when you're in a career path, especially in sales. - Very high pressure and targets in Sales - CONSTANTLY monitored: Salesforce is the leader in cloud CRM and knows very well how to use its tools to control its employees every single activity and everyday actions, can be quite annoying at times - Uneven between markets: mature markets have a very easy life compared to less matured markets (in monthly targets, promotion criteria, visibility within company, etc.)"
7253,"Applicable only to India team and for the time period this review is written for, - Non technical, director with no salesforce certification and poor knowledge of salesforce products and business. - The above makes this individual a poor leader for a technical team. Under this leadership, the India team has a sluggish growth to their careers. - Unrealistic targets and workloads are set for the team which led to long working hours and high pressure high stress work environment. - Work done here is boring, low impact and repetitive. There was no career defining work in this team for the time this review was written. - Management is a bully, openly threatening and humiliating team mates. Several incidents of this have occurred. But employees are too frightened of retaliation to bring out the issue. - Top down policies and decisions. Team mates have no voice and have to follow all decision leadership makes. - High stress environment created by an autocratic leadership. - Team is expected to work long hours and weekends. - Team are heavily monitored and micromanaged. Egs if you do not clock in by 9 am you will be called out in an email, in a public meeting and reported to HR. - Management is indifferent to creating career growth paths for its team members who do not want to become Solution Engineers. - Limited slow promotions, terrible hikes and highly gated pathways for internal transfer. Management claims that Demo Engineers are highly regarded in the company, yet demo engineers are not top choice for internal transfers, in India. - The leadership of India team creates unofficial policies that are against the overall organisation policies. Examples are non-reimbursement of failed attempts at certification. Use of whatsapp as an official communication channel, tho it is explicitly banned by salesforce. - Skip levels are highly discouraged. These are a threat to India management, in case of whistleblowers."
7523,"While there are some down times, its not uncommon for me to work 10+ hours a day and into the weekends with travel (more normally 1x/week but sometimes 2x/week). With our diverse product set, the list of what a CORE SE is supposed to know grows constantly with insufficient specialist support. I'm a high performer in terms of ACV, but since our comp is more weighted towards team goals I'd rather have a life than have the extra few bucks. I've been asking for help all year, but hiring hasn't kept up with attrition on the team so its getting worse rather than better. I think management does care, but it takes so long to hire and onboard new SEs it takes 3-6 months to get any relief. The promotion process is murky, leaving me wondering if its even worth it to do this. The company says it cares about health and wellness, but Sales is a company within a company with its own culture. In that culture ACV > everything."
7589,1) Competitive promotion process. Time in role is definitely a big factor. 2) Fast-paced work can lead to lack of role clarity & overlapping/redundant work at times. 3) Lack of documentation for certain things. You kind of just have to figure stuff out through trial and error.

7711,"Losing sight of the core values the company was founded on. Growing to fast and not able to keep up with overall growth. Seeing lots and lots of angry current customers... 8/10 if you don't have 5-6+ years of inside/outside sales experience, you will only be considered for an SDR or BDR role. This could be fine, but the role should incorporate more closing of business if you are basically expecting people to take a demotion for the role and not articulating the position clearly (this could just be an issue with my office though). If you are on the BDR team you can be the hardest working person and still not hit your number because of how your quota is attained. Your manager will ""help you"" come up with ""strategic plans"" to hit your number (basically just tell you to make more calls/set meetings) but it doesn't matter because if you AEs refuse the meetings, don't feel like moving them to a stage 2 (everyone perceives what this means differently), don't have time to take them until the next month, etc. then you are screwed. BDR management doesn't align with AE management at all. Therefore, they don't care about anything except their AEs closing deals (I don't blame them!), they are annoyed when BDR management comes complaining that their AEs aren't working with their BDR... This is just not a conducive business model and doesn't help growth initiatives. Not everyone is measured the same. You could be aligned 2-4 AEs or 10-15 AEs as a BDR. Either way, these people are expected to generate the same amount of ""stage 2"" opportunity. If you have 2 AEs that are busy, don't work in your office or don't have the ""need"" for a BDR to generate pipeline - then you have NO chance of hitting your quota. SDRs, BDRs and AE's are all expected to generate their own pipeline - which makes sense but it is causing people to compete with each other which takes away from making the customer #1 priority. This is especially bad since the Mulesoft migration... (from BDR POV) Although Salesforce always talks about endless internal growth opportunities, this is def not something that I have seen to be encouraged. You are pretty much forced to take the typical promotion track. BDR Management is way too pushy with BDRs setting new meetings and business, while this should be a significant responsibility, lots of customers get mislead, forgotten, or treated with poor customer service which eventually will backfire (I have already seen it backfire a few times!) As a BDR you could generate $5mil in the pipeline one month, but only have 2 stage two opptys on the board (you need around 6-8)...which means you will miss your quota. Others could have 6-8 opptys on the board which only adds up to $300k in pipe for the month, but they will hit quota.. Doesn't make sense."

7763,"On a recent survey, two of the lowest scoring questions revolve around people politicking and backstabbing to get things done and the lowest score company wide was promotions are handled in a fair and transparent way. The promotion question has been a bottom 5 scoring question for 2 years now. I have witnessed people promoted either for unfair reasons or because threatening to leave. They pass off a promotion as someone being promoted when in all actuality they applied to an internal job posting and were hired, that’s not really a promotion. The answer to fixing this is not more documentation on careers. They put on a front that they value trust and transparency. They want you to be able to have difficult conversations with your manager without fear of retaliation, but I have witnessed people who speak up and are retaliated against with maybe a Performance Improvement Plan or a demotion. I sometimes feel as if managers and leaders here are talking the talk but not walking the walk when it comes to truly living by the Ohana values. There is a feeling on some teams that it is easier and less stressful not using your PTO vs using it. Tough finding and training multiple backups to handle their job and yours while out. Recently a decline in billable work that has them reassigning people to new careers. It is tough seeing work sent to vendors in India when people at Salesforce are struggling to get billable work. Bonus for some 100% based on billable work which you have no control over. Person A could have 4 accounts and 40+ billable hours, resulting in a very healthy bonus; while Person B might have 1 account and is receiving 10 hours of work, receiving a much smaller bonus. The division of labor is not fair and should be distributed more evenly. Seems a bit unfair when Salesforce gives an executive a $200,000 car and $86,000 watch as a bonus for exceptional work, when you have witnessed others do exceptional work on a smaller scale (not necessarily bringing in $8 million in Sales) and all they get is a Chatter shoutout from their manager or their name mentioned on a PowerPoint slide. I agree with another review here...it is tough dealing with a travel ban, not being able to travel to visit coworkers during a Christmas party, but the top people were all in Hawaii that year.

8005,"A bunch of Oracle execs were hired over the last 3 years, and they have been busy replicating the Oracle culture here. The worst changes to the company have come in at the beginning of 2015. Quality Engineering was de-prioritized across the R&D organization. Many of the QE execs have been given different roles (I am not complaining about this. To be fair, many of these so-called QE execs should be fired. Do we really need 10 VPs in Quality Engineering? QE heads are now reporting to development managers. The road ahead points to converting all teams to Engineering teams. So if you are a QE trying to get a job, look elsewhere. Do not listen to the drivel from the recruiters. QE ROLE IS ENDING AT SALESFORCE! Added to this, the conflicting priorities are ever increasing in this company. R&D is at its 3rd attempt to re-write the UI, and make it adaptive at the same time. The so-called Salesforce 1 app was a disaster. The next attempt is starting in 2015. Although there is not a lot of hope for it, many of the ""leaders"" driving this will surely make hay via promotions and stock grants."

The result is that many people get promoted solely for political/favoritism , and people who actually have technical skills can get lost if there is no one mentoring them on how to play the game. And as other people have mentioned, employees do get rated by their managers every year, but they never see the results of their evaluation. The typical ES response to this will be ""Salesforce is not for everyone"" - but this should not take the place of transparency around the promotion process, especially in a company that touts itself on being transparent in every other way. The whole situation is a really messed up way of dealing with the fact that there are too many talented and driven people here. Work life balance, especially in regional roles, is nonexistent. During a regional rotation, I was actually paid less than my San Francisco salary per our mobility policies, but I was expected to lead projects in San Francisco AND the regional location. The result was 15-18 hour days, 6 days per week. Even though I discussed the concerns I had with my manager, their response was the typical ""Maybe Salesforce just isn't for you."" The situation did finally get better after I sought legal advice, and realized that this type of working structure was actually illegal per the local environment. However, it was clear that the escalation was seen as politically incorrect, and the regional rotation quickly became a dead end with no career growth or development. I was lucky enough to find a team in San Francisco that was willing to take me as a way out, but I share this as a cautionary tale for anyone considering taking on a similar role. Make sure you have a good local attorney, as many teams at Salesforce are predatory, and see the rotational experience as a way to get you to take on more for less money - they will retaliate against you if you try to escalate concerns about your work environment (and on the other side, try getting anyone in San Francisco to take a call before 8am or after 5pm, and people will act like you're crazy - it's a complete double standard). Salesforce is going to start offering more and more roles like this outside of San Francisco to reduce costs, so be sure you know what you're getting yourself into and how you'll be supported if you take one of these on. Operations are a complete mess with many groups doing the same thing, each one trying to assert themselves. Ever since I've been here, there seems to be a focus on wellness, though this gets rebranded time and again as different initiatives. The end result is that people are super driven from 8-5, but cut corners so they can make it to that 5:30pm yoga class. I'm not saying people should work 24/7, but this is an example of how Salesforce and its culture often embody mixed messages (grow grow grow but make sure you have a balance). The result is a lot of groups who say ""This isn't my problem/I'm not owning it/Find someone else to talk to."" In a matrixed environment, this becomes really frustrating - especially as the company has gotten so much bigger. Ultimately, the Company is becoming larger and more bureaucratic - many employees are not receiving raises this year because the company wants to focus on bottom line growth at the expense of its people. At some point over the last 10 years, my day became 100% focused on managing the politics as opposed to creating value and focusing on work I enjoy. Because of this, I've decided to leave Salesforce after a long ride. It's bittersweet, but kind of like that song - ""You don't have to go home, but you can't stay here""; the writing is on the wall in terms of where this company is going - the culture has is getting more and more eroded with the growth. As a final word of warning, I will just encourage all potential candidates to take Salesforce marketing with a grain of salt. Salesforce is one of the only companies I know of that has an internal marketing team who is tasked with trying to tell you how you should feel about the company. Yes, it's true - they have done a lot of great things, but usually the motivation behind it is much more about showing how this initiative is part of the Salesforce brand, as opposed to genuinely providing assistance to someone or some organization that needs help."
8181,"After my long tenure and many Dreamforce conferences, I'm nearly fried. To say the culture is fast paced and the focus is always changing is an understatement. The reason Salesforce always seems on top, and chasing the latest trend, and in the press, is because employees are expected to run harder, carry more, cheer loudly, and pivot constantly. It's the world's biggest startup in behavior. But at the same time, with the recent influx of top career sales leaders from Oracle and what appears to be a board-level mandate for doubling revenue, employees are being asked to do even more with even less, fill higher quotas with smaller territories, less help, and the big company bureaucracy is rearing it's ugly head. Worse still is the politics. When you hire a bunch of smart, aggressive people, and put them in an environment of outsized expectations, throw in a bunch of re-orgs and changing management, and sprinkle with uncertainty and constantly changing priorities, you inevitably get people back stabbing each other and throwing others under the bus to appear smarter and more worthy of promotion. The few at the top will get very, very rich. The rest will lose the sense of personal ownership and start to wonder why they've given up health and family"
8694,- no warm food by default :) - bit of a rolex mentality - disparity between internal promotions and external hires (industry standard but antiquated) - bit too much bashing of competitors sometimes (but it's fun too at times)
9436,"- Not really a meritocracy, although likes to be seen as one - Too many right place right time promotions to those without the ability, leading to failure - Political in many parts of the organisation - Long hours to get anywhere - Salaries reviewed infrequently"
9506,Some messaging fails to get down to all levels. Some lower level managers focus on things that do not seem aligned to who we are and how we do it and seem to focus too much on cost savings. Internal promotions seem to be passed up as an opportunity to grow existing talent over hiring outsiders that come in and have to learn the culture (which takes a little time)
9529,Hiring and promotion decisions are at times perplexing. Senior leadership seems disconnected from the masses. The organization is getting big - HR needs to be more involved and influence more.
9757,"Long growth path, very slow Favoritism for promotions Encouraged to work overtime regularly, very demanding job"
9838,"Slow promotional path, AEs rely a ton on solutions engineer. Difficult time management"
