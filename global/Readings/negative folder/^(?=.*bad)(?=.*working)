247,"The location is awful, it is depressing to work not in the city center - yes they’re moving to the docks but it’s still pretty far from downtown and won’t happen before 2021 No food - just some snacks, and pretty bad/unhealthy ones. These 2 points might seem trivial, but you will spend quite a lot of money on Luas and food, trust me, not to mention the time lost when commuting Career progression is there BUT it is extremely slow, which means it also takes a lot of years to move out of Dublin if you want to stay with the same company (4/5 years) It takes a lot of networking to move between functions (BDR to SE or CS) Harsh split of fixed and variable salary in AE roles (50-50) Level of stress always depends on the manager you get There’s not much of a fun element at work, besides the people, who are for the most part lovely and motivated. But no fun company kick off abroad, no cool off sites abroad, no happy hours, no end of quarter drinks... just compare it to other big tech company like Linkedin and Google - it’s much more boring The WFH policy for sales dev is non existent (1 day/month). Pretty ridiculous when this is an EMEA HQ and people are coming from all over. Allow people to go home and work from there to see their families, without having to take PTO all the time. Politics - it is a corporation, so it is political. It’s very clear that sometimes people get a role over others just because they are better liked, not because of their skills. Always need to show your best face which can be exhausting"
330,"Worst management - They will never listen to you. They'll only do what they want to do and all your ideas will be given to others and they are projected as their ideas. Totally biased and even after multiple feedbacks with the proofs they do not want to accept. They will always tell, there's more to come in the future stay tuned. It's not about promotions or hike percentages. It's about ethics and integrity which the management will oversee always. Sometimes it's clearly evident and visible to everyone in the team that something wrong is happening and the local leadership in Hyderabad, never want to fix it. They just want to bypass it saying the (people who get support from management) trying to do something extra why don't you support him instead of giving feedback. Later, the people who actually want to work as a team and share some feedback with the managers will be targeted big time and will be treated as like slaves or even worst them, Support - Worst support that I have seen in the service industry. These guys never understand its a product based support, not a BPO. With Salesforce having three releases a year with all upgradations & patches, it will be difficult for a support person to keep up to date all the time. The worst way of calculation with regards to the headcount. They say they're hiring people but for a quarter 50 people for a backlog and burden of thousands of cases is not working. Outdated metrics are being used to calculate productivity and other year-end calculations. Employee Success or HR: Apart from very few members Zaira Banu & Rajesh I do not see others responding to the questions raised by the employees. I'm not biased towards the above two but however, their work speaks for themselves. Now coming to the recruitment, Salesforce always recommends the employees to refer people to the organisation, however, the recruitment or referral process is worst (there is no other least word for this). I have referred around 10 profiles to this organisation, all the profiles haven't been considered. They stay in the first or second stage for almost 2 to 3 months and then the status changes to No longer in consideration. When we try to contact the recruiter there will be no response. FYI, the above mentioned 10 profiles have been selected in other organisations for better positions and better packages. It's clearly evident on the floor that there is an agreement between the manager and the respective team member. The team member will refer people and the respective manager will select that profile. Once the team member gets the referral bonus it will be shared by the team member(who referred to the profile) and the manager who recruited."
373,"1. If you're hired as ""Success Agent Tier-2"" for CRM support then your Salesforce career is over because you'll be working in a specific skill group (Configuration, Usage or Email team) and do not get any chance to explore the real Salesforce CRM tool. 2. Management do not to monitor/plan their employees leaves(PTO's) properly which again makes very difficult to work with a huge backlog of cases. You can expect 25-30 cases per agent in AMER shift or 30-35 cases per agent in EMEA shift. NOTE: I have worked in Wipro (worst of all IT companies) so I am very well aware of overload/ extra amount of work. 3. They do not have enough ""Tier-3"" resource which makes your life miserable because as Tier-2, you'll be the only point of contact for the customer who has raised a case. If customer escalates the case or gives you DSAT due to the delay in resolution, then it won't affect Tier-3's performance. Management will simply blame you. 4. So many bugs/ Known issues in every major releases which will make you cry like hell as a support agent. 5. If you ask CSG management to hire more resources to reduce the back log, they'll simply say - ""No we cannot because we do not have enough budget"". 6. HR team sends out an employee survey link in each quarter but that doesn't make any change in your work life. 7. Also when it comes to ""Employee referral""(if your friends, relatives or siblings gets hired then you get $2000/each) program in Hyderabad is one of the most ""Corrupted"" program they've. I have seen 3 examples of corruption in referrals where managers referred their siblings who has really good terms with the ""hiring manager"". They all got selected and each manager earned easy $2000 + Family member (as a salesforce employee). So again if you're hired as Success agent Tier-2 then forget about referring anyone. 8. No way you will get Onsite chance. Strict policy. Also please do not dream of getting free passes/visit to Dreamforce event especially if you're in India. ()"
1946,"There are reviews here with 0 cons which I find hard to believe for a 60K employee company. They jam public surveys down our throats to get the image of the ""Best place to work."" Seems like HR is rushing to drown out poor reviews.... Salesforce is an okay place with some very, very toxic people. I've met one of the worst human beings of my life here, and with how the world is in 2021, that's saying a lot. First-line leaders are more often bad than good. Back office draws territories randomly every year, and leaders have very little say, so it's the luck of the draw. Under 20% of reps hit quota and meet their OTE for a company already underpaying due to their name. You need to hit quota to get paid a reasonable amount which only happens once maybe twice a year if you're lucky. Managers won't acknowledge that you have a bad territory and have the same expectations as the leading rep. Leading rep makes 3 to 4 times the amount of everyone else and is put on a pedestal but everyone including themselves knows it's the opportunity given. Accounts change every year, so prospecting is demotivating, knowing the work you do will go to someone else. Essentially an order taker with not enough orders to hit quota. Very saturated market. Inundated with pointless nonrevenue generating admin work/meetings. Inundated is an understatement. The majority of the information logged within the CRM is fake due to the pressure to meet all of the initiatives and stay off the naughty list. Leading to inaccurate reporting which leads to increased expectations. You will be drowning, gasping for air as your first-line leaders stand on your shoulders with their heads out of the water... for the most part. If you can tread water for 2+ years, you will get the Salesforce stamp of approval on your resume to find a better, higher-paying job. 2-3 year turnover is drastic. HARD WORK DOES NOT GET YOU AHEAD. Your mental health and wellbeing will deteriorate. Please do your research and reach out to folks working there to get their opinions."
2377,"Another tech giant trying to spread the company culture kool aid but doesn’t recognize or address terrible leaders and managers or self appointed “lead EAs”. Very toxic, backstabbing politics going on amongst executive assistants which creates an entire group of disgruntled, distrustful, and power hungry EAs and makes most EAs carry a bad reputation at Salesforce. Execs and managers who have EAs: some of them need serious management training and learn how to treat everyone under them fairly. This was by far some of the worst treatment I’ve ever seen from an exec who had an EA. Micromanaging, having other people spy on the EA and report back to him about the EA's whereabouts and movement.. The EA was treated like a prisoner. Also, there are some EAs who support C-level people and they act as if they are the exec's themselves. They wield their execs' status for their own power and control over others. It's ridiculous and I don't know if the execs who have EAs even know that their EAs are doing this. I hated working with any execs who had EAs. It was always a massive hinderance to my work progress. I don't understand Salesforce and the EA culture.. some are really great EAs but some are terrible and unfortunately they are the EAs at the top.. usually supporting SVP and up. I wouldn’t buy into their culturally appropriated “OHANA” and other Hawaiian sayings. It’s all a facade."
2463,"People management is very bad... There is massive title inflation. 0-1 year of experience managing people marks most directors, and even many senior directors. There is a serious problem of cronyism in many departments. VPs promote who they want, when they want irrespective of team feedback or even despite what are believed to be established policies. VP-level leadership exhibits schizophrenic decision making, CYA behaviors and abrasive comportment. This makes for highly stressful working environments and is a key cause of the well-known burnout at Salesforce. Many leaders at Salesforce have never done a job this big before which can lend to insecurity and erratic or absent decision making. Reorganizations are painfully frequent which also promotes insecurity & stress."
2805,All the positive Glassdoor reviews for Salesforce are the same. That's because they make new employees lie and fill out five star reviews saying they've been there a year during new employee orientation. Ohana is just propaganda. This company is incredibly irresponsible with their customers and you will feel bad every day working here. Read the one star reviews and ignore the identical fake five star reviews.
4365,Nothing bad to say about Salesforce after working there for almost 3 years!
4389,"I came into Salesforce like every rep, excited and eager to get my “MBA” in sales. Working here you’ll have to be prepared to give up everything just to stay afloat. In the first year you will most likely be given a terrible territory and what you do with it will decide your future here. Things you will need to juggle effortlessly or will lead you down the road of being let go are: - Activity- lots of calls. People who fib numbers here are celebrated by leadership but frowned upon by reps - Opp rigor- the amount of fields you will need to update are mind numbing - Pipeline- with a terrible territory be prepared to pipe aspirational pipeline that will be highly scrutinized - Prep meetings- there are endless prep meetings before calls. Due to schedules each person involved will require a prep meeting, leaving your day with little time for anything else. - Team selling- be prepared to sell with folks much junior than you and not held to as high of standards. If the deal falls through, it’s on you. There are a few coprimes that are skilled sales reps - Your “brand”- It’s important to maintain appearances, even on bad days. Your brand is determined by how involved you are in diversity, volunteer work, and leading the team, which requires tenure. -Manager 1:1’s- these are a trap to look out for. Salesforce preaches trust as one of it pillars, but beware that everything said in those meetings will be used against you when they have soured on you - Time management- working a 12 hr day is table stakes. There are endless distractions you will need to navigate and make hard decisions on “brand”/ appearance maintenance vs selling The work/life balance is very heavy on the work side. The exec team repeatedly say their biggest regrets are not spending enough time with family. This will never change if they don’t take it serious. There is a lot you can learn here but at the expense of your self confidence as some managers make you feel worthless when your awful territory isn’t performing. If that isn’t enough to make you steer clear, the pay is very low and less than 20% of reps hit their annual numbers The “Ohana” culture is a mirage. There is nothing remotely familial about the culture. It is an ultra competitive pressure cooker. I just had such higher hopes for my experience left disappointed..."
4414,Nothing bad about working here
4439,"Terrible culture that promotes relentless toxic positivity. Overworked, underpaid, over stressed- but do it with a smile. I had a miscarriage and was told that “I’d be taking a risk” if I took time off to recover. I reported this threatening and abusive behavior to HR and they did nothing. I had another boss who would talk badly about other team members, sneak around and spy on group chats, verbally abuse employees. I took a lunch one day and didn’t answer him immediately after he IMed me- and he said “so are you just not working today?” Im 10 years into my career and have never been treated SO badly by a company."
4511,bad time issue and working problems
4783,"Losing sight of the core values the company was founded on. Growing to fast and not able to keep up with overall growth. Seeing lots and lots of angry current customers... 8/10 if you don't have 5-6+ years of inside/outside sales experience, you will only be considered for an SDR or BDR role. This could be fine, but the role should incorporate more closing of business if you are basically expecting people to take a demotion for the role and not articulating the position clearly (this could just be an issue with my office though). If you are on the BDR team you can be the hardest working person and still not hit your number because of how your quota is attained. Your manager will ""help you"" come up with ""strategic plans"" to hit your number (basically just tell you to make more calls/set meetings) but it doesn't matter because if you AEs refuse the meetings, don't feel like moving them to a stage 2 (everyone perceives what this means differently), don't have time to take them until the next month, etc. then you are screwed. BDR management doesn't align with AE management at all. Therefore, they don't care about anything except their AEs closing deals (I don't blame them!), they are annoyed when BDR management comes complaining that their AEs aren't working with their BDR... This is just not a conducive business model and doesn't help growth initiatives. Not everyone is measured the same. You could be aligned 2-4 AEs or 10-15 AEs as a BDR. Either way, these people are expected to generate the same amount of ""stage 2"" opportunity. If you have 2 AEs that are busy, don't work in your office or don't have the ""need"" for a BDR to generate pipeline - then you have NO chance of hitting your quota. SDRs, BDRs and AE's are all expected to generate their own pipeline - which makes sense but it is causing people to compete with each other which takes away from making the customer #1 priority. This is especially bad since the Mulesoft migration... (from BDR POV) Although Salesforce always talks about endless internal growth opportunities, this is def not something that I have seen to be encouraged. You are pretty much forced to take the typical promotion track. BDR Management is way too pushy with BDRs setting new meetings and business, while this should be a significant responsibility, lots of customers get mislead, forgotten, or treated with poor customer service which eventually will backfire (I have already seen it backfire a few times!) As a BDR you could generate $5mil in the pipeline one month, but only have 2 stage two opptys on the board (you need around 6-8)...which means you will miss your quota. Others could have 6-8 opptys on the board which only adds up to $300k in pipe for the month, but they will hit quota.. Doesn't make sense."
4882,"Office Sucks really bad (NYC 3rd ave) . They have a call center layout so you're sitting side by side next to someone for 8+ hours with absolutely no sense of privacy for 8 + hours. It does not ""promote collaboration""- its a way of cutting costs with a cheesy tagline. Imagine working next to someone you don't even like sitting next to... ""what are you eating, who are you on the phone with, what are you doing , where are you going, etc etc..."" Horrendous. The office air quality is poor, the desks are old and the tiny desk partitions are small and dirty looking. Hopefully the Tower will be better."
5023,"SALESFORCE no cons to working here, OLD company my old job was at a sunnyvale EHR startup and they have a repressive culture, long hours, low pay and bad culture with micromanagement"
5409,bad time issue and working problems
5607,"-(pretty shallow) bad snacks, no complimentary lunch options -enterprise software work could be less interesting and results in customer support being a higher priority a lot of times -development often relies on the internal framework which is a shared code base that can be modified by anyone; this can cause problems well developing a new feature -Agile development might not be cup of tea for everyone (one must always account for each hour of each day) -People could seem a bit too cheerful about working at SFDC"
6002,"I did say ""caveats"". -RSUs are low as compared to FAANG and there are no refreshers - hence, there are a lot of boomerangs, and a reputation as a ""retirement home"", because there is no reward for working harder if you are not also trying to get promoted. -Despite claiming to have a culture of open debate, it doesn't exist and there is seemingly no motivation to change this. For example, even though they say they will answer forum questions relating to the weekly allhands, they never do if it pertains to an internal policy. There is no upward feedback mechanism, except for your direct manager, and on many teams this is a ""player/coach"" who has no involvement in setting the policies of the department. There is an ""airing of grievances"" forum but it is heavily ""tone-policed"". Bottom line is that if you get stuck in a bad situation or team, your options are to change teams or leave, there is no opportunity to improve things from within. -Silos and a lack of coordination result in many internally competitive and duplicative efforts, and inefficiencies. Product-wise there is crossover between Marketing Cloud and Pardot, Tableau and Einstein; and Vlocity/CPQ/B2B Commerce for example. Whatever's new and shiny (acquisitions and Dreamforce announcements) gets love, but if your area is not, good luck getting Trailhead modules or product management to prioritize new feature development. There are approximately 90 billion different efforts to create documentation for consulting resources for how to do their job, all run by different groups and stored on different platforms. And because Slack and Microsoft are viewed as competitors, there is no company-wide collaboration tool like Slack or Teams, it's just a bunch of incomplete tools like Google Chat and Salesforce Chatter and Quip and email and.... -There tends to be a lot of politics between teams, even beyond the product-related competitive/redundancy issues. In short, if you like what you're doing, and who you're doing it for/with, you're in a great position. But if you don't, you're going to have a bad time. I don't know anyone who was unhappy with their situation in Salesforce who subsequently made it better, at least without changing teams."
6201,"- bad work/life balance - working in G&A is not valued - leaders earned promos based on who they know and how they self-promote rather than quality - ""art of war"" mentality - boys club/female leadership minimal at best - titles are very similar to old school banking; there are so many layers of VPs it's mind boggling"
6595,"There has been no attention paid to the mid level management that was hired. Especially in the IT Project team. People leave managers, not companies. I feel I work under a manager who is straight out of the Dilbert comic strip. Numerous attempts have been made to fix my working relationship with this manager, with no results.

6848,"- Lack of Transparency in every thing, whether it is promotion, interviews, work etc. Promo - Collect feedback from your favourite people and get promoted to VP even if your sub ordinates or people working under you don't like your style of functioning. Just like typical Indian govt. office promo's where you throw money here you throw feedbacks. Interviews - Whom to hire for the position, what qualities to look for, what job responsibilities should be conveyed, no clarity. Hire and attract talent by throwing industry buzzwords like etc. containers, docker, kubernetes, etc and tell them to work on round the clock patching or deployment work. (No forum to raise this concern apart from glassdoor) - No clear vision from senior/mid senior management/infra leadership. People at bottom most level who don't know what they are supposed to be delivering in infra. Software engineers working on operations work to resolve switch issues and fixing racks, working with DC engineers. They don't have any clarity or vision of future from leadership. (No forum to raise this concern apart from glassdoor) - How to get all star award? Well there are lot of ways to achieve it: 1) Sit in US HQ office and screw things in production time and time again and get a all star award. If you do the same from Hyderabad then you will land into PIP (Performance improvement program). 2) Create a half baked software or an automation working in silo without taking any requirements from actual endusers. Create a hype around it, push it to prod with no proper testing, provide zero documentation, get stocks/promo's/all stars and then move out of the project to screw something else. - No alignment Work for some other team and report to someone else in the management chain who has no idea what are you doing. V2MoM of folks in hyderabad is more of marketing gimmick it fails to provide any alignment, clarity or vision for people working at the ground level. When you are asked to talk about it no ones know how to get it sorted, they just want to keep doing things the way they are because end of the day they are more concerned about there own promo's.

7062,"1. Horrible management and lack of leadership and responsibility 2. Salesforce Hyd R&D does not hold the title well since most of the work is service based. 3. The R&D management does not offer growth, leaders of this group are very impatient and rude. Not worth being in good books. No respect given to peer’s and sub-ordinates, R&D management is only concerned about its own position and growth. 4. The management in Hyd office will claim that Salesforce among the best companies to work for - this is true but only applies to the US head office, certainly does not apply to Hyd office. 5. Don't be surprised that young employees working in this company for quiet some time can be political and very influential. 6. The maturity in most employees is below par. They have only one thought in mind, how to grow and get more money no matter if they have to step over there own colleague. 7. Work life balance is bad in some teams. Expectation is you will have to slog and meet the deadlines. If you don't then you need to look elsewhere. 8. Salesforce Hyd has always been on the HQ's radar in terms of quality of work and deliveries. Unfortunately the situation is not good. 9. Quality of work is ridiculously below par. People don't care if the code is messed up, all that is important is releasing the product with the proposed feature. 10. In some teams, employees argue and embarrass each other with respect to deliveries. They don’t care about one’s self respect, no respect for other colleague, finger pointing is a very common phenomenon. 11. Feedback sickness - management will constantly take feedback from diff employees working in your team, if anyone gives wrong feedback; that will not be communicated back to you, instead it will be used against u. 12. Employees in most teams are impatient and hungry for growth. Verdict – Employees in this company have low self-respect and self-esteem."

This is obviously not the case with all departments - but my rating reflects my horrible experience with my department that has been embroiled in chaos for more than a year, with no end in sight. This department is central enough that the dysfunction here, will eventually result in a bad decisions for all other teams that interact with it. The leader of this department has created an unhealthy work culture, where people do things because of fear. The leader openly chides senior leadership in public for small infractions, and does not accept dissent. They have openly punished individuals for speaking up. The working style has become uninspiring because pomp and show are prioritized over true value creation - this is demonstrated by the fact that the top achievements of the department as highlighted by the leader themselves are theoretical frameworks, and not actual proven methodologies. There are many smart people on the team, but the leader has narrowed in to their insecurities and manipulates them to make sure they only do and say things the leader wants. Otherwise, they are very efficient on getting rid of people who do not “please” the leader one way or another. HR is kind but plays the therapist role rather than a facilitator. At least 25 people in our department have talked with HR. All we’ve heard is “Awww” and “it’ll get better, we will coach them” for the last 6 months. Can’t say we haven’t tried. We can’t all switch teams and ultimately it is the company’s responsibility to weed out bad leaders. It is not just people suffering (though of course Salesforce will say people are important) but business is suffering because we have a whole department that is wasting money, talent and resources - and no amount of escalation has yielded anything."
8663,Nothing is bad. Hard working
8840,"-You basically can’t trust people in your own team cause they will find the way to steal your accounts and opportunities. -People are selfish and self-focused, they won’t help you unless they will get something in return. -If you are an Account Executive and you want to spend time with an SDR, you will be judged cause they hate each other (worse than a kindergarten). -No balance at all between work life and private life: you are asked to work at weekends, work at night after entire days in the office, work during bank holidays (well, bank holidays are not allowed). Allowed to take days off only in August and February. In some teams like mine you can’t even work from home. -You have to travel abroad 3/4 times per month and they want you to take flights at dawn or at night cause “you can’t lose working hours”. -One of the best values is volunteering - guess what? Underestimated and not taken for real in my team. -Managers only care about numbers, you are not a person at all. -People underestimate people working in other companies cause they feel they are the best but they are so poor and sad inside. -If people leave cause they feel bad, the other “teammates” and managers will make fun of them. -Micromanagement: your manager will expect to be cc’d in every single email you send to your customers."

9618,"-Although I love the company culture of giving back and always pushing harder and faster, it can ware you down if your not careful. Pacing yourself is very important. -Upper management (VP and above) mean well but manages to make the team nervous and work off of fear of being made to look bad in front of the entire department. -Recruiters often have a tough time working with our support (Keeping in mind that sourcing support is something a lot of recruiters don't have experience with before coming to Salesforce)"
