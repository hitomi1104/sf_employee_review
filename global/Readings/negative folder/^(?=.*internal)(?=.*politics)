753,"I know a lot of ppl who are very happy, but I can only speak about my team and that there are teams at salesforce that are very bad culture and don't value or follow a lot of guidelines that Salesforce has in place. Also overall, Salesforce has a lot of internal politics."
869,politics are heavy and you'll find yourself in the sour end of the stick real quick if you don't play along. Ideas aren't welcome if you don't have seniority Red tape to get approvals for anything is strong Bad internal communication
906,"The people think they are amazing, they are average. Its got the normal big company politics, and is more of a marketing machine than owners of any revolutionary tech. Externally thought of as leaders in tech, but really internally very behind the times on cloud based computing. Quite a large monolithic stack, that has not evolved in a long time. Any innovation here is bought in acquisitions, which are very poorly integrated into the whole."
1031,"The workforce is not very diverse and the environment is all about doing what it takes to launch product without any thought to employee burn out. No work/life balance & their work from home policy is also misleading. Layers and layers of politics beyond anything you will ever experience (& I've worked for some large corporations but nothing like SFDC)! More often then not, people get promoted based on popularity & not on merit. Internal opportunities are few as they would rather backfill from outside rather than consider developing an internal candidate. I'm surprised at the number of people that say this company cares about their people as all the depts I've worked with including my own often referred to having a ""thankless job"" and the sentiment seemed consistent everywhere I went - the only exceptions are the employees that are fairly new to the company. I am a firm believer in giving back which is why volunteerism was an important criteria for me when seeking out employees. I was so disappointed to discover that my management saw volunteer hours as a game - ""log your hours and volunteer so we can beat the other dept....I will be checking hours by the end of the week"" This is disturbing!"

2479,Monthly closing of books created an environment of not being able to be more strategic within the group. Lots of politics at the Sr. Sales level and internal channel conflict driven by the compensation structure.
2611,"Inflated titles and absent support staff leads to many ""managers"" and ""directors"" who are purely individual contributers. All managers and directors have individual contributor duties. For people managers, headcount are constantly changing--just because you have a team of 6 this year doesn't prevent half of them from being taken away next year. Management structures change multiple times per year, and even change above the CIO. The internal systems are falling apart and leaders all the way up are much more focused on politics and image. They completely neglect anything objectively meaningful or helpful. The environment has gotten so toxic in the last couple years that leaders semi-openly talk about trying to get out of here. The CIO doesn't lead the organization at all, and everyone goes to either the ""chief of staff"" or the head of the PMO instead. The chief of staff is not qualified / competent to run a single department, let alone being a de facto head of IT. IT is forced to pay for all related costs out of the IT G&A budget with no charge-backs. This inflates our budget and hides that we're actually significantly underfunded, especially considering the technical debt. (we've almost figured out wifi in the last year, but we still need wired hubs in the conference rooms) Much worse than the state of IT is the state of Finance. Every month we're asked to change behavior because something in accounting /finance changed, or something was miscoded or reclassified and no one knew until after the books closed. People and processes change so often that there is no chance of hitting your budget honestly, or even understanding where it came from. We are told that it's worse to be under budget than overbought, because if we're under in any quarter, we potentially lose that budget going forward. You can imagine the consequences of that policy. The financial systems are a joke. We don't know how to support finance and consequently, they can't support us. What we report is massaged by accounting manually in Excel to a degree that we cannot effectively speak to our own numbers. As a result everyone involved is frustrated, failing, and looking for an out. No one in leadership is willing to acknowledge the fundamental problems as the culture requires us to be ever-positve in public and to ""just make it work"", then report success. I believe this is because (1) CEO is a salesman first, leader second, and doesn't want to hear it, and (2) because everyone up the chain would rather claim success and move to a different company, than stay and actually try to fix anything."
2719,"too big, internal politics, slow growth"
2937,-Sometimes can get stuck waiting for headcount for promotions leading some to switch to external and then jump back in at a higher role -At times may need to battle internal politics
3199,poor progression and some internal politics
3252,"- Product enablement (super beneficial, but can be really time consuming, so be aware of where the managers priorities are for each enablement session) - Internal promotions can entail internal management level politics - Product suite is large -> Can be overwhelming if you don't like only ""knowing a little about a lot"" vs. a lot about a little. - The bureaucracy and management of a 70,000+ employee business involves lots of 'tick box' exercises that can be time-consuming and take away from job-related tasks. - Working with partners (third-party) to implement the software can be really time consuming for the customer and prolong a deal closing."
3841,success is defined by the territory you get and how much internal politics you play
3981,"Huge disconnect between who they are and who they say they are, especially within the employee team. I only met a few people who actually knew what the Salesforce platform was, how it was used for different verticals and what the benefits were for customers. Trying to to use the product internally was a comedy of errors. No one understands how it works or how to use it. Too many siloes, even the siloes have siloes. 1200 tiles on okta, are you kidding? Lots of politics and backstabbing. Many problems caused or perpetuated by the very people who say they are trying to fix it. Leadership was more cliquey than high school. From what I saw the opportunity for advancement comes down to who your manager is, but sadly there are a lot of managers who are not qualified at all and are simply afraid of talent."
4432,lots of internal politics and processes
4683,Focus is on internal politics vs sales. Promotions are not merit based and more time is spent selling internally vs to customers. Cloud sales role does not have a clear value to the organization or customers creating constant ambiguity and difficulties in achieving quota.
4865,"Lots of internal politics, no surprise at any big company this isn't Salesforce specific it happens everywhere. Promos are about timing mainly."
5143,"Lots of politics (both internal and, of course, external) almost all of which revolve around left-wing ideologies. Sometimes, support from supervisors can be hit or miss. Easy to get into a rut where monotony kicks in. Sometimes advancement opportunities can be lost because managers don't actually want to promote from within."
5492,Some of the older employees have a great sense of entitlement and huge egos and treat newer folks unfailrly. Some groups go nuts following the internal agile development methodology actually ending up being less effective. Too many layers of management creeping in as the company grows leading to excessive bureaucracy and politics.
5734,internal politics in big company
6002,"I did say ""caveats"". -RSUs are low as compared to FAANG and there are no refreshers - hence, there are a lot of boomerangs, and a reputation as a ""retirement home"", because there is no reward for working harder if you are not also trying to get promoted. -Despite claiming to have a culture of open debate, it doesn't exist and there is seemingly no motivation to change this. For example, even though they say they will answer forum questions relating to the weekly allhands, they never do if it pertains to an internal policy. There is no upward feedback mechanism, except for your direct manager, and on many teams this is a ""player/coach"" who has no involvement in setting the policies of the department. There is an ""airing of grievances"" forum but it is heavily ""tone-policed"". Bottom line is that if you get stuck in a bad situation or team, your options are to change teams or leave, there is no opportunity to improve things from within. -Silos and a lack of coordination result in many internally competitive and duplicative efforts, and inefficiencies. Product-wise there is crossover between Marketing Cloud and Pardot, Tableau and Einstein; and Vlocity/CPQ/B2B Commerce for example. Whatever's new and shiny (acquisitions and Dreamforce announcements) gets love, but if your area is not, good luck getting Trailhead modules or product management to prioritize new feature development. There are approximately 90 billion different efforts to create documentation for consulting resources for how to do their job, all run by different groups and stored on different platforms. And because Slack and Microsoft are viewed as competitors, there is no company-wide collaboration tool like Slack or Teams, it's just a bunch of incomplete tools like Google Chat and Salesforce Chatter and Quip and email and.... -There tends to be a lot of politics between teams, even beyond the product-related competitive/redundancy issues. In short, if you like what you're doing, and who you're doing it for/with, you're in a great position. But if you don't, you're going to have a bad time. I don't know anyone who was unhappy with their situation in Salesforce who subsequently made it better, at least without changing teams."

6812,As Salesforce is growing at a fast rate and now over 30.000 people you will encounter and have to manage internal politics to get things done for your customers. However compared to other big corporate IT companies this is still a breeze for me.
6822,"Too much internal politics, currently the focus is on reducing costs"
7061,9All the policies are not implemented strictly example Dream force and New Hire orientation(boot camp) especially in India (because of budget). Lot of Local Management in India and lot of internal politics
7073,"Some internal politics at higher levels made for useless and time-wasting discussions around KPIs that did not matter for the company overall, such as 'call connects' (quality of calls) or which AE got to write the opportunity to his/her name (due to country differences). Weird, since in the end we all work to move the same company forward. Also, we were quite clearly promised promotion within max 14 months. This is now 18 months due to lack of open positions."
7115,"-Fellow sales people act like children -Very pompous attitude of most people that work there -backstabbing mentality -your success there is defined by your patch -lots of internal politics and sucking up involved -Very deceiving to customers, will say anything and do anything to get the deal done. Testament to that is the insane amount of customer satisfaction issues you have to deal with while there"
7195,Becoming a very political driven company where internal reputation and politics is most important. The majority is not making their numbers. The ones who do can easily loose their territory in order to redistribute to the non-performers. Career opportunties are limited due to external hiring.
7852,"Internal politics, maintaining internal equity, red tape"
8097,"I mean...it's hard to know where to start but I'll try to do my best. First, a lot of people talk about career and promotions - and how there's little to know transparency about the process, nepotism is rampant and the like. The company knows this, which is why ES has done away with giving performance reviews. Now, instead of being clear on what exactly you need to do to move up the chain, they're putting this on you. The result is that many people get promoted solely for political/favoritism , and people who actually have technical skills can get lost if there is no one mentoring them on how to play the game. And as other people have mentioned, employees do get rated by their managers every year, but they never see the results of their evaluation. The typical ES response to this will be ""Salesforce is not for everyone"" - but this should not take the place of transparency around the promotion process, especially in a company that touts itself on being transparent in every other way. The whole situation is a really messed up way of dealing with the fact that there are too many talented and driven people here. Work life balance, especially in regional roles, is nonexistent. During a regional rotation, I was actually paid less than my San Francisco salary per our mobility policies, but I was expected to lead projects in San Francisco AND the regional location. The result was 15-18 hour days, 6 days per week. Even though I discussed the concerns I had with my manager, their response was the typical ""Maybe Salesforce just isn't for you."" The situation did finally get better after I sought legal advice, and realized that this type of working structure was actually illegal per the local environment. However, it was clear that the escalation was seen as politically incorrect, and the regional rotation quickly became a dead end with no career growth or development. I was lucky enough to find a team in San Francisco that was willing to take me as a way out, but I share this as a cautionary tale for anyone considering taking on a similar role. Make sure you have a good local attorney, as many teams at Salesforce are predatory, and see the rotational experience as a way to get you to take on more for less money - they will retaliate against you if you try to escalate concerns about your work environment (and on the other side, try getting anyone in San Francisco to take a call before 8am or after 5pm, and people will act like you're crazy - it's a complete double standard). Salesforce is going to start offering more and more roles like this outside of San Francisco to reduce costs, so be sure you know what you're getting yourself into and how you'll be supported if you take one of these on. Operations are a complete mess with many groups doing the same thing, each one trying to assert themselves. Ever since I've been here, there seems to be a focus on wellness, though this gets rebranded time and again as different initiatives. The end result is that people are super driven from 8-5, but cut corners so they can make it to that 5:30pm yoga class. I'm not saying people should work 24/7, but this is an example of how Salesforce and its culture often embody mixed messages (grow grow grow but make sure you have a balance). The result is a lot of groups who say ""This isn't my problem/I'm not owning it/Find someone else to talk to."" In a matrixed environment, this becomes really frustrating - especially as the company has gotten so much bigger. Ultimately, the Company is becoming larger and more bureaucratic - many employees are not receiving raises this year because the company wants to focus on bottom line growth at the expense of its people. At some point over the last 10 years, my day became 100% focused on managing the politics as opposed to creating value and focusing on work I enjoy. Because of this, I've decided to leave Salesforce after a long ride. It's bittersweet, but kind of like that song - ""You don't have to go home, but you can't stay here""; the writing is on the wall in terms of where this company is going - the culture has is getting more and more eroded with the growth. As a final word of warning, I will just encourage all potential candidates to take Salesforce marketing with a grain of salt. Salesforce is one of the only companies I know of that has an internal marketing team who is tasked with trying to tell you how you should feel about the company. Yes, it's true - they have done a lot of great things, but usually the motivation behind it is much more about showing how this initiative is part of the Salesforce brand, as opposed to genuinely providing assistance to someone or some organization that needs help."
8134,"The culture is that of a big company, and success here is what you make of it. Nothing will be spoonfed, and it is up to the individual to sink or swim. Training is barebones(so seek out resources, and self motivate yourself to learn!), and many sales environments are hyper competitive. The organization is so big that there are redundant processes and internal politics, meaning that success here requires excellent externally facing and internally facing skills(or perhaps an opportunity to develop both for those starting their careers). For a company of this size, I don't think it is possible to avoid the aforementioned cons; that said, new employees who have only worked down or mid-market will need to adjust to a big company work environment, and won't receive much in the way of guidance as to how best to accomplish this."
8984,"There is no culture at all. Ohana, VTO, Customer Success... They are just words. In my team, we were obliged to work on bank holidays and not allowed to take the day back off when it was BH in the country we covered. There is no flexibility in WFH. But what's really the worst is the management. In Salesforce there are no leaders, just poor managers. It all works around internal politics and friendships with people crossing borders continuously. Also, those ""managers"" text you after working hours and have no respect of your personal life. There is no interest in who you are as a person or your background, just how much you're closing. It's the least human company in tech I have ever witnessed and keeps losing talent year over year. I had a burnout and had my manager talk poorly and joking about me with team members and peers. Just one last thing, AEs are pushed to always complain about business partners (Solution Engineers, Sales Dev and Customer Success) when they really are the only ones to make the job qualitative and worth it."
