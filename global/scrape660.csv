It's sad to see how much great talent has left salesforce in the last couple of year because of lack of support for internal movement. Also, salary increase with promotions are often not fair -- the salary is often increased by percentage of an employees' current salary and not necessarily what the new role is actually worth and valued in the market.

It's extremely important that you ask to see your account set and license footprint before accepting the job. - Salesforce grew up from the SMB so the Enterprise group is run like SMB with a very short-term mindset and a monthly cadence. - Much of the support of the organization comes at the last minute after the selling is done and the deal is in the final stages.",9 people found this review helpful

Also of note, before you read too much into the other reviews, take the time to notice how many of the 5 star reviews are can be summed up by ""great place to work but has growing pains"" or ""you get what you put in, slackers need not apply"". I will let you draw your own conclusion on why so many of these reviews sound like marketing message .... It doesnt look like ExactTarget understands that they are no longer a startup. The only people that thrive at ExactTarget are people that have no lives. 50+ hours of work a week is the norm and anyone that does less is considered a ""slacker"" as you might have seen in some of these other reviews. If you do the math, you'll realize that the decent paycheck, which is typically higher than the industry norm, ultimately falls woefully short when you look at how much you make an hour. As you work here, you come to find out that it is very much a cult mindset and you are either in or out. Job security comes from owning tribal knowledge of projects that are integrated in to the platform since documentation is apparently a running joke. There are many processes that have been implemented to ""streamline"" development but apparently the management style here is to implement ""solutions"" and ignore the results because the only thing that these processes have done is add one more point of failure to an already broken system. Contractors are treated as second class citizens. Its common knowledge. The way to get ahead is to brown nose and give up on life outside work. ET is founded on the principle that the reward for a job well done is an opportunity to do more.

Those working in Indy have access to the ET Gym, ET Fun events (golf outings, paintball, happy hours, etc.) and more. Wellness Bucks - employees are reimbursed up to $105 per quarter for gym memberships, yoga classes, crossfit classes, etc. Through the Salesforce acquisition, ET employees receive 6 free volunteer PTO days per year and even have the opportunity to participate in the Salesforce Employee Stock Purchase Program. Until recently, it was fair to say that ExactTarget had one of the best executive leadership teams in all of SaaS.","Over the last year it’s been sad to see how drastically the company has changed. The “orange” culture is fading rapidly and key employees who cashed-out on stock options are jumping ship for better opportunities. Prominent executives recently left the company and top talent is leaving in droves. A massive restructuring is in order and I suspect that others will follow suit once the fiscal year ends and annual bonuses are paid out to employees. If you work out of the Indy office, you can sense the heightened frustration from those around you. Employees are overworked, underpaid, and have huge unrealistic quotas hung over their heads (with shrinking sales territories). What used to be a company driven by young, ambitious, entrepreneurial talent, is slowly turning into a company motivated by corporate greed and pleasing Wall Street. Two years ago, things were very different but now it is much harder to get promoted, receive a pay raise, or advance your career vertically. ET is very demanding and is notorious for promoting the same people (Director level and above) over and over again.

The best visionaries, technical ops (the guys that keep the platform up and running), and internal platform engineers on the planet - these are the guys that deserve all the glory. What is done behind the scenes to keep the app going is nothing short of amazing - several million concurrent users while constantly adding functionality and innovating...and no down time? Come on. It's ridiculous. The tenured and long-timers that are still around are incredible. They're not only the best in the company, they're the best in the industry. Prove yourself to them and they will take care of you. If YOU have the drive and the ability, you can build a career path in the company...and if YOU make a case and have something behind it, it's one of the few companies in the world that will allow you to do so. Salesforce will not give you a map when you're hired that shows you a career path...but if you succeed in the role you're giving and prove yourself and earn trust, they'll actually allow you to create your own. The culture of the company is like nothing else in the world. Yes...you are expected to work more than anywhere else in the world...but if you like philanthropy, no questions asked...go do it - on company time. The best in the business keep coming on board. Marc is the best CEO in the business - different for sure - but the best. For a few years I thought the company had plateaued...several different times (at $750M...at $1B..at $2B...)...but I really do see this company making it to $10B in rev and beyond. Without a doubt. So if you're considering joining Salesforce but are worried about growth, don't be. That should be the last of your concerns.","""Fillers"". I call them ""fillers"" because that's what they are...people that were hired in haste to simple fill roles in an organization that is growing so fast, they had to be hired quickly. While they may have gone through multiple rounds of interviews, it seems there are many execs that got through that shouldn't have and are just filling a role in the org chart. And they don't do s*&^. They may have had extremely successful positions at other companies, but Salesforce isn't like other companies. They only slow you down...so if you're smart and have your i's dotted and t's crossed, just go over them and it's not really looked down upon. Tomorrow. You're only as good as the deal you have committed tomorrow. Doesn't matter if you're at 200% of quota for the year 6 months into it ...that actually only amplifies what is expected of you. It's a con...but in reality...it's also not too bad...unless you're in a Sales role that isn't an AE (i.e. SE) because you're capped. Salesforce has the SE's I've ever come across in the industry, and I don't think they're treated as fairly as they should be. Marketeering. This is a new issue at Salesforce... It used to be the case that marketing & PM were in line and no one sold on futures. Over the past 12 months, that has changed...moving closer to an Oracle-like model where the vision is pitched and then they try to build it. Equity. I'm not sure who is getting it, but it isn't long term sales people. Seekingalpha? They couldn't be more wrong. Granted, the ESPP program is fantastic, but once you get beyond entry level, it would be nice to see something. It can be disheartening to hear RVP's (in 2012 I swear they only brought in people as RVP's...""What? You're an RVP of WHAT? And have no reports?!?!?"") and other new employees talking about selling their RSU's or options when they haven't really done anything for the company yet and you've committed the better part of a decade. Commit. This is probably the biggest ""Con"" at Salesforce if you're an AE or in sales. Salesforce is an accurate machine...it really is...based on the subscription model, a great portion of deferred rev is already established and known...but they want your sales opps just as accurate and mgmt will force or override you on your deals if you think differently. Territory. Don't come to Salesforce thinking you'll be able to pick and choose. It was picked over 5 years ago. You'll more than likely get something you don't want. End of discussion. While it seems like it should be the biggest ""con"", it's not. Because everything I listed in the ""Pros"" section means you will constantly have something new and innovative to sell to that minuscule territory you have that no one else can. I mentioned in the ""Pros"" section that some of the long-termers (those that have been around 10+ years) are one of the best things about the company. They ARE. There are also a handful of high level execs that just need to go...they don't do anything...they show up at meetings and say hello and leave... and you better keep your mouth shut. It sucks. Because at one time they were amazing. Now, just awful.",17 people found this review helpful

Attrition is so high, people have left the team in droves. Management seemed to have wanted that so they can clean house. People are dispensable and not invested in, and it had become a culture where speaking your opinion isn't appreciated, especially in a public forum and especially if it differs from what the leadership thinks. Significant lack of trust in the abilities of most of the designers ( except for the chosen bros ) If you like taking orders and being told what to think this place is for you. If you believe in changing the world, you won't do it here. And don't even think about unconventional design thinking.

There are multiple CTOs, my group CTO does not even know current technologies, they try to solve big data problems using PL/SQL and will force you to do the same even if you know Hadoop technologies or other upcoming technologies. 4.

Its absolutely not related whether you checked in test or some stupid UI / xml fix or a routine to mine billions of events to generate recommendations. How dumb management can be in technical aspect? 5. Most of the product managers and product directors are jokers, they decide future product direction and design with no technical background.

185,The money making boat has sailed,,2.0,"They have a great location at One Market St. across from the Ferry Building. Most people are getting moved to 50 Fremont though which is not as nice. There is an ESPP program that can be very rewarding depending on when you got in, and the facilities themselves are nice. Great collaboration with internal utilization of ""Chatter""","While at SFDC I joined just in time to get RSUs, however, I cashed it all out when it hit $150+ and there really isn't money to be made via stock anymore. At my level they didn't do any refreshes of stock, so once you get it, that's it. At higher levels (SVP+) you could make some money, but it's like that at every other tech company in the valley. I don't have much faith in their product growth either. They have penetrated most of the market and there aren't many new logos coming down the pipeline. Most sales are with existing customers with newly acquired products. Speaking of acquisitions, the M&A strategy of buying everything in sight doesn't seem to be working that well, especially with the new senior convertible notes they are issuing. It is difficult to understand what the product roadmap is going to be like if they keep acquiring random products. Maybe Marc has some tricks up his sleeve, but it's not very clear right now. I agree with some prior comments about having to conform. When I joined several years ago, it was easy to speak your mind and get things changed, but nowadays it's all about conformity and agreeing with people. The performance process is not that good either. They go through a V2MOM process (you can find out more on the web about it) and it literally takes me an entire day to fill it out. They have changed things a bit with ""Work.com,"" but it's just that, work. IT Helpdesk is also not very good in my opinion. There is no walk-up station to get things fixed, you have to call a phone number or open a ticket, then wait until an analyst gets back to you. My first week took a couple dozen helpdesk tickets to get up to speed. There was one day my computer was on the fritz and it took literally an entire workday to get it resolved because there was no walk up station.",2 people found this review helpful

191,Good place to work at,"Feb 19, 2013 - QA Engineer in Austin, TX",4.0,"My first few months with Salesforce is good. I've worked in the field for 10 years and been at companies ranging form large corporations to a small startup. I read some of the one star reviews and think people might have different experiences on different teams or people just have different expectations. As for my own experience, compared to the companies I worked for in the past, Salesforce is a good company to work for. It offers above market salaries but also asks you to work hard for it. No doubt the amount of things to learn at the beginning is overwhelming. Luckily new employees are offered plenty of formal training classes. Everyone on the team is ready to help, too, because they got tons to do and really want you to be able to contribute. The company is growing fast so politics might get worse. But don't kid yourself. Wherever there are people, there is politics. I once worked at a 50 employee startup and had to deal with the constant BS going on in the office. Find a good manager who can shield you from a lot of this if you are a technical minded person. And the company allows you to jump between opportunities if you don't really like your current team and/or manager and they can't hold you back. My previous job was at a large software company, where an internal transfer took at least a few months...an offer letter can take up to 6 months for it to go up the management chain and get a headcount...the quality of software was a mess because the management only cares about metrics and spreadsheets and no idea what they were building. So far I haven't seen the same problems at Salesforce. The scrum teams are very small and agile. They do expect you to do real work very quick but working 10-12 hour shifts is not typical.","Lots to learn in the first 3-6 months, very hectic.

Culture incents people to remain silent and go along with the head person's opinions. Basic cultural inability to use fact-based analysis to objectively evaluate performance or productivity. Managers use gossip to inform performance reviews. Management style throughout the company is very kabuki-ish. Obsessed with classist fear of being seen as touching technology.

223,The perception is not the reality,"Oct 17, 2012 - Sales Representative in San Mateo, CA",2.0,Recognizable company for resume purposes Free snacks,"Salesforce boasts a great exterior perception, but the real deal is less than glamorous. The sad thing is once you’re hired, if you do want to go elsewhere, other employers wonder what’s wrong with you because of the positive perception Salesforce has. I’ve listed several reasons why I have not recommended Salesforce to my network below. Corporate monster: The company tries to stifle employee concerns with surface-level actions like weekly team-lead meetings regarding employee worries, but nothing changes. All that happens is generic and blanket corporate messages funneled back to concerned employees. It takes years to adjust concerns about quota (ie: why is my Oklahoma quota the same as a Bay Area quota? Which, by the way, is still not resolved). Non-promotions: The company touts “rapid promotion” within the sales path, but the honest truth is that the first three to five years (ie: SR, EBR, and ESB AE) are just doormat positions with little additional salary that take longer than promised to get through. Resentment: Additionally, it is a widely known fact internally that the company hires overqualified individuals at a lower level title than they deserve. This creates a consistent stream of resentment throughout the organization. General work/life balance: For SRs (Sales Reps), our stack ranking is a joke. It leads people to act so immorally and just creates more junk for other people to deal with and waste time on. Since we are stack ranked, everyone is afraid to take a vacation since that means their numbers will be behind others that take no vacation. The department tried to alter the policy saying that reps that take at least 4 days off PTO will not have to worry about that month effecting their promotion, but does not adjust their actual quota for the month (meaning your paycheck still suffers). Lovely. Go to Box or Netsuite, or another great startup-like company that will value you. I’ve recommended other companies over the one I’m currently working for time and again.

There are Re-Org's where, leadership, accounts, support, and resources ALL change.

264,A safe harbor for prima-donnas. Quality of software work is very low.,,1.0,"Pay is great. But the stock options and bonuses serve as a gilded whip to hold over employee's heads. If you put aside your better technical judgements as an engineer you'll get along fine here. If you're able to juggle being harassed by a co-worker every five minutes on IM, e-mail or phone and can still get productive work done, you may like it here. You'll learn about about Agile development and how it can really work - in spite of the fact that group managers ignore the great recommendations of the agile training team. During your first few weeks, do some careful analysis on the source code you'll be working with. There's a sense at the company's that it's somehow infallible and should not be questioned. If you disagree with that view on solid technical grounds, you'll be able to quickly determine whether or not you want to stay on. So, that transparency is a good thing. The software release process and software upgrade process is good. So, you'll learn a lot about that. Training is pretty good, but corporate policy has many self-conflicting points.","Don't expect to impact the software products in a meaningful way while you are there. What you see when you get hired in terms of software coding practices is what you'll be expected to follow. And, unfortunately, there's lots of room for improvement. If you interview here, ask specific technical questions about software best practices and you're likely to get a clever ""non-answer."" A lot of nice talk about what could be done, but nothing specific that translates into actual work quality. While the Salesforce agile approach has all the ingredients a successful team can rely on, the use of those practices is whimsical. The management puts its confidence into junior employees who don't know a thing about building quality software. The middle management is useless on projects. The senior engineers are targets that get poked at ruthlessly. The website products are passable in quality, but the other products like mobile are lame. Lots of false starts and recalled releases from what I saw/heard from those teams. The product vision for the company is unrealistic and egotistical. Management professes that it wants their applications to have an ""addictive"" quality, but they don't even know how to approach that problem. I am glad I'm not there.",14 people found this review helpful
