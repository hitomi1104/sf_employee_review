Filled with 'preference' and bias, if your boss like you then you can get the good set of accounts to work on, otherwise sorry you are on your own. To protect their image of best place to work, they 'create' lame reasons to make you leave on your own or terminate you, instead of being seen as firing / layoff people. Lots of politicking between management, the Ohana is a marketing gimmick, the reality is the management are mostly ex-oracle bringing along their old habits and culture and practicing them in here.

13,"Not so ""Ohana"" after all !!!","Sep 4, 2020 - Customer Success Manager in Hyderābād",1.0,Free food( loads of it) Lots of sugar to keep you excited about your company ( at the same time they want you to be healthy) Great office ( even though the decision of if you will get a seat depends on which team you work for),"Equality (Pun intended): IN spite of one of the core values of the company being Equality, the organization is RIFE with inequality. It first starts with who gets a seat at work. A company that boasts of technology and how they help businesses, they have no idea of what their growth is or will be. The tech teams grow inorganically leaving all the other teams to cram into rooms. There is clear discrimination right from senior leadership on who gets a seat and who does not. Tech teams are treated like kings and no one ( including the CTO)has the power to change their minds. There is a very heavy tone of ""ENTITLEMENT"" when any one approaches these tech teams or in discussions with them , something the company is very proud of. Even the facility team listens to what the leaders have to say and implement them. The Internal communication board even has a forum for people to vent, that is a great place for humor, with people complaining about the flavor of yogurt served in the fridge and many more trivial things.This (in)equality is not just limited to seating options but to pay, travel benefits and how they are treated by the infamous HRBP's ( or the human resources) They too clearly are unequal to teams, paying full attention to Tech teams and quite clearly ignoring smaller teams. I have met my ESBP twice till now ( official meetings) in my entire tenure as they are too busy taking care of the bigger teams. And who is there to ask them or question them, no one!! They seem to be the busiest team in the office while none of them are visible in the office post 4PM, imagine now when it is virtual. Talk about an easy job in Salesforce. Then there is a great term that they keep using ""OHANA"" like from an episode of Black Mirror they want to make sure you get sucked in to the idea of ,while the company really does not care. BTW that means' Family"" in Hawaiian, while no one is treated like one. Just giving people a lot of cupcakes and goodies( SWAG as they call it) is only marketing their company and the employees lap it up like puppies with a new chew toy. This is what the company's idea of a family is, give them stuff that is absolutely unnecessary and make them feel like they get ""SO MUCH"". Employees need to be bribed to fill up surveys, because well they don't do anything without a ""gift"". Any one who is planning to work for this organization should be particular about their ethics policies, which is an absolute joke.I am aware of some employees who were victims of this team, they either did not get justice for their complaint or were terminated for wrong decisions. I wish I had that kind of job where I can decide peoples' fates based on whims and fancies and no one to answer to. I strongly believe they have monthly targets to get people off the rolls! I know the HR team will scramble and get this review off this platform in an instant ( BTW one of the other values of the company is transparency). India offices are filled with wrong leaders and sadly nothing from the above will change.",11 people found this review helpful

32,Obsolete Management and Working Style.,,1.0,"Benefits such as wellness allowance, great office location (centre of Tokyo).","JP office is extremely domestic, and does not have the drive, momentum or speed which other international tech firms or a typical foreign sub company has as a working culture. Since the majority of the people in the back office has been working here for a very long time (which is a good thing in one way), many of them are not use to changes - rather prefer to stick to the norm. Ohana is one of the key culture (which is a great conceptually) in Salesforce. But in JP back office, this is recognized in a different/miss leading manner. More specifically, it's been recognized as ""protection"", rather than supporting and challenging each other for growth. This shows up as lack of ownership, professionalism and extremely conservative working style/attitude. If you try to challenge someone, you're taken in a different way. Since there's really no culture of challenging each other, it's taken very offensively --- that's still fine but the most shocking part is, senior management doesn't notice or understand anymore of the benefits of growth via challenges and constructive communication. This is one of the most disappointing aspects of this office where it doesn't show to the outer world --- I have seen another review saying ""a master of disguise"" and completely understand what it means. When joining, do not expect a high paced, competitive working style lead by professionals with strong ownership --- but rather expect a conservative environment, hence for those who are looking for growth via challenges, constructive communication and data driven decision makings, this may not be the best place for you. Money is good, but growth wise, not able to recommend.",5 people found this review helpful

I've had a change in manager in the six months I've been at the company and the whole process was managed really smoothly. I have huge respect for the management and the way that the department functions with AE's and SE's. Support through COVID and having to work from home 5 weeks after starting was amazing. There was financial supporting in getting home office equipment and there were plenty of resources made available to ensure mental and physical health through lockdown. These resources are still in place now (daily wellbeing sessions, email updates and weekly leadership sessions to name but a few).",- There is never enough time in the week to learn everything and it can sometimes be overwhelming to try and get up to speed on the products (particularly when the company is buying new companies all the time and creating products for the market to deal with COVID workplace issues in addition).,1 person found this review helpful

Now the narrative has slipped into a sense of window dressing for the media and the market which shines through in several ways: Time tracking and process adherence seems to have taken over every corner of the company. A few years ago you felt that you were encourage to be innovative and to spend time on deep level analysis. Now you have to justify every hour of your day and not necessarily to to the benefit of the customer. Turning more Oracle than Google. Work load pressure is immense and there is an increasing number of people on long term sick leave due to stress. Managers are very often in a different location to you and there is very little awareness of the difficulty this can pose around communication, a sense of overwhelm and time available. HR does not have a presence in the smaller countries. This affects the health of both staff and relations as employees do not know who to turn to for a ‘sanity check’ conversation if a situations arise. HR processes are clearly there to support management and protect the company. There is a lot of talk about the feedback culture but the reality is that constructive criticism only works with few of the managers. Overall the sense is that the many hires from Microsoft, Oracle and similar has begun to take over the company mindset.

The company endlessly trumpets its supposed wonderfulness to the point where it feels like working in an endless commercial. There seems to be a huge push to constantly market the company both externally *and* internally; having the 'culture' shoved down our throats constantly. The company seems to spend an awful lot of money on fluffy extras (like pillows for all employees to put their mobile phones on at their desks, and professionally produced promotional videos for internal-only items) whilst asking employees not to use Roaming Data whilst abroad on business, and only allowing VPs to fly comfortably (some are more equal than others in this Ohana). PR touts Salesforce as a cutting edge company, but back-office systems are ancient and technology stacks are not integrated after years - there is a big disconnect between PR and reality, but the 'Ohana' papers over the cracks. Every All Hands address starts with 10 minutes of pom-pom waving cheerleading about how amazing we are. It gets tiresome.",29 people found this review helpful

204,Bullying amongst female employees a HUGE problem,"Apr 2, 2020 - Director in Toronto, ON",2.0,Competitive salaries Ability to progress within company Volunteering opportunities,"I had a wonderful experience working with Salesforce for the first 3 years of my employment there. However, for the 18 months that followed, my life was made hell. I am so disappointed to say that this was a result of constant bullying from female employees. I had been cursed at and shouted at by a senior female leader repeatedly and in front of other employees, and when reported this to my director was told that there was nothing he could do as she was a VP. This went on for a year. There was extreme and constant bullying, negativity and back-stabbing from females in the US Marketing department, so much so that when a colleague went to interview for that department, the Head of Marketing told her they were having lots of problems on the team with bullying and back-stabbing etc, and was it something she would be able to deal with (the answer to which was obviously no). This type of bullying just became the norm, and was totally accepted. My own first line manager, who was also female, was incapable of giving any type of constructive or positive feedback, particularly to female members of the team, would openly speak negatively about senior leaders in a team meeting setting and was regularly described as being extremely de-motivating by all team members. Again when reported to more senior leadership nothing at all was done about this. I would regularly end my day in tears, spending more time trying to ward off this bullying than being able to focus on my actual work. All of this was documented to my director, and to Employee Services however nothing was done about it. My director would speak with me maybe once every 3-4 months, so I was subjected to bullying by my manager and made to cope with this by myself. My mental health, sleep, appetite and general well-being suffered dramatically and when I mentioned this to my director he told me that I should just go to Employee Services, he also asked if maybe I was having personal issues. Again, my first few years with Salesforce were great, I had amazing team members, male and (amazing) female leaders in Ireland and Canada. However working with management and marketing dept in the US was an entirely different experience and in the end proved to be unbearable. I was stuck in a horrible situation for far too long, with no support or outlet, totally isolated and unable to seek guidance from management. I do hope something is done about the widespread and consistent bullying that is carried out by female employees in the US offices, particularly with regard to the infamously volatile and toxic Marketing Department.",21 people found this review helpful

232,It’s changed,,3.0,There are some pros for Salesforce but most of them lie in benefits and compensation. Certainly this is one of the better paying companies in Toronto particularly in the non-sales world. Yes there are also snacks etc if you like that sort of thing and are drawn to it. It’s also nice that when you leave you can put Salesforce on the resume. Nobody can say that’s not a good thing.,"There’s a lack of trust in some leadership. Coaching is at a minimum. Having had roughly 9 managers in my tenure, I’ve had only two who have provided feedback to help me grow. That’s not a very good ratio. My current one’s response when asked after a customer meeting with an executive was “I’ll let you know if you’re doing something wrong”. That’s not in any way helpful. It’s impossible that I’ve done everything right in one of those meetings and I expect feedback to help me grow. I’m not asking for my hand to be held. I’m asking for guidance. Something you expect from your leader. The office can be quite clique-y and you have to fight your way in. Not quite the Ohana people hear about from the CEO.",12 people found this review helpful

237,Do your due diligence and put some thought into Salesforce before joining,,2.0,"1. The Salesforce Platform is actually awesome and can be integrated into just about any business in some capacity. 2. Pretty good benefits although they are pretty standard for a tech company. 3. Office snacks and drinks are good, although many tech companies offer their employees catered lunch which Salesforce doesn't. 4. There are a lot of intelligent sales people that you can learn a lot from. 5. You get more leniency on working from home the more senior the sales role you are in.","-The Salesforce recipe is to grow and split territories and squeeze every rep as much as they can. This is how they report double-digit growth every year to their investors. -You are compensated the same irrespective of the products you sell, however, management only cares about the core products you sell (Sales/Service Cloud). To the outside world this may not make sense, however, you are looked down upon and will get performance managed if you are not selling enough of these core products. I'm not a lawyer but this doesn't sound legal under Canadian labour law. -“Teacher’s Pet” Culture - Majority of reps (80%) don’t hit their quota but you can still get promoted and have your career accelerated if you play the “game” and suck up to management. -Colleagues who have been here for a while say it used to be an exciting, fun company and now it’s far more corporate and there are a lot of unhappy people in the office.",18 people found this review helpful

269,At the end Customer Success and Ohana is purely marketing,,1.0,You are part of the Ohana (family) until the day they don't need you,"I was debating whether to post this because I know it won't make a difference. But in the end, I decide to post this because I feel the need to share what we went through. Last month, Salesforce laid off a good number of customer success group members, including myself. I don't know the exact % or number, but it is not a small percentage. People will likely think I am negative toward the company because I got layoff. And you are right, who wouldn't be. Over the years, I truly believe in Salesforce and put lots of heart and soul into the company. This sudden layout is not fun and now gave me lots of uncertainty about my career and how do I support my family going forward. Salesforce talked a lot about Trust and Ohana, but this move killed both ideas for me. Where is the Trust when Salesforce let us go when the company is doing well and continue to hire many other roles. Where is the Ohana when Salesforce management cares purely about the books than the well being of the employee. Salesforce will say they are assisting those of us impacted to find another role internally. But the reality is there is little help, we are on our own to find a new position. There are some great people internally trying to help, but they are doing it on their own and not because Salesforce management asked them to. Many other hiring managers wouldn't even give us the chance or response to us. I do not blame other Salesforce Ohana not sensitive to what happened to us, it didn't happen to them, so they do not feel our pain. The bottom line is Salesforce put the books over employees which is the opposite of everything Salesforce stand for and claim to be..",28 people found this review helpful

282,Slowly sliding into a bad place to be..,"Aug 22, 2017 - Sales Executive in London, England",3.0,"- Get to work with some super smart people, however, this talent pool is slowly dwindling. - Free food and drinks. - Can be flexible with working hours - as longs as your results are there. - Excellent product/solution which brings amazing value to the customers - hence amazing customer advocacy. - Salesforce 1 London and Dreamforce is a flagship event and great to be part of. - If you can make it here, it's great for your CV and future employment, as Salesforce is seen as a good company to hire from. - Great benefits, £100 for Gym, Private Health etc.","- Mid-Management have prominently been promoted through the business from the Dublin SMB hub, and therefore lack basic management skills, and typically are more concerned about managing up and their careers over yours. - Very little internal personal or professional development. - Each Sales team does their own things (Forecasts/meetings, etc), with very little synergy or combined learning. Which has fostered a very ugly competitive and back-handed culture - with lack of trust a core problem throughout the UK, especially when dealing with US colleagues. - Lots of very talented people, from all aspects, Marketing, Product, and Sales have left the business, with their replacements (typically Graduates) lacking the basic skills.",10 people found this review helpful

296,Best Company I have ever worked for,,5.0,The job is amazing and interesting and you don't ever get bored. Salary and Benefits are the best I have ever had.

297,Worst nightmare ever,,1.0,"-The product is amazing, nothing to say against. -The sales cycle is interest, many things to learn every day. -I want to believe that your experience and opinion about the company depends on the team you’ll be working in. -Health insurance and 5k to spend on a course per year. -Plenty of opportunities to grow.","-You basically can’t trust people in your own team cause they will find the way to steal your accounts and opportunities. -People are selfish and self-focused, they won’t help you unless they will get something in return. -If you are an Account Executive and you want to spend time with an SDR, you will be judged cause they hate each other (worse than a kindergarten). -No balance at all between work life and private life: you are asked to work at weekends, work at night after entire days in the office, work during bank holidays (well, bank holidays are not allowed). Allowed to take days off only in August and February. In some teams like mine you can’t even work from home. -You have to travel abroad 3/4 times per month and they want you to take flights at dawn or at night cause “you can’t lose working hours”. -One of the best values is volunteering - guess what? Underestimated and not taken for real in my team. -Managers only care about numbers, you are not a person at all. -People underestimate people working in other companies cause they feel they are the best but they are so poor and sad inside. -If people leave cause they feel bad, the other “teammates” and managers will make fun of them. -Micromanagement: your manager will expect to be cc’d in every single email you send to your customers.",25 people found this review helpful

300,Fantastic place to work!,,5.0,"The three years I've worked for Salesforce within the ECS team have been the most impactful and enjoyable of my career. I work in a diverse team both culturally and cognitively, with over 13 different nationalities represented. There is a true feeling of family within the team, who are motivated, coachable and a true representation of the Salesforce Ohana values. I honestly look forward to coming to work everyday, to be part of the fantastic office atmosphere and contributing to something special. The leadership team have a brilliant ability to shape an effective go to market strategy and disseminate to the sales team, enabling consistent and immaculate execution. It's an exciting, fast moving business to work in with endless opportunities to develop and progress. The coaching is first class and whilst I develop professionally I'm also given the opportunity to give back to the community by volunteering my time to meaningful causes. It would be remiss of me to not mention here Zahid Jiwa, who leads the UK ECS team and has built something very special. He encapsulates the Salesforce core values and his team is a true representation of this. The impact he has had on my career has been profound.","It's a fast moving company so be prepared for change, which also brings lots of new opportunities",2 people found this review helpful

315,Hostile Work Climate in ESMB Team,,2.0,There are tons of great volunteering activities and budget for education (even if only few use this as they cannot afford to prepay the money or are unable to take the time off) Salesforce offers great resources and training to develop selling skills. Great products which make the interactions with the clients very rewarding. The team mates are nice and fun even tough there is little actual team spirit and everyone rather fends for themselves.,"Micromanagement: We have WEEKLY targets which fist of all requires Sales reps to justify themselves every week and exerts unnecessary pressure to close deals to unrealistic timelines which is damaging the client relationship. This also leads to non-stop pressure on a weekly basis which leaves no time to regenerate after a stressful month-end. While we are free to structure our days as we wish there are countless data points collected in the CRM which is used as a tool by management to exert additional pressure. Management style: We are not treated like professionals but more like interns who are here to learn and need to proof we are worthy of doing the job we are hired for. There is nothing more important than closing as many deals as possible as quickly as possible. Based on this all decisions are made disregarding the client relationship, the professional opinion of the sales rep or the health and the wellbeing of the rep. Unrealistic goals: Quotas are set unrealistically and only a handful of people are going to make their targets this year. On a bad month you go home with 2000 Euro which does not leave you much to live with an average room rent of 1200 Euro. Two of the teammates even live in camper vans.",31 people found this review helpful
