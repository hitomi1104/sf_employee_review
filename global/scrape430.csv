0,6 Months In . . .,,5.0,I work with some of the smartest people I've ever met. The overall attitude is one of work hard/play hard but not soul crushing. Management in my chain at least does a really good job of making sure not to overload anyone with to much work and makes it a point to get feedback about work/life balance every other week at the end of sprints. Not to repeat to much other information but benefits overall are very good and compensation seems to be top of market.,"Getting up to speed takes time. Internally teams operate very differently and everyone has their own process to intake work which makes for a frustrating experience trying to interact with other teams. I will say with a company with such great overall culture, internally there is definitely a lack of willingness to help other teams. This may be from the large percentage of A+ players driving their own initiatives?",2 people found this review helpful

4,The Best Company Ever!,,5.0,"At Salesforce there is an environment focused around empowerment and education. Employees are given several tools for success. Everything from Trailhead (an online learning resource), to one's team members, employee success, and documented policies and procedures all allow for new employees to learn their new role and easily transition to the company. Employee benefits are wonderful and it's very clear Salesforce puts employees first. There's even food in ever break room so no one ever has to sit at work hungry. All employees are given VTO, which is time off to volunteer for whatever charitable cause they choose. Salesforce also matches charitable donations up to a certain amount. Overall this is an amazing employee focused company. In addition to being a company that takes care of employees, Salesforce also takes care of the community and encourages employees to do the same.",None - This company really is amazing!,Be the first to find this review helpful

14,Depends on your department,,3.0,"Salesforce, as a whole, is by far the best company I could wish to work for. It was my dream company to work for, mainly because of the culture. Beyond the in-house perks, there’s the 56 hours a year we are given to volunteer and give back in pretty much anyway you see fit. The benefits are superior to any company I’ve worked for. The buildings are a pleasure to work in each day. They focus on wellness and striking a good work-life balance. And in all earnesty, want to, and do give back to our communities.","Unfortunately, all of the above is not available across the board. My manager has, short of explicitly saying it, told us we can only volunteer 15 hours a year, to create only one career development goal, “he doesn’t care what it is”, rolls his eyes at the thought of us taking advantage of the company’s championed cause of meditation, told us we aren’t allowed to take ANY time off for a six month period every single year. And to top it off, he’s the biggest micromanager I have ever worked for in my career. You better be the first one there, and last to leave, finishing work at home doesn’t “count”. And not once, has he ever complimented or commended any of us. Doctor appointment? Have a family commitment during the week? Better not make a habit of it. God forbid you have something going on that requires frequent doctor visits. If we want to grow our skill sets via Trailhead, better do it after hours or on the weekend. Mind you, I talk to other people in the company and they are appalled that this is happening. My ratings are based on my specific experience, and do not represent the typical Salesforce experience. I thought it was just him, and some of it certainly is, but the whole department is toxic. There’s turnover left and right, every couple of weeks it seems another coworker chooses to leave the company. And if the VP cared, they would do something. It’s blatant. I have thought of raising the issue to HR but it’s obvious these people have been here a long time, and make someone above them happy, so it’s pointless.",23 people found this review helpful

They tell you to pat yourself on the back because ""its harder to get into Salesforce than Harvard""... people repeat this at bootcamp, when they didn't even attend Harvard. Training is all online Trailhead badges, and not personal training with objection handling, interaction and just a bunch of ""Salesforce is the best and the competitor sucks"", their management and team breeds arrogance, ignorance and lack of humanity. Salesforce is all smoke and mirrors, great place to work, but their sales teams all stab eachother in the back. Try asking people about the relationships between EMEA and NorthAmerica on accounts. They claim #1 place to work but ask around, people get sick of being a cog in the corporate system.

Teamwise, I know some interns who weren't as lucky as me and ended up in teams who barely interacted outside of work (i.e. no eating together during lunch).

The company did away with formal performance reviews a few years ago. There is a culture of praise here, so constructive feedback is rarely given - Roles and teams are incredibly silo'd now. This is not the place to be if you're looking to grow and develop your career in a multitude of different ways - Easy to get lost in the sea of things: the company has grown way too large in recent years - Growth and progression are slow. Career development is non-existent if you remain in your current position. Since there are so many employees now, each job that an employee has is incredibly specific, so if you want a change of pace, you'd have to change out of your role entirely Also, for what it's worth, I strongly believe that Salesforce actively reaches out to news outlets and pays to get on those ""Best Employer"" lists that come out yearly.

291,Hybrid Engineering is causing chaos,,3.0,Great company culture. Good work life balance. Smart developers with good problem solving skills. Great career growth opportunities. Planning of work is better than most other companies that I have come across.,"Hybrid Engineering has pros and cons. However, in Indy, the strategy for hybrid transition is causing a significant loss in engineering productivity. First, Pros: 1.) Hybrid engineering has brought more focus on using contemporary tools for automated testing. 2.) This helps in improving system reliability and make developers better at their jobs since testing is not considered an afterthought anymore. 3.) Huge investment in automated testing upfront is a good overall strategy that will help in system scalability and reduce buggy software releases. Cons: 1.) The idea for depending more on automated testing than on manual testing has translated into demanding all manual / semi manual qa testers to learn how to code. 2.) This is the strategy that has not panned out at all. While, the self help tools like online courses, mentoring resources and in-team guidance have been a proactive ongoing effort, this approach is taking massive hits on productivity for developers as well as for testers all around. 3.) You can find developers on any given day spending quite a bit of time (hours at times) going over basic step by step process (over and over again) with the testers to resolve minority non-mission critical bugs. 4.) Testers, especially who are not from a programming background / havent coded in a while, are overwhelmed and stressed out about the tickets they have to complete each sprint. 5.) For a company that champions engineering productivity and no interruption time for developers, developers are spending less time on quality features/innovative/disruptive work and more time getting bogged down by the process+manual testing+ incremental work . Dont get me wrong, the notion of ohana is embedded deep in the organization and engineers are glad to help their peers anytime. However, this is a massive hit on productivity.",9 people found this review helpful
