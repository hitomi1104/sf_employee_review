Organization is changing fast, there are opportunities to move Internal mobility is a core value.","In short: - Total compensation package less attractive than @ first sight - Sales Territory subject to change any time, any way. - Heavily Political - Poor Management - Little diversity (in terms of skills, background and genre) Management is surprisingly immature for a 10.000 people company, nobody really cares about you, numbers is all that matters. As such the aim of management is only hitting the number, no matter what. Meaning: no resource development, little training, harsh treatment when something goes wrong, no coaching, no understanding whatsoever. Numbers arrive, you're a star. They don't, you're an a***ole. The internal mantra is SFDC wants to innovate, unlike Oracle these days. Yet 50% of the people come from Oracle and they keep coming. Be very careful about what you are told at the interview. The territory assigned wil almost surely change after a few months, for the good (unlikely) or the bad (very much likely). Base pay is high (variable is becoming more and more difficult to hit and beat) but benefits are quite limited with respect to other IT companies. If evaluated in overall package the comparison is less favourable than originally thought bringing it to on par with other major IT employer. Also, the environment is pretty political: hiring is based on who you know, internally and externally, not on what you do and what you can achieve and not always the two aspects lead to the same point. As such relations are valued more than skills. Kind of : so is life but if you expect something different....",6 people found this review helpful

211,salesforce.com,"Aug 18, 2009 - Consultant in Dublin, Dublin",4.0,"Good salary, good team, very exciting product and platform to work with. Company is cutting edge and progressive (in technical terms rather than corporate terms). Possible to advance on merit","Work life balance in services non-existent. Company grew too fast to keep up with the great team dynamic that made it such a creative, exciting, progressive place to work. US did not understand non-US jurisdictions and had not desire to do so.

217,Fabulous to to work in a company with such amazing momentum on the leading edge of technology!,"Oct 21, 2008 - Director in London, England",5.0,Some of the cleverest people in the industry work at salesforce.com. It's very refreshing to be able to learn constantly from my peers and my VP. I feel challenged ever day and I learn something new every day. My time at salesforce will set me up for success in whatever I choose to do in the future. The tribal IQ at salesforce.com makes everyone step it up several levels!,"I could work 24 hours a day and I would still have stuff on my list to do! If you are a 9-5 kind of person - you won't like it at salesforce.com - you wouldn't keep up with the speed everything moves at and you would be left behind. The flip side is that when I go to the gym at 10am because I have a space in the diary - its absolutely ok. I enjoy the hard working, high achieving culture even if it means being switched on 23/6.",3 people found this review helpful

219,Dream. Deliver. Succeed.,"Oct 18, 2008 - in London, England",5.0,"There are very few companies where you have a real opportunity to change the world, to work with some of the smartest and most dedicated people on the planet, and where your customers will be proud of you, clap you on the back, and tell everyone they know to use your product - salesforce.com is one of them. Rarely does a week go by when I am not astonished by the quality of the people I work with. The company is relentlessly focused on customer success. This focus is real, and not just a marketing message. The product itself is hands-down the best business application I have ever used. The salesforce.com foundation is just plain cool and makes me proud.","No company is perfect. Salesforce.com isn't for everyone. The pace is relentless. It's a rocket-ride. But the flipside of that is that everyone is driving in the same direction and everyone knows the mission. For people who already think they know how things should be done, who understand how real companies operate, who learned their lessons in a prior decade and think they can come and bring these ideas to help salesforce.com ""grow-up"" - they usually feel like they are banging their heads into a wall. Everyone who joins starts by starting over - learning some of the fundamentals that make the company different, and IMHO better than the traditional software or technology companies.",2 people found this review helpful
