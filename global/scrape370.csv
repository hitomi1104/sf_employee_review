4,Just another cog in the tech machine. You don't matter.,,1.0,"Benefits, meeting other unhappy colleagues who helped me during my terrible experience at Salesforce","Another tech giant trying to spread the company culture kool aid but doesn’t recognize or address terrible leaders and managers or self appointed “lead EAs”. Very toxic, backstabbing politics going on amongst executive assistants which creates an entire group of disgruntled, distrustful, and power hungry EAs and makes most EAs carry a bad reputation at Salesforce. Execs and managers who have EAs: some of them need serious management training and learn how to treat everyone under them fairly. This was by far some of the worst treatment I’ve ever seen from an exec who had an EA. Micromanaging, having other people spy on the EA and report back to him about the EA's whereabouts and movement.. The EA was treated like a prisoner. Also, there are some EAs who support C-level people and they act as if they are the exec's themselves. They wield their execs' status for their own power and control over others. It's ridiculous and I don't know if the execs who have EAs even know that their EAs are doing this. I hated working with any execs who had EAs. It was always a massive hinderance to my work progress. I don't understand Salesforce and the EA culture.. some are really great EAs but some are terrible and unfortunately they are the EAs at the top.. usually supporting SVP and up. I wouldn’t buy into their culturally appropriated “OHANA” and other Hawaiian sayings. It’s all a facade.",22 people found this review helpful

Some people thrive in one environment or the other, but Salesforce seems to have a little of both.

Yeah, that describes the intensity.","The executive leadership team at Salesforce exemplifies the values they espouse and they truly believe that the world can be changed by business. Unfortunately, the values that are core to our belief system (doing what's right for the customer, trust, etc.) do not filter down to the actual sales process. There's a tendency to encourage customers to do things unnatural to their buying process, all in the interest of making the month. You will subjected to immense pressure here. The company, to their credit, has tried to emphasize wellness with meditation rooms in each office, etc. But much like volunteer time off, I know very few sales people that have time to enjoy those perks outside of offsites. With only 50% of AEs exceeding plan, your success depends entirely on timing and territory. AEs who have not missed their number in years come to Salesforce only to fail because the alchemy involved in assigning quotas. There's a reason why so many AEs turn over after less than 2 years.

With our diverse product set, the list of what a CORE SE is supposed to know grows constantly with insufficient specialist support. I'm a high performer in terms of ACV, but since our comp is more weighted towards team goals I'd rather have a life than have the extra few bucks. I've been asking for help all year, but hiring hasn't kept up with attrition on the team so its getting worse rather than better. I think management does care, but it takes so long to hire and onboard new SEs it takes 3-6 months to get any relief.

The rate of growth at times creates confusion and certainly poses organizational and system challenges. Salesforce is future focused and perhaps doesn't always take the time to look back to evaluate past performance, instead preferring to move on to the next big thing. The result is that sub-optimal processes don't always get corrected. As the company has grown, a lack of focus on small details results in some areas of the business suffering until something serious occurs that draws attention to it. Salesforce is unabashedly a Customer Company. When given the choice to pivot to Customers, Shareholders, or Employees, the company will always choose Customers.

My work feels important and my interactions with Salesforce customers and employees are unmistakably friendly and unmistakably Salesforce.","Like at any enterprise tech company, the work is big and complex. With responsibility over projects that affect hundreds to thousands of people, balancing work priorities and personal life can feel a bit rocky at times. Fortunately, there is always a bright mind to turn to for help and no shortage of motivated, hard-working people around you to get the job done and have a little fun while doing it.",Be the first to find this review helpful

62,You're not going to find a better culture.... BUT,,4.0,"Great place to work, so challenging, inspiring, educational, potential to earn huge money, not much negative to say here.","BUT... The three T's applies here... Territory, Timing and Talent. Salesforce deliberately assign miniature territories and switch them up annually. It forces reps to be hungry, desperate even when you only have a year to close the account. Heaven forbid one of the two accounts that you are assigned goes bankrupt/is acquired/has a spending freeze that year... you're going to sit on the sidelines for a year and hope that you get a decent account the following year in the 'Carve'. If that doesn't work out... you're gone. I've seen literally dozens of top performers getting turfed due to this circumstance. Sales is a rough game sometimes and it's brutal at Saleforce.

News flash: people are different in different parts of the country and the rest of the world. Company needs to just admit they are the same as other giant corporations. - No longer feels like a innovative/entrepreneurial/start-up company (Now we just buy those kinds of companies, even if it doesn't make sense. I'm looking at you Quip.) - The company has never told a customer no, even when they needed to do so and the company is feeling it - Company seems to reward bad client behavior instead of correcting it - I am tired of typing but there are definitely more cons than pros",25 people found this review helpful

High pay, though they don't have as frequent stock refreshes as other large tech companies.","Sort of bizarre workplace environment & culture. I didn't see much in the way of manager training or ensuring that the right ICs were promoted to people manager roles. Annual reviews are in no-way transparent. You are assessed on a set of criteria that is not shared with you (either the criteria or the assessment results). My review was five minutes: ""You're doing great!"" There was no actionable feedback, stretch goals or written documentation for me to learn and grow from. Leadership in my org very often resorted to bullying and openly shared negative feedback on their own peers with their reports. Several times while working there, I lost my engineering title due to re-orgs and was told that they ""didn't want to transfer headcount,"" so was left with only limited technical work to do for long stretches. And that's my biggest complaint - at least in my org, hard and innovative work was not championed but rather avoided in pursuit of very easy and short-term goals.",22 people found this review helpful
71,Be careful that they follow through on what they promise.,"Oct 12, 2008 - Senior Account Executive: Mid Market in San Francisco, CA",2.0,Great software applications and tremendous potential of SaaS.,The territories are treated as though they each have the same sales potential with each having the same quota. Though in reality the territories are not the same and each year the territories get smaller and smaller while the the quota rises. The company is satisfied with having only 55% achieve their quotas and qualify for club because they don't expect 45% of the reps to attain their quotas. So 45% of the reps are set up for failure. They also bait and switch territories as a way to attract talent. They make you a job offer for a particular territory only to tell you after you have been hired and left your previous job that your territory has changed...and typically the new territory is not of the same caliber and potential of what was promised. Also when a new sales rep joins the company they find that their territory has been cherry picked by several reps on their sales team each having hold outs preventing you from selling into these accounts for up to 90 days. And there is no quota relief for this lost revenue potential.,13 people found this review helpful
72,Nearly Homeless,"Apr 28, 2015 - Marketing Manager in San Francisco, CA",1.0,Great peers and colleagues. I made lots of friends here in the 7 years I was with the company. Great external PR and positioning.,"No loyalty. I was an employee for nearly 7 years. Every year I received a stellar performance review, a good raise and bonus, and more stock. I even won awards for innovation and developing new ways to work. At one point it ""was"" a great place to work. In late 2013, I got a new manager. She made lots of comments about wanting people on her team who were ""young and hungry"". I turned 58 last year and assume I just got too old for her and the company. She eliminated my job, told me it wasn't personal, gave me a 6 week severance package and sent me on my way. Now, after 15 months of unemployment, I've lost my house, am living in my car and desperately trying to find a job. I had a great career that was ruined by this manager. HR let it happen knowing what a good employee I was. They just wanted to make my manager happy. For all their claims of being socially conscious and their philanthropic work, they certainly didn't care about me. The company is very calculated in their claims about promoting women. Right before I left, they had terminated at least 12 female VP's. Some were replaced with men.",49 people found this review helpful
73,Account Executive - Amazing Experience!,"Jun 18, 2018 - Mid-Commercial Account Executive in Tampa, FL",5.0,"Started working at Salesforce about 2-months ago! Absolutely amazing experience from the interview process, hiring, trainings/enablements and the list goes on. Salesforce is a place where they, hands-down, take care of their employees and customers. I'm shocked at how well they go above and beyond for their employees and feel grateful to be at such a great company! Coming from smaller start-up types of companies, I was worried that moving to a huge company would be difficult and I'd feel like a robot BUT Salesforce has a similar feel to a start-up, placing you in smaller teams of people that you work alongside.","Being a remote employee I wish we had dedicated monthly times to take trips to work/meet with your team!

74,Marketing Cloud Sales AE,"Dec 14, 2016 - Senior Account Executive in Indianapolis, IN",3.0,"Marketing Cloud offers a ton of great solutions. They are (mostly) fully integrated, which many competitors can't say, and the individual solutions are leaders in their respective areas. The former ExactTarget culture still exists to an extent but is fading over time. Marketing is a growing area in most companies, so there is plenty of room for growth. Being a part of Salesforce is a benefit from a company values perspective. The 1-1-1 model makes me proud to work for an organization that gives back.","New AE product enablement is embarrassingly bad. The first 12 months are sink or swim, and aside from self-enabling yourself, the territories are hit or miss. Sales reps that have crushed their quota at other companies often struggle due to poor territory carves and slow enablement ramp time. Furthermore, Marketing Cloud basically acts as its own company within Salesforce. Collaboration with the CRM business is weak at best, and Marketing Cloud's biggest competitor has been its own internal solution, Pardot. Last, sales managers here are mostly just that, managers. True leaders in management are few and far between. For example, struggling AEs are mostly on their own to figure it out, which is resulting in higher AE turnover.",9 people found this review helpful
75,Increasingly Toxic and Biased Environment,"Mar 4, 2019 - Manager in San Francisco, CA",1.0,"Salesforce is a nice place to work to retire. It has good benefits, especially the wellness reimbursement and the ESPP (Salesforce stock is pretty good), and it's difficult to get fired (this may vary by department).","Management is full of hyprocrisy. Salesforce's core values include things like transparency and equality, both of which have been completely ignored on our team (and apparently also on other teams after reading other reviews here). There is a complete lack of communication from the top down, which makes our team unable to perform our work well. Furthermore, there is little feedback on how we can get promotions or raises. There is a culture of not giving feedback and you need to ""read between the lines"" in order to know what feedback there is (this is what was told to me by management). On our team, promotions are given to the men more often than the women, and men with the same title and less experience as women have higher salaries. Also, the skill of managing people isn't seen as part of the requirements of being a people manager. A lot of people who are great individual contributors get promoted to Manager and aren't very good at their new job of dealing with their direct reports, but upper management doesn't care. Work life balance is also not very flexible during busy season (which lasts from October through March).",42 people found this review helpful

I'd also say: - Competitive Pay - ESPP program - Fun people - Office downtown SF - The coffee shops - Company events,"The Ohana culture is wonderful but unfortunately it's not practiced by many leaders. They don't reward good leadership and embodying the culture. I had heard it was the influx of the Oracle culture - and the sad part is we talked a lot about how important the culture was but we didn't hold senior leadership for it...so there was a lot of bad behavior (yelling, bullying, not allowing work/life balance, etc) . Felt a lot like it was all for PR and branding but not really what was valued or practiced.

The company did away with formal performance reviews a few years ago. There is a culture of praise here, so constructive feedback is rarely given - Roles and teams are incredibly silo'd now. This is not the place to be if you're looking to grow and develop your career in a multitude of different ways - Easy to get lost in the sea of things: the company has grown way too large in recent years - Growth and progression are slow. Career development is non-existent if you remain in your current position. Since there are so many employees now, each job that an employee has is incredibly specific, so if you want a change of pace, you'd have to change out of your role entirely Also, for what it's worth, I strongly believe that Salesforce actively reaches out to news outlets and pays to get on those ""Best Employer"" lists that come out yearly. I wouldn't be surprised if they had people in HR write numerous positive reviews to artificially inflate the Glassdoor scores.",14 people found this review helpful

114,Want PTSD - Work for Salesforce,,1.0,Plush office space Snacks Nice view from the upper floors,"Salesforce is the most toxic organization I have ever worked for, and I've worked for a lot of organizations as both an FTE, contractor, and consultant over the past two decades. Trying to pare down what I want to warn others of is difficult. I'll just bullet it out and you can decide what would wear you down, disrupt your sleep, and leave you paranoid, the most. - 1:1s with senior management where the most hateful things are said about your character, etc., and then afterward, the manager acts as though it never happened. -Pressure to give Salesforce a glowing Glassdoor rating after less than 30 days at the company when you do not know enough to provide an accurate review. - No written reviews, something called a 9 box where management provides their opinion of you and tells you it exists but then says you are never allowed to see it, per H/R. - If you want to apply for an internal position, you must have your manager's permission first. If you tell your manager you want to apply for the role and he/she does not want to lose you, he/she just says, no, you do not have my permission. Game over, you are going no where. - If you are allowed a desk (many have to submit to hoteling and never knowing where they will sit day to day), no personal plants, photos, or non SF toys allowed. They want a uniform look to the desks. -Forced volunteerism, if you do not log your 50 hour minimum of volunteer hours per year, you will be shamed at team meetings. Doesn't matter if you have kids, sick parents, 60 hour work week, whatever, you are expected to make the minimum. -No criticism of Benioff permitted. And don't ever say out loud that you found it disturbing to see a laying on of hands and someone praying over him as though he were a prophet at an internal company meeting. Management will quickly remind you that he is leading the 4th industrial revolution and he is the leading mind of our time. -If you are managing young hourly employees, be prepared to be instructed that you are to tell them they MUST go to team dinners, volunteer events, and SF ""fun"" activities but this is not work, so they don't get paid. If you push back, you will be reprimanded for ""not being Ohana."" - Teams are run by popularity. Backstabbing, shaming, and shunning are used to get the teams to stay quiet about how bad things are. People who speak out about behaviors, lack of professionalism, etc. are labeled, ""unOhana"" and told that they are not acting like family. - When you interview and you take a position, there is ZERO guarantee that the role you interviewed for and were hired for is the role you will be doing. The management opinion is to hire highly qualified people, they will be so grateful to be permitted to work at Salesforce, they will do whatever job we give them. I kid you not, you may have more than a decade of experience, be highly technical, have managed teams, and be hired for a technical role, then be told you are going to do data entry level work and you will be glad you are permitted to be at this company doing that. -If you are uncomfortable participating in some public events, e.g. parades, events, etc., and SF is participating in one, there is incredible pressure to spend your weekend in the parade or event. The expectation is that Salesforce and its needs come first. I cannot stress this enough, you are told that Salesforce is YOUR family and your family comes first.

The people are great and their is a real team environment. People really want to help and do the best for the team and the customer. I've never seen another company close to this. Salesforce also follows a model that donates 1% of revenue, 1% of time and 1% of product to charity. As an employee, I get 5 days of Volunteer Time Off and charitable donation matches. It's also super easy for me as an employee to get that match and log VTO time. Salesforce is setting the bar in this space along with Patagonia. Salesforce is also trying to be sustainable and is a carbon-neutral cloud. . No other company can say that. Compensation aside this company is a 7 on a scale of 1-5.","That said the compensation is a quagmire of BS. First you can already expect an OTE significantly less than what is the norm in the industry. Worse still is the 40 acts of vaudeville to figure out if you will get paid, if you get paid and what amount they base it on. We are out there saying use Salesforce as your system of record and every month my Xactly has little similarity to my sales in Salesforce. Come on, guys. Let's not be hypocrites! Then when you think it can get no worse there is a virtual rubics cube of ways you lose ACV or see $ clawed back. You have to be an accountant to figure out if you can sell to an account and retire quota. It's ridiculous how many times, in a short time I have not gotten the full value of my sale due to some arbitrary attrition I was not even aware of as a co-prime. Do you want me to sell or do you want me to audit the accounts to see if I can retire quota with a sale?",14 people found this review helpful

They choose to talk only to others on the team of the same race as them and only promote those individuals - Your work will be stolen by more senior engineers and management won't side with you.

There was no actionable feedback, stretch goals or written documentation for me to learn and grow from. Leadership in my org very often resorted to bullying and openly shared negative feedback on their own peers with their reports. Several times while working there, I lost my engineering title due to re-orgs and was told that they ""didn't want to transfer headcount,"" so was left with only limited technical work to do for long stretches.

Compared to some of the larger tech companies, Salesforce is very streamlined. That pretty much sums it up.","Where do I begin.... *pay is a joke compared to other large SaaS and tech companies. Even if you hit quota, which by the way barely happens. Please, please, please, don’t believe the hype. Less than 20 % of the people hit quota. I think in GRB it’s less than 10% for 2017. Regardless it’s a joke. I’ve worked at other tech companies and I’ve never seem anything so pathetic. *terrible middle management, I mean terrible. Keep in mind this review is coming from someone who was cosidered realtively succssful, and still think this place is a joke. Anyways, I digress.... Middle management for the most part is made up of people who lack leadership skills, talent, experience. It’s actually joke. It’s like a weird cesspool of account executives being promoted to management. One day theyre your peer, the next day, they’re your superior. Not saying they’re racist or anything, but holy hell, talk about 95% Caucasians Being promoted into these roles. Overall, management (based on my experience, observations, talking to peers,etc) literally brings NO value. They just sit at their computer and run reports, show up late to customer meetings, sit awkwardly/quietly in a conference room during a customer call, but during 1on1s (these are also frequent, redundant, waste of time), they offer to sit in on calls/meetings as if They are providing value. If you’re one of the unfortunate suckers/victims to work for Salesforce please please please understand, your entire success, compensation, will be 99% based on the territory handed to you. That’s it point blank. All the other BS, is Just that BS. Run a few reports and you’ll see the top performs get most of their ACV from organic aka gimmes or flips aka warm leads handed to them by the inside biz dev team. Team. Yes, working hard and doing everything the right way (by the book) will give you a very slight edge, but if you’re not handed a fruitful territory you WILL NOT hit quota or make money. Pleeeeasse, please take this as the truth. Again, I was a top 10-20% person, and I’m leaving this review. I could go on and on, but I’ll end it with this. If you’re an experienced sales professional, do NOT work here. You will regret it and regret it fast.

Growing to fast and not able to keep up with overall growth. Seeing lots and lots of angry current customers... 8/10 if you don't have 5-6+ years of inside/outside sales experience, you will only be considered for an SDR or BDR role. This could be fine, but the role should incorporate more closing of business if you are basically expecting people to take a demotion for the role and not articulating the position clearly (this could just be an issue with my office though). If you are on the BDR team you can be the hardest working person and still not hit your number because of how your quota is attained. Your manager will ""help you"" come up with ""strategic plans"" to hit your number (basically just tell you to make more calls/set meetings) but it doesn't matter because if you AEs refuse the meetings, don't feel like moving them to a stage 2 (everyone perceives what this means differently), don't have time to take them until the next month, etc. then you are screwed. BDR management doesn't align with AE management at all. Therefore, they don't care about anything except their AEs closing deals (I don't blame them!), they are annoyed when BDR management comes complaining that their AEs aren't working with their BDR... This is just not a conducive business model and doesn't help growth initiatives. Not everyone is measured the same. You could be aligned 2-4 AEs or 10-15 AEs as a BDR. Either way, these people are expected to generate the same amount of ""stage 2"" opportunity. If you have 2 AEs that are busy, don't work in your office or don't have the ""need"" for a BDR to generate pipeline - then you have NO chance of hitting your quota. SDRs, BDRs and AE's are all expected to generate their own pipeline - which makes sense but it is causing people to compete with each other which takes away from making the customer #1 priority. This is especially bad since the Mulesoft migration... (from BDR POV) Although Salesforce always talks about endless internal growth opportunities, this is def not something that I have seen to be encouraged. You are pretty much forced to take the typical promotion track. BDR Management is way too pushy with BDRs setting new meetings and business, while this should be a significant responsibility, lots of customers get mislead, forgotten, or treated with poor customer service which eventually will backfire (I have already seen it backfire a few times!) As a BDR you could generate $5mil in the pipeline one month, but only have 2 stage two opptys on the board (you need around 6-8)...which means you will miss your quota. Others could have 6-8 opptys on the board which only adds up to $300k in pipe for the month, but they will hit quota.. Doesn't make sense.",14 people found this review helpful

You feel pride working at Salesforce. For the most part leadership is talented.","The media has an image that Salesforce is the number 1 place to work. This is not the case for sales. Many of the sales reps are unhappy with many things but stay because of how well the company performs/innovates. Base salaries are extremely low. There are very few people that are hitting their annual numbers and the overall compensation plus base is just not there. So much of it is based on territory but leaders will say to their graves that all territories are even. We would have much more appreciated it being called out vs. lying to our faces that they are all spread equally. Overall there is a lot of negativity here and much of this stems from the unhappy customers. Salesforce customers, especially in the SMB space don’t have the money to spend to implement Salesforce so their orgs are bad and adoption is extremely low. Account executives are responsible for selling - but also dealing with all unhappy customers, cancellations, technical support questions, etc. It doesn’t help that the renewals and billing teams are both outsourced to foreign counties and are extremely hard to work with (both internally and externally).

I am no longer surprised to receive an email concerning yet another re-org and more VPs moved around and targets changed. Company seems unwilling to make difficult decisions to fix systemic tech issues. In particular, several senior leaders have joined from Microsoft over the last few years. They seem more interested in power moves and self gain than any actually inspiring and making sound decisions. It's a total mess for those doing the actual work.",12 people found this review helpful

Getting a job at Salesforce has been life-altering in many positive ways. I'm proud of my time there.","The relentless focus on 25-30% YoY growth requires that Salesforce maintain a culture of bravado, bluster, and hype - and, too be fair, much of it well deserved. But, in recent years, that same bluster permeates internally creating a more political (and I found threatening) culture. The Solution Engineer role became almost entirely Sales, and very little about technology. 'Art of the possible' is a common refrain. 'Imagineering' is another go-to buzz word. Or, more directly, 'Don't talk about products; paint a vision' is a constant theme.",5 people found this review helpful

258,Good employer that makes themselves look great through extensive marketing,"Feb 16, 2019 - Senior Director in San Francisco, CA",3.0,"If you are in the right business area, maintaining a good work/life balance is very easy. There are some employees spending as much as 50% of their time on volunteer activity - literally logging more than a thousand hours of volunteer time a year. The support that the company offers its employees in times of need is exceptional, and the care and understanding of middle management is genuine. I care for all of my team members well being, and support them personally and professionally as much as possible. So do my colleagues.","Underneath the facade, Salesforce is focused on perception more than reality. VTO isn't volunteer time off at all. It's voluntold time on-top (of existing work load) for most of the company. We have targets for VTO set, but many business units aren't staffed appropriately to actually take the time off. Instead it's just adding work load on top of our existing work load. Also, the company really exemplifies the wealth gap, with those at the top heavily rewarded with expensive trips, awards (including cars, watches, etc.) while the majority of the company is paid somewhere around the 75th percentile of industry. We once had a travel freeze but the company still sent the top 100+ employees to a big shindig in Hawaii - and they broadcast it and insisted that everyone across the company ""tune in"" to it remotely. Wow.",50 people found this review helpful

275,Continues to decline,"Apr 17, 2019 - Consultant in New York, NY",2.0,"The ability to come into the office or work remote, although I have noticed a decline in internal careers listed that are remote. The ability to volunteer using VTO, but agree with others. In some teams it is not volunteer work, you are required to put it in your V2MOM and complete it on some teams. The ability to do interesting work, connect with other talented individuals, and the training/learning opportunities.","On a recent survey, two of the lowest scoring questions revolve around people politicking and backstabbing to get things done and the lowest score company wide was promotions are handled in a fair and transparent way. The promotion question has been a bottom 5 scoring question for 2 years now. I have witnessed people promoted either for unfair reasons or because threatening to leave. They pass off a promotion as someone being promoted when in all actuality they applied to an internal job posting and were hired, that’s not really a promotion. The answer to fixing this is not more documentation on careers. They put on a front that they value trust and transparency. They want you to be able to have difficult conversations with your manager without fear of retaliation, but I have witnessed people who speak up and are retaliated against with maybe a Performance Improvement Plan or a demotion. I sometimes feel as if managers and leaders here are talking the talk but not walking the walk when it comes to truly living by the Ohana values. There is a feeling on some teams that it is easier and less stressful not using your PTO vs using it. Tough finding and training multiple backups to handle their job and yours while out. Recently a decline in billable work that has them reassigning people to new careers. It is tough seeing work sent to vendors in India when people at Salesforce are struggling to get billable work. Bonus for some 100% based on billable work which you have no control over. Person A could have 4 accounts and 40+ billable hours, resulting in a very healthy bonus; while Person B might have 1 account and is receiving 10 hours of work, receiving a much smaller bonus. The division of labor is not fair and should be distributed more evenly. Seems a bit unfair when Salesforce gives an executive a $200,000 car and $86,000 watch as a bonus for exceptional work, when you have witnessed others do exceptional work on a smaller scale (not necessarily bringing in $8 million in Sales) and all they get is a Chatter shoutout from their manager or their name mentioned on a PowerPoint slide. I agree with another review here...it is tough dealing with a travel ban, not being able to travel to visit coworkers during a Christmas party, but the top people were all in Hawaii that year.

People at the company are seemingly fake as well, they give off a pleasant vibe but turn around and trash talk other employees. The work is very bland and the product itself is legacy and uninteresting. There's no room for creativity and innovation at all. I don't understand how Salesforce is at the cutting edge of technology when the product itself is easily reproduced. Benefits and perks are subpar compared to other SF/Bay Area tech, no free lunch, no phone or commuter benefits.",36 people found this review helpful
