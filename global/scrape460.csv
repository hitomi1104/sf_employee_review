2,Best company I’ve worked for!,,5.0,"- As a Solution Engineer, pay is excellent. Bonuses/commissions are for the most part guaranteed especially starting with FY19. Seniors and below get overtime! - 401k match up to $5k - Charity Donation match up to $5k - Fairly priced health insurance with premium options included for dental and eye - 13 holidays a year (includes 4 floating)! - 7 days of Volunteer Time Off - 100 a month for health and fitness subsidy - lots of free swag and giveaway gifts Salesforce is a great corporate citizen with their 1-1-1 pledge. They really do care about helping the community and equality for all. I’m truly proud to work for a great company. Being an SE out of San Francisco, we get the perks of having HQ with the amazing building amenities, cafes, snacks, fitness classes, access to product teams and leadership, technology kiosks, and conferences and marketing events such as Dreamforce, TrailheaDX, summits, and kickoffs. Although it may vary by team when being out of HQ, we still get the flexibility to work remotely which is nice since the SE role can be very demanding. The role continues to challenge me and provide tremendous growth opportunities. In this role I get opportunities to continue to learn new products almost every six months and get certified, improve my public speaking skills, and network with executives from all the customers I work with. I get the perks of traveling (and also get paid for it since I’m hourly) which is different than consulting travel because it’s 2-3 trips a month usually for 1-3 days and mostly localized to the west coast.","- As an SE, we’re often times spread very thin. In addition to pre-sales, we provide booth duty (marketing) and enablement (post sales) support. This leaves us no time to get the real work done, so we use nights and weekends to build and solution. - Marketing is usually 6 months - 1 year ahead of the products themselves. - Our customers love Salesforce but I spend most of my time education customers because they are confused on the products we offer. Putting Einstein and Lightning in front of every product confuses the crap out of everyone including internal employees - 3 weeks vacation for non exempt employees could be better - I often find that in order to use my VTO, I’m working overtime, because my work still needs to get done even if I’m doing volunteer work - Way too many all hands meetings. - Administrative overhead in general is extremely time consuming: time and expense reporting, activities entry, DCs, and administrative quip docs. - Turnover with our AE counterparts can impede on our ability to sell",10 people found this review helpful

5,"Great Company, Great Benefits, but don't work for the Marketing Cloud",,3.0,Salesforce is a world class leader and has many wonderful people and products. Benefits are amazing and the values of the company are so wonderful!,"The problem is that they continue to acquire companies, and within those companies individuals who are less than qualified or do not fit the Salesforce culture also get acquired. If you happen to become apart of one of these products and teams, it's extremely difficult to get out of and Salesforce takes years to fire individuals that desperately need to be removed from the company. Management says that their hands are tied with Employee Success and Employee Success drags their feet, causing teams and clients to suffer dramatically. The Marketing cloud is notorious for this behavior and has an internal reputation from Salesforce Core to not hire individuals that come from the Marketing Cloud due to the individuals that do not represent the company and the Marketing Cloud well.",2 people found this review helpful

Compared to some of the larger tech companies, Salesforce is very streamlined. That pretty much sums it up.","Where do I begin.... *pay is a joke compared to other large SaaS and tech companies. Even if you hit quota, which by the way barely happens. Please, please, please, don’t believe the hype. Less than 20 % of the people hit quota. I think in GRB it’s less than 10% for 2017. Regardless it’s a joke. I’ve worked at other tech companies and I’ve never seem anything so pathetic. *terrible middle management, I mean terrible. Keep in mind this review is coming from someone who was cosidered realtively succssful, and still think this place is a joke. Anyways, I digress.... Middle management for the most part is made up of people who lack leadership skills, talent, experience. It’s actually joke. It’s like a weird cesspool of account executives being promoted to management. One day theyre your peer, the next day, they’re your superior. Not saying they’re racist or anything, but holy hell, talk about 95% Caucasians Being promoted into these roles. Overall, management (based on my experience, observations, talking to peers,etc) literally brings NO value. They just sit at their computer and run reports, show up late to customer meetings, sit awkwardly/quietly in a conference room during a customer call, but during 1on1s (these are also frequent, redundant, waste of time), they offer to sit in on calls/meetings as if They are providing value. If you’re one of the unfortunate suckers/victims to work for Salesforce please please please understand, your entire success, compensation, will be 99% based on the territory handed to you. That’s it point blank. All the other BS, is Just that BS. Run a few reports and you’ll see the top performs get most of their ACV from organic aka gimmes or flips aka warm leads handed to them by the inside biz dev team. Team. Yes, working hard and doing everything the right way (by the book) will give you a very slight edge, but if you’re not handed a fruitful territory you WILL NOT hit quota or make money. Pleeeeasse, please take this as the truth. Again, I was a top 10-20% person, and I’m leaving this review. I could go on and on, but I’ll end it with this. If you’re an experienced sales professional, do NOT work here. You will regret it and regret it fast. If you’re a developer/coder then Salesforce might be a legit landing spot, otherwise look elsewhere.",58 people found this review helpful

81,"A great place to work, but not without its challenges","Feb 9, 2018 - Software Engineer in Indianapolis, IN",5.0,"- Benefits here are incredible. Bonus, stock options (both RSUs and ESPP), generous 401k policy, plenty of PTO, 3 months of paternal leave (even more for mothers), sit/stand desks, free snacks / drinks, free food pretty often - Work/life balance is not perfect but a big step above other companies I have worked for. Your free time is for the most part respected (emergencies non-withstanding) and in my experience no one feels judged for using their PTO or VTO. - Many companies talk the talk in terms of diversity, but Salesforce walks the walk. They famously fought discriminatory laws in Indianapolis and unilaterally gave raises to ensure female employees were paid at the same rate as their male counterparts (without forcing pay cuts on anyone). They also strive to have a diverse board of directors, though I think this still needs work. - All full-time employees receive 7 paid days off (in addition to normal PTO) to pursue volunteer opportunities - and, again, this is actively encouraged. - Most managers do not have a ton of direct reports, meaning you can build a good relationship with your manager. - Career changes are not only permitted but encouraged. Some areas of the company have annual job fairs for lateral moves if you are not happy. In my case, my manager started to talk with me about where I want my career to go before I had even started to consider it. - Right now, great job security as the company is growing like crazy - which is great if you're used to consulting work.","- Most of the Pros are company-wide things, but your experience may vary depending on where you work. It is a large company and different areas do things differently. - A ton of middle management and time spent in meetings. - While it is great to be a part of a global company, there are challenges involved in working at a remote location (i.e. not in San Francisco).

90,"Really good C-Level management, some teams have a nasty culture, trust can be hard;","Jun 11, 2019 - Member Of Technical Staff in Boulder, CO",3.0,"- C-Level Management cares for employees. - Employee success is really good. - There are some genuinely talented people who can help you learn. - If you get on a good team (which is a stroke of luck), you might have some good projects to work on. - Good brand name & external perception. - Depending on team and your abilities to talk in badly run meetings, you may end up experiencing a huge growth.","- A very unsafe culture. Predatory behavior in meetings. Only a white can do such a thing and not face any consequences because trust is a right for the whites and for colored it is a loosely hanging privilege which might be lost anytime and needs to constantly work on earning the privilege. I saw people even at Sr.Director level (who was colored) just leaving the meeting not knowing what to say or do. Eventually that Sr.Director (who was top notch) left the team in the name of personal reasons. Believe it or not, those whites even got promotions and MVP awards. - Nepotism is prevalent. I was fully surprised by the way an engineering lead was lifted up to a top level leadership level so quickly (< 3 months since joining) without producing any good results. He was referred by another well positioned person in the team. The guy lacked humanity and was untrustworthy. He was aggressive, inconsistent, unresponsive, over-confident and was stepping on others toes a lot. Even providing feedback in the feedback app with facts to stop doing such things didn't help. - Absolutely no transparency in promotions. People who did great things didn't get promoted and they left. I was a founding engineer who worked for closely 2 years. Many of the peer reviews were extremely positive. I was involved in some of the top level architecture meetings, was openly stated in those meetings that this is a really critical piece so i was needed to do it and ultimately got the job done from me, only to let a white take over the project once it was done and I saw others getting promoted who built on top of the work I had done. My manager didn't say any bad things in our 1:1s, he promoted others, resigned and just before leaving he talked to me for a minute over a phone call and we never met. I was the biggest fool to trust these people. - I was low balled on the pay and the recruiter lied to me that salesforce doesn't do any sign on bonus and negotiations. - Extremely operations heavy culture. Once a product is built and released to the customers, the pace at which things move is unbelievably slow. Leadership kills innovations, condescends on engineers who innovated and worked hard to build the product and makes everything operations centric.",10 people found this review helpful

Territories are not intentionally unbalanced, but it does happen. A lot of the success you may or may not experience will be a result of a great or poor territory. Some managers understand this and work with you to maximize your results until the next year when things can be re-balanced, others are quick to terminate.

100,Designers can do more meaningful work elsewhere,"Jan 25, 2018 - Product Designer in San Francisco, CA",2.0,"Core benefits are good. Healthcare options seem competitive and are always looking to make better. The people you meet won’t all be so difficult. You’ll get the opportunity to volunteer and do some real good for someone else. I noticed if you have a family or are looking to start one, that the work life balance is probably your best benefit. However, such a good balance can often times appear to make individuals seem lazy and have little to no motivation to work quickly. That in turn has a trickle down effect to the rest of the teams who want to work quickly and build product.","I joined a smaller company Salesforce owned that was eventually swallowed whole by the larger Salesforce company, and we were fully integrated into one of the major clouds. Things were very pleasant and work was interesting before the roll over into Salesforce. However, once my team joined the larger company, is when things took a turn unfortunately. I believe things took a turn because Salesforce is built on top down management. The bigger the title the bigger the voice you’ll have. People use their title as weight when making decisions. The overall design culture is perceived as a second thought to a lot of teams. Due in part that your engineers can and will make decisions for you based on seniority. Not all, but most teams have a hard time getting their engineers to innovate and work with them. This behavior also comes from the previously mentioned work life balance. Anything that looks like it may take an extra hour, will fall off your design quickly. Be carful of Kool-aid drinking. They use the term “Ohana”, family in Hawaiian culture (which is also cultural appropriation) to describe their own internal company culture. The management team uses this type of thinking to determine if your a team player or not. The type of “family” culture they perpetuate creates a lot of passive aggressive behavior. Add the behavioral issues onto the top down management, and you have a recipe for ladder climbing, favoritism, yes men, and brown nosing. The executive running the design on my cloud showed incredible bias and fueled this behavior. As well as some very questionable hiring and promotional practices. I felt their behavior was highly unethical, and they felt no remorse for their actions. The product you build at Salesforce will only ship 3 times a year. That’s if it ships at all. The pace is incredibly slow moving. I can not stress that enough. Changing an icon can literally take 9 months. This can make it hard to retain the talent that comes from a start up environment. Which Salesforce is in desperate need of. The salary is adequate at best for most designers. I found out later that I actually made much more coming from a different company and rolling into Salesforce. RSU’s are some of the lowest you’ll be awarded in the tech industry for a company this size. Most director level people get any meaningful stock refresher. Like I mentioned, top down management. I negotiated cash over RSU’s (which made my offer compelling). While a lot of what I wrote can seems very negative, not everyone I had the chance to work with made me feel this way. I did have the opportunity to meet “some” talented designers and engineers. I had the opportunity to volunteer and help others. The work I was doing at the time had impact up to certain point and I did learn a thing or two while at Salesforce. TL;DR: Top down management creates passive aggressive behavior. Slow moving development time, Salesforce only ships 3 times a year. Design is a second thought for most teams (but not all). Base salary is average, not competitive. RSU’s for a company this size are some of the worst in the industry.",15 people found this review helpful

Great career growth opportunities. Planning of work is better than most other companies that I have come across.,"Hybrid Engineering has pros and cons. However, in Indy, the strategy for hybrid transition is causing a significant loss in engineering productivity. First, Pros: 1.) Hybrid engineering has brought more focus on using contemporary tools for automated testing. 2.) This helps in improving system reliability and make developers better at their jobs since testing is not considered an afterthought anymore. 3.) Huge investment in automated testing upfront is a good overall strategy that will help in system scalability and reduce buggy software releases. Cons: 1.) The idea for depending more on automated testing than on manual testing has translated into demanding all manual / semi manual qa testers to learn how to code. 2.) This is the strategy that has not panned out at all. While, the self help tools like online courses, mentoring resources and in-team guidance have been a proactive ongoing effort, this approach is taking massive hits on productivity for developers as well as for testers all around. 3.) You can find developers on any given day spending quite a bit of time (hours at times) going over basic step by step process (over and over again) with the testers to resolve minority non-mission critical bugs. 4.) Testers, especially who are not from a programming background / havent coded in a while, are overwhelmed and stressed out about the tickets they have to complete each sprint. 5.) For a company that champions engineering productivity and no interruption time for developers, developers are spending less time on quality features/innovative/disruptive work and more time getting bogged down by the process+manual testing+ incremental work . Dont get me wrong, the notion of ohana is embedded deep in the organization and engineers are glad to help their peers anytime.

Therefore, they don't care about anything except their AEs closing deals (I don't blame them!), they are annoyed when BDR management comes complaining that their AEs aren't working with their BDR... This is just not a conducive business model and doesn't help growth initiatives. Not everyone is measured the same. You could be aligned 2-4 AEs or 10-15 AEs as a BDR. Either way, these people are expected to generate the same amount of ""stage 2"" opportunity. If you have 2 AEs that are busy, don't work in your office or don't have the ""need"" for a BDR to generate pipeline - then you have NO chance of hitting your quota. SDRs, BDRs and AE's are all expected to generate their own pipeline - which makes sense but it is causing people to compete with each other which takes away from making the customer #1 priority. This is especially bad since the Mulesoft migration... (from BDR POV) Although Salesforce always talks about endless internal growth opportunities, this is def not something that I have seen to be encouraged. You are pretty much forced to take the typical promotion track. BDR Management is way too pushy with BDRs setting new meetings and business, while this should be a significant responsibility, lots of customers get mislead, forgotten, or treated with poor customer service which eventually will backfire (I have already seen it backfire a few times!) As a BDR you could generate $5mil in the pipeline one month, but only have 2 stage two opptys on the board (you need around 6-8)...which means you will miss your quota. Others could have 6-8 opptys on the board which only adds up to $300k in pipe for the month, but they will hit quota.. Doesn't make sense.",14 people found this review helpful

I’ve seen lots of highly successful AEs come to Salesforce and leave after less then a year after being dealt TERRIBLE territories mostly due to lots of upset oversold customers with lots of shelfware. Also, lots of poor implementations due to prior AEs not insisting on customers bringing in business partners when they should have because they just wanted to close deals....Many customers who look good on paper aren’t buying anything for these reasons....in many cases hard work has nothing to do with hitting your number - if you don’t have good/satisfied install accounts in your territory (total toss up btw) there is no path to success whatsoever as decent net new logo deals are few and far between (in Mid Market) - the expectation at Salesforce is that you won’t hit your number - you’ve been warned... Culture is another toss up depending on the RVP - they preach “Ohana” but in lots of cases it should be “nohana” - be VERY careful if you are looking at a job in one of the the coprime aka overlay AE divisions as it can be very toxic if your product set isn’t service cloud....be sure to really feel out your managers leadership style before you take one of these roles because there really are some brutally awful RVPs.

This is typical for large companies with internal software teams, but frankly I expected more from a company like Salesforce. User stores and bugs are tied back to epics that are ""committed"" to specific releases. They require stories that tie back outlining the project from start to finish, and individual stories are broken down further into ""tasks"" that really just lead to a tedious ""check the box"" workflow for most projects. If for some reason the project doesn't make it in the committed epic, prepare to be asked by multiple layers of management as to why it was dropped/delayed. If you're a developer looking for a 9-5 gig with the best benefits in town and an easy-going atmosphere, this might be for you. If you're a developer that wants to work with newer technologies and create truly innovative solutions to existing problems, look elsewhere. This job will not help you develop a better skillset, it will not help you work with newer tech, and it certainly won't allow you to come anywhere close to creating innovative solutions.",21 people found this review helpful

211,DO NOT JOIN THIS COMPANY.,"Nov 21, 2017 - CSM in San Francisco, CA",1.0,The top leaders truly have a vision and a plan. These are the angels that are on the pin head. Financial remuneration is as good or better than any other company if you attain your quotas. Most coworkers are helpful and cheerful. It is a joy to work from any from any of the beautiful offices. Internal tools such as Concierge and Trailheads are great. Growth is encouraged. Most new employees are given 60 days or so to ramp up.,"First, It is very much the same old type of network. Don't be taken in by the facade of empowering women. It is just one step off Weinstein-like mentality (there is no harassment of that type but the mentality is ""women, know your place"".) What I specifically mean is this: men have a way of doing the Sales, R&D, IT, and programs like Ignite. Women have to scurry along and just make nice. You dare not speak up. Some small amount of benign questioning will be ""allowed"". If you really challenge the unproductive practices, a swarm of managers and their managers and their managers will put you on ""employee success"" plan. This goes on your HR records. Once it does, you cannot transfer, get promoted, get a letter to attend Business School or get a good reference to go to another company. A multitude of other good things you might have done and your hard work will go down the drain. It makes people suicidal. This culture does not understand that this job is food on our table. Second, many former Google, Facebook, Nvidia, Microsoft and 5 Agency employees are welcome if they just about have a pulse. Hence, high ranking executives will come one or two days to work; will not have full comprehension of client's current/future stages; treat all engineers as inferior; and publicly chide team members. Third, Veterans are hired in droves. Hiring is all they do. That is all. Then a handful of hyper-gamified, substance-less Trails are thrown at them along with a ""mentor"" program. Most new hires, especially veterans, struggle between not knowing how to navigate the million tools and the embarrassment of asking colleagues on how to do things. Fourth, Salesforce attracts prospective employees in with a seemingly high pay. But, a large part of that is commission or bonus. IT IS IMPOSSIBLE to attain quota or utilization. This is another way for managers to crack the .",43 people found this review helpful

225,Want PTSD - Work for Salesforce,"Sep 9, 2019 - Senior Technical Program Manager",1.0,Plush office space Snacks Nice view from the upper floors,"Salesforce is the most toxic organization I have ever worked for, and I've worked for a lot of organizations as both an FTE, contractor, and consultant over the past two decades. Trying to pare down what I want to warn others of is difficult. I'll just bullet it out and you can decide what would wear you down, disrupt your sleep, and leave you paranoid, the most. - 1:1s with senior management where the most hateful things are said about your character, etc., and then afterward, the manager acts as though it never happened. -Pressure to give Salesforce a glowing Glassdoor rating after less than 30 days at the company when you do not know enough to provide an accurate review. - No written reviews, something called a 9 box where management provides their opinion of you and tells you it exists but then says you are never allowed to see it, per H/R. - If you want to apply for an internal position, you must have your manager's permission first. If you tell your manager you want to apply for the role and he/she does not want to lose you, he/she just says, no, you do not have my permission. Game over, you are going no where. - If you are allowed a desk (many have to submit to hoteling and never knowing where they will sit day to day), no personal plants, photos, or non SF toys allowed. They want a uniform look to the desks. -Forced volunteerism, if you do not log your 50 hour minimum of volunteer hours per year, you will be shamed at team meetings. Doesn't matter if you have kids, sick parents, 60 hour work week, whatever, you are expected to make the minimum. -No criticism of Benioff permitted. And don't ever say out loud that you found it disturbing to see a laying on of hands and someone praying over him as though he were a prophet at an internal company meeting. Management will quickly remind you that he is leading the 4th industrial revolution and he is the leading mind of our time. -If you are managing young hourly employees, be prepared to be instructed that you are to tell them they MUST go to team dinners, volunteer events, and SF ""fun"" activities but this is not work, so they don't get paid. If you push back, you will be reprimanded for ""not being Ohana."" - Teams are run by popularity. Backstabbing, shaming, and shunning are used to get the teams to stay quiet about how bad things are. People who speak out about behaviors, lack of professionalism, etc. are labeled, ""unOhana"" and told that they are not acting like family. - When you interview and you take a position, there is ZERO guarantee that the role you interviewed for and were hired for is the role you will be doing. The management opinion is to hire highly qualified people, they will be so grateful to be permitted to work at Salesforce, they will do whatever job we give them. I kid you not, you may have more than a decade of experience, be highly technical, have managed teams, and be hired for a technical role, then be told you are going to do data entry level work and you will be glad you are permitted to be at this company doing that. -If you are uncomfortable participating in some public events, e.g. parades, events, etc., and SF is participating in one, there is incredible pressure to spend your weekend in the parade or event. The expectation is that Salesforce and its needs come first. I cannot stress this enough, you are told that Salesforce is YOUR family and your family comes first. A lack of loyalty to the company will get penalized far more significantly and quicker than complete incompetence, maliciousness, or even harassment. Salesforce demands absolute devotion.",54 people found this review helpful

It's very open in many ways, such as - It's easy to get a hold of other teams and communicate. - Your teammates will be open to your crazy ideas. - Freedom to work on your own projects and switch teams","Getting started is still rough. Weeks of training, setting up your computer, waiting for other people to give you access to resources you need, and finding out information about anything is tough. We use chatter and google docs to keep track of random information like where to get a company phone or what API to use for integration with such and such. But both resources are a conglomeration of obsolete and inapplicable information. While we do pride ourselves on having an open culture, it isn't necessarily a very exciting, friendly or personal culture. You're generally free to do what you like, but many (maybe most) teams don't go to lunch together and aren't friends with each other. They just have small talk and do what it takes to get the job done well. Since your team is who you're with all day and who you talk to most of the time, it's kind of important. I wish it was the other way around, where my team was wanted to talk too much and spend more time hanging out than I did. The employees are kind of old here, so it's just not what I'm used to I suppose. Also, spoiled as I already am here, I will always be jealous of companies that have free cafeterias because I can't cook.",5 people found this review helpful

Sales Engineer staff is generally solid,"Mid Market AE’s get 8 total install accounts, only 2-3 of which will actually buy anything, particularly on the west coast (very small amount of accounts compared to Mid Market territories at other companies). I’ve seen lots of highly successful AEs come to Salesforce and leave after less then a year after being dealt TERRIBLE territories mostly due to lots of upset oversold customers with lots of shelfware. Also, lots of poor implementations due to prior AEs not insisting on customers bringing in business partners when they should have because they just wanted to close deals....Many customers who look good on paper aren’t buying anything for these reasons....in many cases hard work has nothing to do with hitting your number - if you don’t have good/satisfied install accounts in your territory (total toss up btw) there is no path to success whatsoever as decent net new logo deals are few and far between (in Mid Market) - the expectation at Salesforce is that you won’t hit your number - you’ve been warned... Culture is another toss up depending on the RVP - they preach “Ohana” but in lots of cases it should be “nohana” - be VERY careful if you are looking at a job in one of the the coprime aka overlay AE divisions as it can be very toxic if your product set isn’t service cloud....be sure to really feel out your managers leadership style before you take one of these roles because there really are some brutally awful RVPs.

240,Good with some bad,"Dec 18, 2018 - Success Agent Tier II in Indianapolis, IN",4.0,"Salesforce is the best place to work in Indy if you're in tech. The company offers quite a few perks, from free barista-served coffee to lavish holiday parties at which you might see flame throwers or magicians (depending on theme). PTO is good, not great, for newer employees (3 weeks), though another week and a half or so is given for volunteer work (VTO). The pay is good, with a 10% annual bonus (assuming your performance reviews are perfect). I always felt free to be myself and never felt that I had to change my behavior to fit in. Casual day is every day. There is no outdated mentality at Salesforce wherein employees can only be considered respectable if they are wearing a suit.","Marketing Cloud, at least, is still going through transition pains years after acquisition. Many processes have not worked out kinks yet, and it felt like San Francisco dictated to our office without taking into consideration our unique needs. During my time in Marketing Cloud Support, we were extremely under-staffed, with a discouragement of using overtime and yet we had to call every customer, every day, and provide them with a two-hour window during which we could call. I have been told that since I left rules have become even stricter. With tight SLAs, little overtime available, and a severe lack of staff, employees were extremely stressed and turnover became a real problem. We did not feel that the company cared whether the requirements of the job were impossible to perform in an 8-hour day. The team that existed when I left earlier this year looks nothing like the current team because of people feeling they had to leave to get out of the situation. Team leads and managers in Indianapolis were as supportive as they could be given the situation and pressure on them as well.

Visionary CEO Marc Benioff, created an idealistic culture where employees are paid to volunteer 50 hours a year, and the company matches their charitable donations up to $10K a year. At the company's San Francisco headquarters, employees have daily access to the best view on the West Coast, the 61st floor of Salesforce Tower. The workforce is generally smart, professional, and ethical. There are plenty of resources. Managers are on the whole receptive to new projects.","Because Salesforce is growing so fast – doubling its workforce and revenue over two years – many things get lost in the shuffle. Some teams have crushing workloads, while others are virtually forgotten. The prevailing infrastructure of the company is a parochial network of vice presidents operating independently. This leads to disconnection, and occasionally chaos. Teams duplicate work, work in contradictory directions, and compete pointlessly. Territoriality for budget and resources is rampant. There are no centralized checks and balances. If you have a bad or unethical warlord, you may be asked to do things that are counterproductive or even hurtful. The patchwork of fiefdoms across the company is so disconnected that many teams are unaware of similar teams within the company. Efforts to organize or connect strategies are met with resistance and sometimes hostility. A chief strategy officer with a team of connected project managers could address this, but many VPs don't want accountability. The result is work that doesn't rise above mediocrity. Salesforce is a great company comprised of dozens of mediocre companies. Those mediocre companies don't want to connect and be great because their leaders don't want to lose status. Once you see that you can't unsee it. Many workers grow cynical as a result.

255,Account Executive,,4.0,"- Sales education and training is best I've ever had - A repeatable process and unlimited tools to help you grow - Promotion path is clear and defined - Great people! We hire great people and it does build a family feel in the office - Work life balance. Salesforce is great at understanding the importance of balance and encourages you to not work long hours and to take your vacation. - Great benefits - robust benefits plan, wellness, education grant and more.",- Managers micromanage. This is a very metrics driven org where KPIs are assessed every week. - Territories are getting smaller and smaller - OTE is achievable but it's hard to hit your monthly quota month over month.,5 people found this review helpful

269,Great Place to Work,"Sep 26, 2017 - Anonymous Employee",5.0,"I've been pleasantly surprised at how great working at Salesforce is. Work/life balance is encouraged and modeled. My team is highly distributed and works well together. For the most part, the company is highly transparent and encourages questions - even if they're painful.",Recently there have been what appear to be missteps on the transparency front. There is a distributed/remote policy that management's not able to clearly articulate and communication has been very spotty to the people affected. I have faith that the company will properly communicate the final decision but months of waiting without any substantial progress doesn't seem very Salesforce-like.,1 person found this review helpful
