14,"Diverse work style support: An environment where remote work is possible is in place, and basically it is almost telecommuting. You can work anywhere as long as you have a computer, mobile phone, and internet environment that you can borrow. I don't necessarily have to go to the office during the corona crisis, and I find it attractive to be able to freely choose how to work. Basically, I make a schedule based on a calendar, so there are fluctuations in how busy I am at work, but I think it is very easy to maintain a work-life balance, such as being able to spend my free time on my hobbies and lessons. I don't think so."
60,"Diversity: We have people from various industries in our inside sales and SME departments. On the other hand, the age of the enterprise department is relatively high, and the early 40s are the volume zone, and I have the impression that there are many people from foreign IT companies. It feels like IBM, Oracle, HP, etc. are almost occupied."
150,"Office environment: There is a feeling that there are not enough seats because space is becoming scarce. You can work on any floor with a shared desk, but it seems that most of them are in teams."
182,Growth/career development: [Skills to acquire such as PC and language] Skills that are lacking are required to be acquired by yourself.

Running/walk at embarcadero bay is really joyful, you can enjoy ferry building, AT&T park, even Pier 39/Fisherman's Wharf at any free time. Cannot find a better place for running.
