0,4.7,"Working Hours/Holidays/Holidays: It's up to you to find a work-life balance. The basic working hours are from 9:00 to 18:00, but it is a super flextime with no core time. Therefore, you have to control it yourself. However, there are many things that must be done, such as self-study, document preparation, and customer surveys, so it is necessary to secure study time outside of work hours. It would be nice if I could make time to study during working hours, but most of the time I spend outside working hours due to customer support, research to advance business negotiations, internal meetings, etc. If you decide what to do and what not to do, you can maintain a good work-life balance, but if you try to do everything, even if you work until late at night every day, you will not be able to finish it, and you will be busy with work on holidays, and you will lose your balance. People who are not mentally bold tend to be hard to break down, push themselves into overwork, and tend to get sick. up to your control. Diverse work style support: Remote work depends on the department. Some departments are fully remote, while others come to work once or twice a week. However, family circumstances are taken into consideration, so they are not forced to come to work. Because of super flextime, it is possible to adjust the schedule, such as delaying the start of the morning to go to work after sending the child to nursery school for family reasons, or leaving early to pick up the child."
1,5.0,"Salary system: 80% of the estimated annual income presented is fixed salary and the remaining 20% ​​is incentives Incentives are paid quarterly. The calculation of incentives is more influenced by the figures of Japan as a whole than the figures of individuals, so for better or worse, you can get almost the same or more income than the initially presented assumed annual income. It is rare that you will receive an amount that is significantly different from the initial estimate, but it will not be less than the initial estimate. Evaluation system: Opportunity for promotion twice a year. As a premise, achieving individual goals is an important criterion for judgment, and if they do not achieve them, they will not be candidates for promotion in the first place. Among those who have achieved the goal, those who make a high degree of contribution in consideration of other activities and those who make high-quality proposals are promoted. There is also a pay raise apart from promotion, and there is a chance for a pay raise once a year. Salary increases are something that can be done if you are working normally, and your salary will increase by about 3 to 5% a year. The salary of the company is relatively high to begin with, so if your salary is 10 million yen in the previous year, your annual income will increase by 500,000 yen the following year, even if you are not promoted."
2,5.0,"Welfare: There is a good cafeteria in the office. The espresso machine is automatic, but the beans are specially roasted and replenished with good freshness, so I don't think you can taste the taste of this quality even at a full-fledged store. At first, most of the food was sweets, but in response to the voices of employees, healthy items such as dried fruits, fruits, nuts, and yogurt were offered, and I was worried about how much it would cost. Sometimes. ESPP and RSU, which are common in foreign companies, are helping to build assets other than salary at this time when stock prices are rising. Office Environment: Free desks are common due to lack of space for the increasing number of employees. There are quite a few meeting rooms, but they are not enough. The office furniture is well-invested, and the Aeron chair and stand-up desk are a big plus for someone who works long hours."
3,2.8,"Working Hours/Holiday Leave: Work-life balance is non-existent as long as you're an account executive. If you want to achieve this, you are told to work every day after 23:00 or until midnight, work on Saturdays and Sundays, and make five appointments all day from 9:00 to 19:00. If you don't have many appointments, your calendar screenshots will be made public and exposed to the company. Of course, the documentation will be done after that. In addition to that, commercial sales are made to build the customer's system. Diverse work style support: remote possible However, commercials have recently become obligatory to come to work, so it is possible to go home early.It means that you can work from home. Side jobs are OK."
4,4.7,"Working Hours/Holidays/Holidays: It's up to you to find a work-life balance. The basic working hours are 9:00-18:00, but it is a super flextime with no core time. Therefore, you have to control it yourself. However, there are many things to remember, so it is necessary to secure study time outside of working hours. It would be nice if I could make time to study during working hours, but most of the time I have to spend time outside of working hours due to in-house meetings, etc. for customer service and business negotiations. If you decide what to do and what not to do, you can maintain a good work-life balance. People who are not mentally bold tend to be hard to break down, push themselves into overwork, and tend to get sick. up to your control."
5,5.0,"Salary system: Base + Incentive is the basic base for sales is low, but incentives fluctuate greatly depending on the results of individual goals, so successful sales can get high salaries regardless of age and get promoted. Other than sales, basically, incentives fluctuate according to the achievement of team goals, so there is no big fluctuation in salary. Funds for back-office systems are determined by company-wide performance, and bonuses are determined by process evaluations by managers. Evaluation system: Basically, I think that meritocracy is thoroughly enforced. The number of people has increased considerably in the last few years, but the salary is high, but the ability. . . At least I don't see people around me."
6,4.9,"Welfare: There is no housing subsidy as it is a foreign company, but there are some distinctive welfare programs such as a subsidy for infertility treatment and a health investment subsidy of 10,000 yen per month. Office environment: Around March-April 2020, when the policy based on telework was decided, subsidies to prepare the home environment were provided (and basic facilities such as headsets and mobile routers were given separately). I thought it was generous. At present, it is easy to work in the home environment with that assistance, but the fulfillment of the office is also one of the great attractions. You can concentrate on your work while changing your mood at the light meal space and desks with various layouts."
7,3.8,"Welfare program: Welfare program is very fulfilling. I feel that it is not an operation that is easy for people to handle. The office environment is highly convincing when you consider the generous welfare package to endure the operation: There is a stylish cafeteria and free sweets, etc., and I feel that I am working in a very good environment. The environment inside the company is probably unimaginable in a Japanese company. as if. It feels like a company doing BtoC business."
8,4.3,"Welfare: I think that I am very blessed, such as subsidizing the cost of equipment for remote work. When I was working in the office, there were various drinks and food in the cafe space, and it was so fulfilling that I could live there. Office environment: It's currently fully remote, but when I went to work, it was very accessible because it was directly connected to Tokyo Station at JP Tower and I could walk from Otemachi. The new office building was built on the Otemachi side, so the only drawback is that people who used to commute from Tokyo Station will have to walk a little longer."
9,5.0,"Salary system: If you give a square number to a rabbit, it will bounce back to your salary. Moreover, basically it will be reflected in the next month's salary, so motivation will increase. In addition, it often happens that the incentive is doubled or tripled only for special products called Spiff, so even if the annual achievement rate is 60%, it often exceeds the theoretical annual income. It's a great company with an amazing system. Evaluation system: Only numbers are reflected in the evaluation, so it is extremely easy to understand, and there is no need for extra thinking or rulers."
10,4.3,"Salary system: I think that it is good because the salary is secured to some extent for the Mgr position. If the number of outside sales increases, the annual income will be considerable, but if it does not increase, there is a risk that it will be considerably low. It seems that there is a dream because an annual income of 100 million is not a dream just by signing a big one shot. Evaluation system: Basically, we decide whether or not you can be promoted by interviewing people other than your own department. However, I think that the number of people who talk about positions has increased considerably as the company has grown."
11,4.5,"Salary level: Sales positions have a base: incentive ratio of 6:4, making it an unsuitable environment for those who want to earn a stable income on a base basis. This is a standard level for a foreign company, but depending on the department and position, the base may be extremely low, so it may be difficult for married people and householders who need a stable life. It seems that there is room for negotiation with HR before joining the company, but there is a possibility that you will fall into an unexpected pitfall if you judge only by the high theoretical annual salary. The difference in treatment between people who are headhunted and those who apply is tremendous, and depending on the person, there are cases where the theoretical annual salary is double even for the same position or position. Some sales representatives actually joined the company with a theoretical annual salary similar to that of an executive."
12,5.0,"Salary system: As much as you raise sales, it bounces back to your salary. The commission is basically reflected in the salary in the next month, so that is also a motivation. In addition, it is also wonderful that the campaign is managed so that the motivation is not interrupted because the campaign of double or triple the commission is run depending on the situation. However, I think there is a lot of variation in the numbers depending on the area you are in charge of. Evaluation system: There is no doubt that it is meritocracy. Those who achieve results are evaluated. That said, if it is clear from the outside that even those who haven't raised it are making an effort, it is considered to be an object of evaluation."
13,4.9,"Welfare: There is no housing subsidy, but I feel that the salary is reasonably high. Many employees use the system of purchasing company stock as an investment tool. Regarding welfare, there is a system that subsidizes the expenses used for maintaining health by a certain amount every month, and everyone uses it habitually. Office environment: very clean. You are free to use any seat that is vacant. There is a mindfulness room where you can meditate and take a rest if you are tired."
14,4.8,"Salary system: Since the percentage of incentives is large, there is a big difference between new graduates and mid-career employees, and whether they are in sales or not. Since the budget is abundant, there are many allowances such as well-being allowance and home assistance. Evaluation system: There is no trend of seniority system like Japanese companies. Since the evaluation is clear and made by a large number of people involved in various fields, basically we do not receive evaluations that cause dissatisfaction."
15,3.8,"Welfare: The company also pays half of the corporate-type defined contribution pension. You can buy your shares on pretty good terms. Unlike Japanese companies, there are no housing subsidies or book purchase costs, but business school and outside courses can be covered up to about 600,000 yen a year. Also, I have the impression that there is quite a bit of care when something happens, such as illness, including family members. Office environment: Unknown at this time as we are moving to a new office"
16,4.0,"Office environment: Conference rooms are glass-enclosed for transparency. You can also get sweets and drinks for free at the cafe. Until before Corona, light meals were also provided. The office is directly connected to Tokyo Station, so you can commute without getting wet in the rain. From February this year, it will be directly connected to Otemachi Station, so you can come to work without getting wet in the rain. However, due to full remote work, there are few opportunities to go to the office. Even if there is, it is necessary to pre-register with the company's service before coming to work."
17,4.8,"Welfare: There are no housing subsidies, dormitories, property accumulation savings, etc. You can buy employee discount stocks. PC peripherals can be purchased at the company's vending machines. You can eat furugura, yogurt, sweets, ice cream, etc. for free. There are plenty of drinks, sometimes red bull. Office Environment: There are many meeting rooms and refreshment spaces. Some rooms seem to be empty."
18,4.3,"Business strengths: Product groups such as CRM and EC seem to continue to be in demand due to the COVID-19 crisis. Weaknesses in the business: I feel that they are looking for customers who fit hypothetical issues because they are more focused on selling their own products rather than making proposals that match the customer's issues. Since there is a custom of praising and imitating successful cases, it is often the case that similar developments are made by twisting the materials, but I think that this will not work in the future."
19,4.3,"Gap between expectations when joining the company and after joining: Although I negotiated with customers as an enterprise salesperson, I could not get out of selling licenses, and I felt that most of the proposals for the last mile depended on partner vendors. Even if it was sold directly as it is, I didn't feel like I could finally see how the customer implemented it and improved their business. Even if it was just partial optimization, there were many responses that forced us into the department."
20,4.5,"Welfare: ・Shareholding system ・There is a subsidy for health activities (gym, massage, etc.) up to 10,000 yen per month, which leads to motivation to actively use it. Office environment: There was a situation where the office was unable to keep up with the increase in the number of people, but I think that COVID-19 has changed everything. We are planning to move to our own building next year, so I think it will improve."
21,4.1,"Benefits: Benefits other than commuting allowances and social insurance are listed on the menu. Office Environment: The office is located in a prime location near Tokyo Station. For employees who do not live in the city center, commuting time was often painful, but since the corona crisis, remote work has become the default, making it easier to work. The office requires a reservation to come to work, so there are cases where it is not possible to get a place."
22,5.0,"Welfare: I have the impression that the company has a well-developed welfare program that puts the ease of working for employees first. If it is an initiative that benefits the health of employees, it will be paid separately from the monthly salary of 10,000 yen. Widely used for massage, golf, gym, etc. There is support for staff with children, and it is an environment that is very easy to work for those with families. Although the only drawback is that there is no retirement allowance, the salary level is high, so if you can save money systematically, there is no problem."
23,3.8,"Corporate culture/corporate style: We have a system for volunteering, and many employees are highly conscious of contributing to society. Diversity/Diversity: It's a foreign company, but I think it's quite a Japanese company. There are some foreign employees, but my impression is that most of them can speak Japanese without difficulty. Personnel exchanges such as assignments to the head office are not very popular."
24,4.3,"Salary system: Annual salary system and commission (incentive) payment system. The ratio is 60% of annual salary and 40% of commission, which is determined in a personnel interview before joining the company. Partly because of the high awareness of the company's ES and the recent good performance, a certain percentage of the sales support for remote work due to Corona (subsidies for purchasing IT equipment at home) and sales that could not go out due to self-restraint restrictions A generous system such as commission compensation is in place."
25,4.7,"Salary system: base salary + incentives. Incentives fluctuate according to target achievement rate. There is no cap on the amount of incentives paid. The more you sell, the more you will be returned. Depending on the time and product, the incentive amount may increase by 1.5 to 3 times. There are no bonuses as there are plenty of incentives. If you sell, you can make money, but if you don't sell, you don't get incentives, so your salary fluctuates. Transportation expenses are calculated at actual cost."
26,5.0,"Working hours/holidays/leaves: Since you control what you need to do, you can plan your own days off. Some people almost use up the paid leave they were given. In addition to paid leave, there are sick leave that can be used when you catch a cold, and nursing care leave that you can use when your child catches a cold and misses school. I don't and I can't stop."
27,4.7,"Salary system: base salary + incentives. Incentives fluctuate according to target achievement rate. There is no cap on the amount of incentives paid. The more you sell, the more you will be returned. Depending on the season and product, the incentive amount may increase by 1.5 to 2 times. There are no bonuses as there are plenty of incentives. If you sell, you can make money, but if you don't sell, there is no incentive, so your salary fluctuates. Transportation expenses are calculated at actual cost."
28,3.9,"Salary system: The percentage of incentives is huge. I think the current situation is that ote is quite low compared to other foreign companies. However, since the incentive is not only the amount but also the number of years of contract, spiff, etc., you can earn money even if you do not achieve it, and if you achieve it, you will get an accelerator, so it is good. Evaluation system: Depends on the account. mostly quantitative"
29,4.5,"Business outlook: To be honest, it has spread considerably due to acquisitions, but I think it will slow down in the future. Large-scale introduction by major companies has progressed considerably in Japan as well, so I wonder if there will be any white space in the future. After that, even though the target sales per sales person is increasing, the number of people in charge is increasing and the number of accounts in charge is decreasing, so the impression that the incentive that is umami is getting less and less."
30,4.1,"Salary system: Divided into basic salary and performance-based salary, and for performance-based salary, each employee's goals can be flexibly defined in consultation with their superiors. Evaluation system: Job grades are clearly defined, and the criteria required for promotion are clear. Evaluation criteria other than work results, such as age and gender, are almost non-existent."
31,3.7,"Salary system: A little higher than other companies in the same industry. Granted stock options. Evaluation system: Since this is a new company, there is no seniority system. Most of them are mid-career hires. It's not a perfect meritocracy, but ability is required. English proficiency will be an advantage."
32,4.7,"Salary system: 10% of annual salary is bonus. Bonuses are not necessarily paid in full. Assuming full payment, 75 percent of the bonus will be paid in April and the remaining 25 percent in October. Evaluation system: There are clear criteria for promotion, which are open to all employees."
33,3.5,"Growth/career development: Career options seem to be wide, but I feel that they are narrow. In particular, when changing jobs from a different industry, the career begins with inside sales, but after that it is difficult to choose a career other than outside sales. There are many people who cannot choose a career because there are no slots, so they stay inside sales and start looking for a new job."
34,4.5,"Salary system: I think the salary level is generally high compared to the industry. There are an overwhelming number of mid-career employees, and I think that the range differs depending on the experience at the time of joining the company. Evaluation system: Numerical results are evaluated in an easy-to-understand manner, but on the other hand, if you can't leave numbers, it is difficult to lead to evaluation."
35,4.5,"Welfare program: There is a system that allows you to purchase the company's stock at a discount without housing subsidies. Office environment: There is an environment where you can work very cleanly and comfortably, such as office space. Snacks and drinks are available free of charge, so if you get hungry, you can continue your work while picking them up."
36,5.0,"Salary system: Although it depends on the type of job, sales are annual salary system + volume. So basically no overtime. However, due to the high standard, many employees are very satisfied with the evaluation system: promotion is basically once a year and the degree of difficulty is high. However, some people are promoted during the term. There are many young managers who are completely meritocracy."
37,3.7,"Benefits: Stock options are contracted. Office environment: Located in a prime location in the city center. I don't use an umbrella because the building is directly connected to Tokyo Station. There is a free vending machine in the company, and rice balls, sandwiches, ice cream, drinks, etc. are all free."
38,4.7,"Welfare: There is a system for purchasing company stock up to 15% of annual salary. There are 20 days of paid leave from the first year, 12 days of sick leave, and 5 days of nursing leave. Office Environment: We recently moved our head office to Otemachi. I've never been there, so I don't know the details."
39,5.0,"Benefits: Very cheap to buy company stock. Specifically, you can purchase at 15% off the price of the first and last half of the year, whichever is lower. Office environment: Work from home almost completely from March 2020 through July 2021."
40,3.7,"Salary system: There is quite a gap. Most of them are on an annual salary system. There are also bonuses at the end of the year. There are stock options, and you can sell the company stock. Evaluation system: Most of them are mid-career hires."
41,4.5,"Working hours/holidays/holidays: If you are assigned to a department that does not know the abilities and capacities of individual temporary staff, you will be given unreasonable requests such as ""please by tomorrow morning"" when there is clearly not enough time. may require long hours of overtime. Employees seem to assume that telework is possible, so they can take their computers home and work, but many people don't seem to understand that temporary employees can't do their work unless they're at the company. Also, even if a temporary employee consults that he or she is working overtime and cannot finish it within the deadline, the employee will be merciless and say, ""That's not my job,"" and leave without helping. I'm trying to shift."
42,4.5,"Working hours and holidays: Working hours are 8 hours with a 1 hour break from 9:00 to 18:00, which is very common. If the work is not busy, you can basically leave work on time. Also, you can go at any time during your lunch break, so if you want to avoid crowds, you can stagger your schedule to 11:30 or 13:00. The Marunouchi area, where our Japanese head office is located, is particularly crowded during lunchtime, so we are very grateful for that. Since our employees work flextime, it is possible for temporary employees to change their working hours if they have a reasonable reason and consult with us. In the past, when I said, ""I want to leave the office at 17:00 to go to the hospital, so I'd like to go to work one hour earlier, at 8:00,"" I got approval."
43,4.5,"Working hours/holidays: [Acquisition of paid leave] Paid leave is quite easy to obtain because it is a corporate culture that encourages taking it. It seems that employees can take leave separately in the morning and afternoon, and I often see people who take leave in the afternoon, go to the airport and travel, etc. Also, if it's just picking up your child or going to the hospital, you can adjust the time by flextime or remote work, so you don't have to bother to reduce your paid vacation. did. Even if temporary employees apply for paid leave for about a week in a row, they can definitely get it without being asked about the reason."
44,4.5,"Working hours/holidays: [Acquisition of long vacations] Employees are granted more days of paid vacation than the legal requirement, and it is very easy to take vacations, so we will encourage temporary employees to take vacations as well. I explained that I rarely take paid leave because I only have about 10 days, which is legally required, but people who push me a little to take a vacation, such as ""I should refresh myself!"" There is Even if you were able to take a week off like an employee, if you don't use your paid leave, your salary will be reduced by about 70,000 to 80,000 yen."
45,4.5,"Job description: [Individual discretion] If you are given a boss who does not have management skills, you will be instructed and work as if you are being monitored. Also, there are many employees who do not understand what it is like to work with temporary staff, and since they have not received any instructions for almost half a year after joining the company, there are many temporary staff who quit because they are too busy. On the other hand, some misguided employees treat temporary workers as if they were employees and expect them to gobble up the work themselves without giving them the basics and knowledge."
46,2.8,"Welfare: There is no housing subsidy, but there are monthly health subsidies, home allowances, and stock ownership associations. Office environment: We have moved to a new office building, but there are few opportunities to use it. It used to be nice to have a clean office, but I don't know if I'll ever have the opportunity to make use of it."
47,4.6,"Salary level: The salary is based on the previous job, but the base alone will not exceed the previous job. Since it is premised that basic incentives are provided, the salary will be more than the previous job, including that. There is no upper limit for incentives, so if you achieve them, you will receive a large amount of money. If it exceeds 120% etc., it will be accelerated and it will increase more. This is different between Enterprise and Small. If even young people can produce numbers, it will become a company where they can earn good salaries, which is also connected to their motivation."
48,5.0,"Company stability: Since it is a subscription-type business rather than a so-called SI or one-off package software business, contracts continue to accumulate and grow steadily as long as the license is not canceled. There is a mechanism for retention support and follow-up of existing customers (including user meetings, etc.) so that they do not cancel, so it feels good to be able to work from the perspective of ""customer success""."
49,5.0,"Working hours/holidays/holidays: Paid usage rate tends to be low in the sales department. However, not only results but also all processes are visualized in Salesforce, so people who ""do what they do properly"" rarely complain about taking a break. In addition, it is visualized that sales numbers will increase if we can thoroughly ""do what we do"", so each person has a sense of conviction."
50,3.9,"Welfare: Nothing special. I don't think there are many people who expect welfare benefits. Office environment: I no longer come to work, but the office is clean. And the relocation will be done, but the new office looks pretty amazing."
51,4.8,"Salary system: It is a general salary system for sales at foreign-affiliated companies. Basic salary plus incentives. If KPIs are significantly achieved, the incentives will increase as well. There are only a handful of people whose KPIs exceed 100% in inside sales. There are almost no allowances."
52,4.9,"Salary system: About 40% of sales incentives. If you achieve it, you will get big. Evaluation system: In sales, the order amount is greatly reflected in the salary. Multifaceted evaluation is done to raise the job grade."
53,5.0,"Working hours/holidays/holidays: 9:00-18:00. After that, it's up to the individual to work or not. Personally, I work overtime to get results, but I feel that the work style that allows me to take time to raise my children is very attractive because I work completely from home."
54,4.5,"Employment stability: [Compatibility between work and private life] As long as you can produce results, people won't say too much.  Basically, work is from 9:00 to 18:00, but overtime work is normal because there is no overtime pay. However, as long as the results are consistent, no one will complain even if they leave work at 18:00."
55,4.7,"Corporate Culture/Corporate Style: Good atmosphere. Diversity: No discrimination based on gender, race, nationality, religion, or disability. completely equal."
56,5.0,"Salary system: very good. No problem. A very good company and I would recommend it to anyone. Rating system: Very good. There is no particular problem, it is meritocracy."
57,4.5,Compensation: Base: Incentive was 6:4. Incentives are linked to individual new sales Rating system: vague
58,4.5,"Growth/career development: [Presence or absence of guidance from superiors and seniors] It is better to think that there is no guidance, especially for sales to super large companies.   There is a person called a tutor, but it is a disposition that people later say, ""Actually, I was a tutor.""   I can't use my boss' managing director at all."
59,4.9,"Ease of working for women: When I consulted with my boss about how to work after maternity and childcare leave, the rules were immediately reviewed."
60,4.9,"Salary system: Because of the incentive system, salaries are paid according to performance. Evaluation system: Merit-based and sales positions are easy to understand."
61,4.5,Salary system: All sales are composed of basic salary + incentives Evaluation system: Whether or not the target is achieved is the evaluation axis
62,4.5,"Working Hours/Holidays/Holidays: Overtime pay is substantial. There is a clear division between those who work overtime and those who do not, and there is an imbalance in the workload of each individual. If you work overtime after 10:00, you will receive a late-night allowance. If overtime hours exceed 60 hours per month (360 agreement), guidance is provided."
63,4.9,"Salary system: Sales are base salary + quarterly commission system. If the degree of achievement against the target is good, the commission will increase accordingly, but if the performance is not good, it will be the base salary + a small amount."
64,4.1,"Salary level: For the sales department, there is a base, but a complete performance-based incentive system has been introduced. The base incentive rate varies depending on the experience level in the middle. Salary is high compared to competitors."
65,4.1,"Working hours/holidays/holidays: Overtime (actual working hours) is generally long in order to achieve good results.・In general, it is difficult to get the expected evaluation without doing a lot of hard work soon after joining the company.・There is a discrepancy between the superficial system (creating an atmosphere within the company) and the reality of the workplace."
66,4.8,"Salary system: For sales-related occupations, it depends on the achievement of goals. Evaluation system: Sales positions are based on the target achievement rate."
67,4.5,"Motivation: [Tolerance for failure] It is difficult to express by being tolerant or strict. We don't have a culture of pushing responsibility or blaming one person, but people who repeatedly fail can't keep up with the speed of work and naturally quit."
68,4.3,Salary system: Enterprise sales account executive monthly salary + incentive system. The ratio of monthly salary to incentives was 6:4.
69,3.9,Easy to work for women: We have an environment that is easy for women to work in. Many people are actually returning from maternity leave.
70,4.5,"Welfare: [Ease of taking paid leave, how to apply] Apply online 2-3 days in advance.   The hurdles for consulting on applications are low, as communication is carried out using in-house communication tools."
71,4.5,Welfare: [Health-related initiatives and systems] We have begun to visualize overwork through the use of time cards for all employees. Specific measures after visualization and visualization accuracy are yet to come.
72,4.5,"Office environment: Only the message precedes, and in Japan, without trying to realize the essential meaning, the message that comes out of the headquarters is ostensibly used to force the employees to overdo it."
73,4.6,"Gap between expectations when joining the company and after joining: Too busy. Japanese Americans, not foreigners"
74,4.8,"Ease of working for women: There are many female employees. However, the percentage of women in sales positions is low."
75,4.6,Ease of working for women: It is easy to work. It's not like she's a woman.
76,4.5,"Corporate culture/corporate style/organizational system: [Is the environment comfortable to work in?] If I had to say it, the number of employees has increased too much and the company has become smaller. It is a problem because there is no budget to increase the number of offices."
77,4.5,"Working hours/holidays and holidays: Overtime hours are long, but overtime pay is paid except for outside sales. I don't care about working hours because I will return as much as I do outside sales."
78,3.8,Ease of working for women: There are many considerations that make it easier for women to work
79,4.5,"Salary level: 34 years old Annual income of 20 million incentives is a sky ceiling, but the base salary is reasonable, so life is stable. No better treatment."
80,4.5,"Motivation: [Relationships with other departments] Low. There are times when I check with the sales person in charge regarding customer contracts, but everything is completed on SNS."
81,4.5,Welfare: [Systems and efforts to reduce working hours] None in particular. It seems that there is not much of such an idea because of the annual salary system.
82,4.5,Growth/career development: [Presence or absence of guidance from superiors and seniors] No one will teach you passively. Volunteer to listen.
83,4.5,Employment stability: [Monthly overtime hours] About 30 hours a month. neither more nor less.
84,4.8,"Working hours/holidays/holidays: I think it varies depending on the type of job and department, but there were some full-time employees who got married and had children, so I think the company can adjust to some extent as long as they are doing their own work properly. felt. Diverse work style support: I heard that remote work is the main thing after corona. Some people went home early due to going to the hospital or having children. I think that it was possible to adjust the time to some extent by negotiating with temporary staff."
85,4.8,"Salary system: I was a temporary employee, so I don't know about the company's salary system. I think it's result-oriented. Evaluation system: I was a temporary employee, so I don't know about the evaluation system. I think it's a meritocracy."
86,4.5,"Salary level: As an hourly wage for dispatch, it can be described as ""normal"". I've never had a particularly good salary. Also, when I talked to an employee who works in the back office, he told me that it was surprisingly cheap, saying, ""Are you sure you can only get this amount?"" However, it seems that the more you sell, the more money you make."
87,4.8,"Ease of working for women: Even when I was enrolled, there were female employees who had children but were adjusted to work for pick-up and drop-off, so I think it is easy to work. I feel that it is a company that can rise to the top if it is evaluated regardless of gender."
88,4.5,"Easy to work for women: Temporary employees are not particularly recognized as members of the company, so they do not feel that they are particularly easy to work for. Rather, newly-married employees in their 20s say, ""I'm busy,"" and just throw away simple tasks and miscellaneous chores, and go home quickly with the excuse that they need to go to the hospital."
89,2.8,"Ease of working for women: Number of female managers. Not only in the in-house department, but also in the sales department. However, there are still more men. Working hours are up to you to discuss with your manager, so it may be easier to work than others."
90,2.8,"Evaluation system: The salary is too high for the content of the current job and working hours. The base salary is good, so I don't feel like I'm working hard to raise my salary."
91,4.5,Growth/career development: [Whether or not there is guidance from superiors and seniors] I think that many people are hired as ready-to-work rather than guidance. I think it's easy to get advice from seniors. I just think that if the person wants and acts on their own.
92,4.5,"Growth/career development: [Is the environment where responsibility and discretion are given early on?] In my case, it was. I'm still a contract employee, but I have a budget from the beginning, and I have a lot of responsible work and projects, such as setting numerical targets."
93,4.6,"Growth potential/future potential: Since it is a foreign company, if your boss is in the US, communication will be in English, so if you are not proficient in English, it will be difficult. Fluency in English is a must if you want to move up."
94,4.6,"Growth potential/future potential: We have solid welfare programs for our employees. Support for the use of sports clubs, subsidies for English schools, in-house refreshment services, etc."
95,4.5,"Corporate culture/corporate style/organizational system: [High employee motivation] None in particular. Basically, they are highly motivated and work hard. To put it bluntly, I don't really have a strong interest in other people. It depends on the person."
96,4.5,"Office environment: We don't have to do the cleaning ourselves, and if the contractor keeps it clean all the time, I feel that each person's manners tend to be loose and dependent. Small and medium-sized enterprises clean their surroundings by themselves."
97,4.9,"Office environment: JP Tower does not have enough seats for the ever-increasing number of people. There are not enough meeting rooms, and assistants and secretaries are struggling."
98,4.5,"Salary level: Temporary employees may suddenly have their contracts terminated due to organizational changes, etc., so if you don't work hard every day with a sense of urgency to improve your skills, you will be worried about the future."
99,4.8,Gap between expectations when joining the company and after joining: There is no particular gap because I was a non-regular employee
100,4.5,"Job Description: Temporary employees will also be given a certain degree of responsibility. However, the results are all taken by the employees saying, ""Thanks to my management."""
101,4.5,Corporate culture/corporate style/organizational system: [Points that employees should improve] It cannot be said that they are highly skilled in non-business work. Inexperienced people sometimes work inefficiently.
102,4.5,"Diverse Work Style Support: Dispatch is just dispatch. I get yelled at if I don't come on time, but I need to work overtime to finish the work that I've been forced to do."
103,4.5,"Education/Training: [Support from people around me] Basically, I was told to do my own research. I was surprised that some employees didn't even know they were in charge."
104,4.5,"Job satisfaction: [Severity of work] It becomes difficult to produce results. Since I am a sales person, I think I may fail, so it depends on the job."
105,4.7,"Working Hours/Holidays/Holidays: It's up to you to find a work-life balance. The basic working hours are from 9:00 to 18:00, but it is a super flextime with no core time. Therefore, you have to control it yourself. However, there are many things that must be done, such as self-study, document preparation, and customer surveys, so it is necessary to secure study time outside of work hours. It would be nice if I could make time to study during working hours, but most of the time I spend outside working hours due to customer support, research to advance business negotiations, internal meetings, etc. If you decide what to do and what not to do, you can maintain a good work-life balance, but if you try to do everything, even if you work until late at night every day, you will not be able to finish it, and you will be busy with work on holidays, and you will lose your balance. People who are not mentally bold tend to be hard to break down, push themselves into overwork, and tend to get sick. up to your control. Diverse work style support: Remote work depends on the department. Some departments are fully remote, while others come to work once or twice a week. However, family circumstances are taken into consideration, so they are not forced to come to work. Because of super flextime, it is possible to adjust the schedule, such as delaying the start of the morning to go to work after sending the child to nursery school for family reasons, or leaving early to pick up the child."
106,5.0,"Salary system: 80% of the estimated annual income presented is fixed salary and the remaining 20% ​​is incentives Incentives are paid quarterly. The calculation of incentives is more influenced by the figures of Japan as a whole than the figures of individuals, so for better or worse, you can get almost the same or more income than the initially presented assumed annual income. It is rare that you will receive an amount that is significantly different from the initial estimate, but it will not be less than the initial estimate. Evaluation system: Opportunity for promotion twice a year. As a premise, achieving individual goals is an important criterion for judgment, and if they do not achieve them, they will not be candidates for promotion in the first place. Among those who have achieved the goal, those who make a high degree of contribution in consideration of other activities and those who make high-quality proposals are promoted. There is also a pay raise apart from promotion, and there is a chance for a pay raise once a year. Salary increases are something that can be done if you are working normally, and your salary will increase by about 3 to 5% a year. The salary of the company is relatively high to begin with, so if your salary is 10 million yen in the previous year, your annual income will increase by 500,000 yen the following year, even if you are not promoted."
107,5.0,"Welfare: There is a good cafeteria in the office. The espresso machine is automatic, but the beans are specially roasted and replenished with good freshness, so I don't think you can taste the taste of this quality even at a full-fledged store. At first, most of the food was sweets, but in response to the voices of employees, healthy items such as dried fruits, fruits, nuts, and yogurt were offered, and I was worried about how much it would cost. Sometimes. ESPP and RSU, which are common in foreign companies, are helping to build assets other than salary at this time when stock prices are rising. Office Environment: Free desks are common due to lack of space for the increasing number of employees. There are quite a few meeting rooms, but they are not enough. The office furniture is well-invested, and the Aeron chair and stand-up desk are a big plus for someone who works long hours."
108,2.8,"Working Hours/Holiday Leave: Work-life balance is non-existent as long as you're an account executive. If you want to achieve this, you are told to work every day after 23:00 or until midnight, work on Saturdays and Sundays, and make five appointments all day from 9:00 to 19:00. If you don't have many appointments, your calendar screenshots will be made public and exposed to the company. Of course, the documentation will be done after that. In addition to that, commercial sales are made to build the customer's system. Diverse work style support: remote possible However, commercials have recently become obligatory to come to work, so it is possible to go home early.It means that you can work from home. Side jobs are OK."
109,4.7,"Working Hours/Holidays/Holidays: It's up to you to find a work-life balance. The basic working hours are 9:00-18:00, but it is a super flextime with no core time. Therefore, you have to control it yourself. However, there are many things to remember, so it is necessary to secure study time outside of working hours. It would be nice if I could make time to study during working hours, but most of the time I have to spend time outside of working hours due to in-house meetings, etc. for customer service and business negotiations. If you decide what to do and what not to do, you can maintain a good work-life balance. People who are not mentally bold tend to be hard to break down, push themselves into overwork, and tend to get sick. up to your control."
110,5.0,"Salary system: Base + Incentive is the basic base for sales is low, but incentives fluctuate greatly depending on the results of individual goals, so successful sales can get high salaries regardless of age and get promoted. Other than sales, basically, incentives fluctuate according to the achievement of team goals, so there is no big fluctuation in salary. Funds for back-office systems are determined by company-wide performance, and bonuses are determined by process evaluations by managers. Evaluation system: Basically, I think that meritocracy is thoroughly enforced. The number of people has increased considerably in the last few years, but the salary is high, but the ability. . . At least I don't see people around me."
111,4.9,"Welfare: There is no housing subsidy as it is a foreign company, but there are some distinctive welfare programs such as a subsidy for infertility treatment and a health investment subsidy of 10,000 yen per month. Office environment: Around March-April 2020, when the policy based on telework was decided, subsidies to prepare the home environment were provided (and basic facilities such as headsets and mobile routers were given separately). I thought it was generous. At present, it is easy to work in the home environment with that assistance, but the fulfillment of the office is also one of the great attractions. You can concentrate on your work while changing your mood at the light meal space and desks with various layouts."
112,3.8,"Welfare program: Welfare program is very fulfilling. I feel that it is not an operation that is easy for people to handle. The office environment is highly convincing when you consider the generous welfare package to endure the operation: There is a stylish cafeteria and free sweets, etc., and I feel that I am working in a very good environment. The environment inside the company is probably unimaginable in a Japanese company. as if. It feels like a company doing BtoC business."
113,4.3,"Welfare: I think that I am very blessed, such as subsidizing the cost of equipment for remote work. When I was working in the office, there were various drinks and food in the cafe space, and it was so fulfilling that I could live there. Office environment: It's currently fully remote, but when I went to work, it was very accessible because it was directly connected to Tokyo Station at JP Tower and I could walk from Otemachi. The new office building was built on the Otemachi side, so the only drawback is that people who used to commute from Tokyo Station will have to walk a little longer."
114,5.0,"Salary system: If you give a square number to a rabbit, it will bounce back to your salary. Moreover, basically it will be reflected in the next month's salary, so motivation will increase. In addition, it often happens that the incentive is doubled or tripled only for special products called Spiff, so even if the annual achievement rate is 60%, it often exceeds the theoretical annual income. It's a great company with an amazing system. Evaluation system: Only numbers are reflected in the evaluation, so it is extremely easy to understand, and there is no need for extra thinking or rulers."
115,4.3,"Salary system: I think that it is good because the salary is secured to some extent for the Mgr position. If the number of outside sales increases, the annual income will be considerable, but if it does not increase, there is a risk that it will be considerably low. It seems that there is a dream because an annual income of 100 million is not a dream just by signing a big one shot. Evaluation system: Basically, we decide whether or not you can be promoted by interviewing people other than your own department. However, I think that the number of people who talk about positions has increased considerably as the company has grown."
116,4.5,"Salary level: Sales positions have a base: incentive ratio of 6:4, making it an unsuitable environment for those who want to earn a stable income on a base basis. This is a standard level for a foreign company, but depending on the department and position, the base may be extremely low, so it may be difficult for married people and householders who need a stable life. It seems that there is room for negotiation with HR before joining the company, but there is a possibility that you will fall into an unexpected pitfall if you judge only by the high theoretical annual salary. The difference in treatment between people who are headhunted and those who apply is tremendous, and depending on the person, there are cases where the theoretical annual salary is double even for the same position or position. Some sales representatives actually joined the company with a theoretical annual salary similar to that of an executive."
117,5.0,"Salary system: As much as you raise sales, it bounces back to your salary. The commission is basically reflected in the salary in the next month, so that is also a motivation. In addition, it is also wonderful that the campaign is managed so that the motivation is not interrupted because the campaign of double or triple the commission is run depending on the situation. However, I think there is a lot of variation in the numbers depending on the area you are in charge of. Evaluation system: There is no doubt that it is meritocracy. Those who achieve results are evaluated. That said, if it is clear from the outside that even those who haven't raised it are making an effort, it is considered to be an object of evaluation."
118,4.9,"Welfare: There is no housing subsidy, but I feel that the salary is reasonably high. Many employees use the system of purchasing company stock as an investment tool. Regarding welfare, there is a system that subsidizes the expenses used for maintaining health by a certain amount every month, and everyone uses it habitually. Office environment: very clean. You are free to use any seat that is vacant. There is a mindfulness room where you can meditate and take a rest if you are tired."
119,4.8,"Salary system: Since the percentage of incentives is large, there is a big difference between new graduates and mid-career employees, and whether they are in sales or not. Since the budget is abundant, there are many allowances such as well-being allowance and home assistance. Evaluation system: There is no trend of seniority system like Japanese companies. Since the evaluation is clear and made by a large number of people involved in various fields, basically we do not receive evaluations that cause dissatisfaction."
120,3.8,"Welfare: The company also pays half of the corporate-type defined contribution pension. You can buy your shares on pretty good terms. Unlike Japanese companies, there are no housing subsidies or book purchase costs, but business school and outside courses can be covered up to about 600,000 yen a year. Also, I have the impression that there is quite a bit of care when something happens, such as illness, including family members. Office environment: Unknown at this time as we are moving to a new office"
121,4.0,"Office environment: Conference rooms are glass-enclosed for transparency. You can also get sweets and drinks for free at the cafe. Until before Corona, light meals were also provided. The office is directly connected to Tokyo Station, so you can commute without getting wet in the rain. From February this year, it will be directly connected to Otemachi Station, so you can come to work without getting wet in the rain. However, due to full remote work, there are few opportunities to go to the office. Even if there is, it is necessary to pre-register with the company's service before coming to work."
122,4.8,"Welfare: There are no housing subsidies, dormitories, property accumulation savings, etc. You can buy employee discount stocks. PC peripherals can be purchased at the company's vending machines. You can eat furugura, yogurt, sweets, ice cream, etc. for free. There are plenty of drinks, sometimes red bull. Office Environment: There are many meeting rooms and refreshment spaces. Some rooms seem to be empty."
123,4.3,"Business strengths: Product groups such as CRM and EC seem to continue to be in demand due to the COVID-19 crisis. Weaknesses in the business: I feel that they are looking for customers who fit hypothetical issues because they are more focused on selling their own products rather than making proposals that match the customer's issues. Since there is a custom of praising and imitating successful cases, it is often the case that similar developments are made by twisting the materials, but I think that this will not work in the future."
124,4.3,"Gap between expectations when joining the company and after joining: Although I negotiated with customers as an enterprise salesperson, I could not get out of selling licenses, and I felt that most of the proposals for the last mile depended on partner vendors. Even if it was sold directly as it is, I didn't feel like I could finally see how the customer implemented it and improved their business. Even if it was just partial optimization, there were many responses that forced us into the department."
125,4.5,"Welfare: ・Shareholding system ・There is a subsidy for health activities (gym, massage, etc.) up to 10,000 yen per month, which leads to motivation to actively use it. Office environment: There was a situation where the office was unable to keep up with the increase in the number of people, but I think that COVID-19 has changed everything. We are planning to move to our own building next year, so I think it will improve."
126,4.1,"Benefits: Benefits other than commuting allowances and social insurance are listed on the menu. Office Environment: The office is located in a prime location near Tokyo Station. For employees who do not live in the city center, commuting time was often painful, but since the corona crisis, remote work has become the default, making it easier to work. The office requires a reservation to come to work, so there are cases where it is not possible to get a place."
127,5.0,"Welfare: I have the impression that the company has a well-developed welfare program that puts the ease of working for employees first. If it is an initiative that benefits the health of employees, it will be paid separately from the monthly salary of 10,000 yen. Widely used for massage, golf, gym, etc. There is support for staff with children, and it is an environment that is very easy to work for those with families. Although the only drawback is that there is no retirement allowance, the salary level is high, so if you can save money systematically, there is no problem."
128,3.8,"Corporate culture/corporate style: We have a system for volunteering, and many employees are highly conscious of contributing to society. Diversity/Diversity: It's a foreign company, but I think it's quite a Japanese company. There are some foreign employees, but my impression is that most of them can speak Japanese without difficulty. Personnel exchanges such as assignments to the head office are not very popular."
129,4.3,"Salary system: Annual salary system and commission (incentive) payment system. The ratio is 60% of annual salary and 40% of commission, which is determined in a personnel interview before joining the company. Partly because of the high awareness of the company's ES and the recent good performance, a certain percentage of the sales support for remote work due to Corona (subsidies for purchasing IT equipment at home) and sales that could not go out due to self-restraint restrictions A generous system such as commission compensation is in place."
130,4.7,"Salary system: base salary + incentives. Incentives fluctuate according to target achievement rate. There is no cap on the amount of incentives paid. The more you sell, the more you will be returned. Depending on the time and product, the incentive amount may increase by 1.5 to 3 times. There are no bonuses as there are plenty of incentives. If you sell, you can make money, but if you don't sell, you don't get incentives, so your salary fluctuates. Transportation expenses are calculated at actual cost."
131,5.0,"Working hours/holidays/leaves: Since you control what you need to do, you can plan your own days off. Some people almost use up the paid leave they were given. In addition to paid leave, there are sick leave that can be used when you catch a cold, and nursing care leave that you can use when your child catches a cold and misses school. I don't and I can't stop."
132,4.7,"Salary system: base salary + incentives. Incentives fluctuate according to target achievement rate. There is no cap on the amount of incentives paid. The more you sell, the more you will be returned. Depending on the season and product, the incentive amount may increase by 1.5 to 2 times. There are no bonuses as there are plenty of incentives. If you sell, you can make money, but if you don't sell, there is no incentive, so your salary fluctuates. Transportation expenses are calculated at actual cost."
133,3.9,"Salary system: The percentage of incentives is huge. I think the current situation is that ote is quite low compared to other foreign companies. However, since the incentive is not only the amount but also the number of years of contract, spiff, etc., you can earn money even if you do not achieve it, and if you achieve it, you will get an accelerator, so it is good. Evaluation system: Depends on the account. mostly quantitative"
134,4.5,"Business outlook: To be honest, it has spread considerably due to acquisitions, but I think it will slow down in the future. Large-scale introduction by major companies has progressed considerably in Japan as well, so I wonder if there will be any white space in the future. After that, even though the target sales per sales person is increasing, the number of people in charge is increasing and the number of accounts in charge is decreasing, so the impression that the incentive that is umami is getting less and less."
135,4.1,"Salary system: Divided into basic salary and performance-based salary, and for performance-based salary, each employee's goals can be flexibly defined in consultation with their superiors. Evaluation system: Job grades are clearly defined, and the criteria required for promotion are clear. Evaluation criteria other than work results, such as age and gender, are almost non-existent."
136,3.7,"Salary system: A little higher than other companies in the same industry. Granted stock options. Evaluation system: Since this is a new company, there is no seniority system. Most of them are mid-career hires. It's not a perfect meritocracy, but ability is required. English proficiency will be an advantage."
137,4.7,"Salary system: 10% of annual salary is bonus. Bonuses are not necessarily paid in full. Assuming full payment, 75 percent of the bonus will be paid in April and the remaining 25 percent in October. Evaluation system: There are clear criteria for promotion, which are open to all employees."
138,3.5,"Growth/career development: Career options seem to be wide, but I feel that they are narrow. In particular, when changing jobs from a different industry, the career begins with inside sales, but after that it is difficult to choose a career other than outside sales. There are many people who cannot choose a career because there are no slots, so they stay inside sales and start looking for a new job."
139,4.5,"Salary system: I think the salary level is generally high compared to the industry. There are an overwhelming number of mid-career employees, and I think that the range differs depending on the experience at the time of joining the company. Evaluation system: Numerical results are evaluated in an easy-to-understand manner, but on the other hand, if you can't leave numbers, it is difficult to lead to evaluation."
140,4.5,"Welfare program: There is a system that allows you to purchase the company's stock at a discount without housing subsidies. Office environment: There is an environment where you can work very cleanly and comfortably, such as office space. Snacks and drinks are available free of charge, so if you get hungry, you can continue your work while picking them up."
141,5.0,"Salary system: Although it depends on the type of job, sales are annual salary system + volume. So basically no overtime. However, due to the high standard, many employees are very satisfied with the evaluation system: promotion is basically once a year and the degree of difficulty is high. However, some people are promoted during the term. There are many young managers who are completely meritocracy."
142,3.7,"Benefits: Stock options are contracted. Office environment: Located in a prime location in the city center. I don't use an umbrella because the building is directly connected to Tokyo Station. There is a free vending machine in the company, and rice balls, sandwiches, ice cream, drinks, etc. are all free."
143,4.7,"Welfare: There is a system for purchasing company stock up to 15% of annual salary. There are 20 days of paid leave from the first year, 12 days of sick leave, and 5 days of nursing leave. Office Environment: We recently moved our head office to Otemachi. I've never been there, so I don't know the details."
144,5.0,"Benefits: Very cheap to buy company stock. Specifically, you can purchase at 15% off the price of the first and last half of the year, whichever is lower. Office environment: Work from home almost completely from March 2020 through July 2021."
145,3.7,"Salary system: There is quite a gap. Most of them are on an annual salary system. There are also bonuses at the end of the year. There are stock options, and you can sell the company stock. Evaluation system: Most of them are mid-career hires."
146,4.5,"Working hours/holidays/holidays: If you are assigned to a department that does not know the abilities and capacities of individual temporary staff, you will be given unreasonable requests such as ""please by tomorrow morning"" when there is clearly not enough time. may require long hours of overtime. Employees seem to assume that telework is possible, so they can take their computers home and work, but many people don't seem to understand that temporary employees can't do their work unless they're at the company. Also, even if a temporary employee consults that he or she is working overtime and cannot finish it within the deadline, the employee will be merciless and say, ""That's not my job,"" and leave without helping. I'm trying to shift."
147,4.5,"Working hours and holidays: Working hours are 8 hours with a 1 hour break from 9:00 to 18:00, which is very common. If the work is not busy, you can basically leave work on time. Also, you can go at any time during your lunch break, so if you want to avoid crowds, you can stagger your schedule to 11:30 or 13:00. The Marunouchi area, where our Japanese head office is located, is particularly crowded during lunchtime, so we are very grateful for that. Since our employees work flextime, it is possible for temporary employees to change their working hours if they have a reasonable reason and consult with us. In the past, when I said, ""I want to leave the office at 17:00 to go to the hospital, so I'd like to go to work one hour earlier, at 8:00,"" I got approval."
148,4.5,"Working hours/holidays: [Acquisition of paid leave] Paid leave is quite easy to obtain because it is a corporate culture that encourages taking it. It seems that employees can take leave separately in the morning and afternoon, and I often see people who take leave in the afternoon, go to the airport and travel, etc. Also, if it's just picking up your child or going to the hospital, you can adjust the time by flextime or remote work, so you don't have to bother to reduce your paid vacation. did. Even if temporary employees apply for paid leave for about a week in a row, they can definitely get it without being asked about the reason."
149,4.5,"Working hours/holidays: [Acquisition of long vacations] Employees are granted more days of paid vacation than the legal requirement, and it is very easy to take vacations, so we will encourage temporary employees to take vacations as well. I explained that I rarely take paid leave because I only have about 10 days, which is legally required, but people who push me a little to take a vacation, such as ""I should refresh myself!"" There is Even if you were able to take a week off like an employee, if you don't use your paid leave, your salary will be reduced by about 70,000 to 80,000 yen."
150,4.5,"Job description: [Individual discretion] If you are given a boss who does not have management skills, you will be instructed and work as if you are being monitored. Also, there are many employees who do not understand what it is like to work with temporary staff, and since they have not received any instructions for almost half a year after joining the company, there are many temporary staff who quit because they are too busy. On the other hand, some misguided employees treat temporary workers as if they were employees and expect them to gobble up the work themselves without giving them the basics and knowledge."
151,2.8,"Welfare: There is no housing subsidy, but there are monthly health subsidies, home allowances, and stock ownership associations. Office environment: We have moved to a new office building, but there are few opportunities to use it. It used to be nice to have a clean office, but I don't know if I'll ever have the opportunity to make use of it."
152,4.6,"Salary level: The salary is based on the previous job, but the base alone will not exceed the previous job. Since it is premised that basic incentives are provided, the salary will be more than the previous job, including that. There is no upper limit for incentives, so if you achieve them, you will receive a large amount of money. If it exceeds 120% etc., it will be accelerated and it will increase more. This is different between Enterprise and Small. If even young people can produce numbers, it will become a company where they can earn good salaries, which is also connected to their motivation."
153,5.0,"Company stability: Since it is a subscription-type business rather than a so-called SI or one-off package software business, contracts continue to accumulate and grow steadily as long as the license is not canceled. There is a mechanism for retention support and follow-up of existing customers (including user meetings, etc.) so that they do not cancel, so it feels good to be able to work from the perspective of ""customer success""."
154,5.0,"Working hours/holidays/holidays: Paid usage rate tends to be low in the sales department. However, not only results but also all processes are visualized in Salesforce, so people who ""do what they do properly"" rarely complain about taking a break. In addition, it is visualized that sales numbers will increase if we can thoroughly ""do what we do"", so each person has a sense of conviction."
155,3.9,"Welfare: Nothing special. I don't think there are many people who expect welfare benefits. Office environment: I no longer come to work, but the office is clean. And the relocation will be done, but the new office looks pretty amazing."
156,4.8,"Salary system: It is a general salary system for sales at foreign-affiliated companies. Basic salary plus incentives. If KPIs are significantly achieved, the incentives will increase as well. There are only a handful of people whose KPIs exceed 100% in inside sales. There are almost no allowances."
157,4.9,"Salary system: About 40% of sales incentives. If you achieve it, you will get big. Evaluation system: In sales, the order amount is greatly reflected in the salary. Multifaceted evaluation is done to raise the job grade."
158,5.0,"Working hours/holidays/holidays: 9:00-18:00. After that, it's up to the individual to work or not. Personally, I work overtime to get results, but I feel that the work style that allows me to take time to raise my children is very attractive because I work completely from home."
159,4.5,"Employment stability: [Compatibility between work and private life] As long as you can produce results, people won't say too much.  Basically, work is from 9:00 to 18:00, but overtime work is normal because there is no overtime pay. However, as long as the results are consistent, no one will complain even if they leave work at 18:00."
160,4.7,"Corporate Culture/Corporate Style: Good atmosphere. Diversity: No discrimination based on gender, race, nationality, religion, or disability. completely equal."
161,5.0,"Salary system: very good. No problem. A very good company and I would recommend it to anyone. Rating system: Very good. There is no particular problem, it is meritocracy."
162,4.5,Compensation: Base: Incentive was 6:4. Incentives are linked to individual new sales Rating system: vague
163,4.5,"Growth/career development: [Presence or absence of guidance from superiors and seniors] It is better to think that there is no guidance, especially for sales to super large companies.   There is a person called a tutor, but it is a disposition that people later say, ""Actually, I was a tutor.""   I can't use my boss' managing director at all."
164,4.9,"Ease of working for women: When I consulted with my boss about how to work after maternity and childcare leave, the rules were immediately reviewed."
165,4.9,"Salary system: Because of the incentive system, salaries are paid according to performance. Evaluation system: Merit-based and sales positions are easy to understand."
166,4.5,Salary system: All sales are composed of basic salary + incentives Evaluation system: Whether or not the target is achieved is the evaluation axis
167,4.5,"Working Hours/Holidays/Holidays: Overtime pay is substantial. There is a clear division between those who work overtime and those who do not, and there is an imbalance in the workload of each individual. If you work overtime after 10:00, you will receive a late-night allowance. If overtime hours exceed 60 hours per month (360 agreement), guidance is provided."
168,4.9,"Salary system: Sales are base salary + quarterly commission system. If the degree of achievement against the target is good, the commission will increase accordingly, but if the performance is not good, it will be the base salary + a small amount."
169,4.1,"Salary level: For the sales department, there is a base, but a complete performance-based incentive system has been introduced. The base incentive rate varies depending on the experience level in the middle. Salary is high compared to competitors."
170,4.1,"Working hours/holidays/holidays: Overtime (actual working hours) is generally long in order to achieve good results.・In general, it is difficult to get the expected evaluation without doing a lot of hard work soon after joining the company.・There is a discrepancy between the superficial system (creating an atmosphere within the company) and the reality of the workplace."
171,4.8,"Salary system: For sales-related occupations, it depends on the achievement of goals. Evaluation system: Sales positions are based on the target achievement rate."
172,4.5,"Motivation: [Tolerance for failure] It is difficult to express by being tolerant or strict. We don't have a culture of pushing responsibility or blaming one person, but people who repeatedly fail can't keep up with the speed of work and naturally quit."
173,4.3,Salary system: Enterprise sales account executive monthly salary + incentive system. The ratio of monthly salary to incentives was 6:4.
174,3.9,Easy to work for women: We have an environment that is easy for women to work in. Many people are actually returning from maternity leave.
175,4.5,"Welfare: [Ease of taking paid leave, how to apply] Apply online 2-3 days in advance.   The hurdles for consulting on applications are low, as communication is carried out using in-house communication tools."
176,4.5,Welfare: [Health-related initiatives and systems] We have begun to visualize overwork through the use of time cards for all employees. Specific measures after visualization and visualization accuracy are yet to come.
177,4.5,"Office environment: Only the message precedes, and in Japan, without trying to realize the essential meaning, the message that comes out of the headquarters is ostensibly used to force the employees to overdo it."
178,4.6,"Gap between expectations when joining the company and after joining: Too busy. Japanese Americans, not foreigners"
179,4.8,"Ease of working for women: There are many female employees. However, the percentage of women in sales positions is low."
180,4.6,Ease of working for women: It is easy to work. It's not like she's a woman.
181,4.5,"Corporate culture/corporate style/organizational system: [Is the environment comfortable to work in?] If I had to say it, the number of employees has increased too much and the company has become smaller. It is a problem because there is no budget to increase the number of offices."
182,4.5,"Working hours/holidays and holidays: Overtime hours are long, but overtime pay is paid except for outside sales. I don't care about working hours because I will return as much as I do outside sales."
183,3.8,Ease of working for women: There are many considerations that make it easier for women to work
184,4.5,"Salary level: 34 years old Annual income of 20 million incentives is a sky ceiling, but the base salary is reasonable, so life is stable. No better treatment."
185,4.5,"Motivation: [Relationships with other departments] Low. There are times when I check with the sales person in charge regarding customer contracts, but everything is completed on SNS."
186,4.5,Welfare: [Systems and efforts to reduce working hours] None in particular. It seems that there is not much of such an idea because of the annual salary system.
187,4.5,Growth/career development: [Presence or absence of guidance from superiors and seniors] No one will teach you passively. Volunteer to listen.
188,4.5,Employment stability: [Monthly overtime hours] About 30 hours a month. neither more nor less.
189,4.8,"Working hours/holidays/holidays: I think it varies depending on the type of job and department, but there were some full-time employees who got married and had children, so I think the company can adjust to some extent as long as they are doing their own work properly. felt. Diverse work style support: I heard that remote work is the main thing after corona. Some people went home early due to going to the hospital or having children. I think that it was possible to adjust the time to some extent by negotiating with temporary staff."
190,4.8,"Salary system: I was a temporary employee, so I don't know about the company's salary system. I think it's result-oriented. Evaluation system: I was a temporary employee, so I don't know about the evaluation system. I think it's a meritocracy."
191,4.5,"Salary level: As an hourly wage for dispatch, it can be described as ""normal"". I've never had a particularly good salary. Also, when I talked to an employee who works in the back office, he told me that it was surprisingly cheap, saying, ""Are you sure you can only get this amount?"" However, it seems that the more you sell, the more money you make."
192,4.8,"Ease of working for women: Even when I was enrolled, there were female employees who had children but were adjusted to work for pick-up and drop-off, so I think it is easy to work. I feel that it is a company that can rise to the top if it is evaluated regardless of gender."
193,4.5,"Easy to work for women: Temporary employees are not particularly recognized as members of the company, so they do not feel that they are particularly easy to work for. Rather, newly-married employees in their 20s say, ""I'm busy,"" and just throw away simple tasks and miscellaneous chores, and go home quickly with the excuse that they need to go to the hospital."
194,2.8,"Ease of working for women: Number of female managers. Not only in the in-house department, but also in the sales department. However, there are still more men. Working hours are up to you to discuss with your manager, so it may be easier to work than others."
195,2.8,"Evaluation system: The salary is too high for the content of the current job and working hours. The base salary is good, so I don't feel like I'm working hard to raise my salary."
196,4.5,Growth/career development: [Whether or not there is guidance from superiors and seniors] I think that many people are hired as ready-to-work rather than guidance. I think it's easy to get advice from seniors. I just think that if the person wants and acts on their own.
197,4.5,"Growth/career development: [Is the environment where responsibility and discretion are given early on?] In my case, it was. I'm still a contract employee, but I have a budget from the beginning, and I have a lot of responsible work and projects, such as setting numerical targets."
198,4.6,"Growth potential/future potential: Since it is a foreign company, if your boss is in the US, communication will be in English, so if you are not proficient in English, it will be difficult. Fluency in English is a must if you want to move up."
199,4.6,"Growth potential/future potential: We have solid welfare programs for our employees. Support for the use of sports clubs, subsidies for English schools, in-house refreshment services, etc."
200,4.5,"Corporate culture/corporate style/organizational system: [High employee motivation] None in particular. Basically, they are highly motivated and work hard. To put it bluntly, I don't really have a strong interest in other people. It depends on the person."
201,4.5,"Office environment: We don't have to do the cleaning ourselves, and if the contractor keeps it clean all the time, I feel that each person's manners tend to be loose and dependent. Small and medium-sized enterprises clean their surroundings by themselves."

210,5.0,As the company grows we are creating silos.
211,5.0,"Staying organized is a bit of a challenge but that is on me to figure out. With so much work and so many people to interact with, it is very tough to keep everything organized and straight. The tools are there, I just need to master them."
212,4.0,The boundaries are a bit difficult given work is extending longer periods of time -- but that could be the case anywhere.
213,5.0,Management is a little bit messy... not sure whether this is something all big companies have
214,5.0,The standard is that you will still be available to work during PTO so it's tough to feel like you can actually unplug during that time.
215,4.0,Lack of mentorship on my specific teams. Lack of clear onboarding for junior devs that left me floundering a bit.

238,3.0,Lacks the diversity they tend to portray online.
239,3.0,long hours standing on feet
240,2.0,"This is a severely toxic organization - reorgs and a lot of political fighting, posturing and sabotage between the VPs as they try really hard to get noticed by the EVPs. What's worse is that it appears that the HR folks are either powerless and so they go along or they are in on it. Several coworkers described experiences of being horribly berated by hatchet folks in HR based on ""complaints"" that HR would not clarify or explain. They described being pulled onto phone calls and told they have to ""apologize for what you did"", and when asked what they were talking about, would be told ""it's impossible that you don't know what we're talking about and if you don't then it's even worse than we thought."" Some have hypothesized this is how Salesforce rattles employees they, for whatever reason, decide they want to leave ( inside scoop indicates this is another maneuver by some VPs to create ""opportunities"" to shape an org the way they want when they get key folks to self-select out) but have no reason to push them out or worse yet, the employees were actually considered high performing by prior managers. I highly recommend anyone considering Salesforce to stay away unless it is the best you can get because its a huge company, if you get on the wrong side of just about anyone it could get really bad for you and there is nothing you can do."
241,5.0,can't think of any cons
242,5.0,"Can feel hard to take time off on your schedule - life revolves around month end, quarter end, etc."
243,5.0,"Pressure to perform, high expectations"
244,4.0,"With exceeding priorities, there is little work life balance in ES. The burn-out is real."
245,4.0,"- The senior leadership and some of the middle leaders in this department clearly does not align with Salesforce as a company. We sit in employee town halls discussing flex time and working from home, but the leadership in this department wants to micro manage their teams and press their thumbs down on everyone. This department has been watered down so much in the last several years and we constantly hear about how we need to ""lower the cost to serve"" while also trying to shove case closures down everyone's throats."
246,5.0,Culture is taking some getting use to
247,5.0,A lot of work and stress. Limited resources.
248,4.0,Tech & codebase is old and difficult to change

256,5.0,the larger it gets - hard to keep that entrepreneurial culture going
257,5.0,"- Onboarding during COVID-19 has been weird and difficult, but they are doing their best given the limitations - There are many meetings. My advice is to always take control of your calendar - RSU refresh is rare from what I hear - Internal move can be difficult, but not impossible with some strategic networking - The senior management still lacks diversity but the company is working on it"
258,5.0,There are no downsides... No cons!
259,5.0,"Getting large, which is both positive and creates some challenges"
260,5.0,At the time there was a lot of travel and offsite meetings. As the company gets larger more red tape.

270,2.0,"Toxic, back biting, gossip, no one can say the emperor has no clothes, completely subjective"

282,4.0,Career paths through the company are really hard to navigate. With the large-scale M&A the company has tons of nooks and crannies.
283,5.0,"Terrible HR/ES team. They refuse to be transparent with your employee grade level and don't give real raises for internal promotions, especially if you're in sales."

287,4.0,"Slow development cycle, no room for promotion"
288,4.0,"1. Month-end results internal culture in an externally quarterly results driven business. Resulting in: - Disingenuous messaging - Constant emphasis on short vs. long term - Burn out 2.

313,4.0,can be a very stressful environment
314,5.0,SO MANY RESOURCES AND NOT SURE HOW THEY ALL PLAY INTO THE JOB
315,2.0,"The culture is extremely fake. A lot of politicking and constantly being told to ""stay in your lane"". I'm not sure why this company is always in the top list on glassdoor when it's clear they don't truly care about their employees.

332,4.0,Upward mobility was difficult to chart a path
333,2.0,"Poor mentoring program, all the product sales specialists have been eliminated so the onus is now on the Core salespeople to run all product sales cycles, definitely a backstabbing environment where instead of working through issues directly with individuals the norm is to go straight to their boss first and create a contentious relationship, the sales goals are not attainable (especially in light of COVID-19), and there is a complete misunderstanding of how enterprise accounts buy versus commercial accounts."

390,4.0,Health insurance need improve better health
391,4.0,"- Can be bureaucratic at times being such a highly-matrixed organization - Although innovation is a core value, company size can interfere with ability to be super nimble and agile for certain departments at times (but this not unique to Salesforce, most large companies struggle with this) - Hard work is rewarded, but you also have to be diligent about establishing your brand and getting visibility with those who have power to help advance your career. So if you are not comfortable advocating for yourself and sometimes shouting your wins from the rooftop you may not want to work here. This is very true in Marketing, perhaps not all other BUs. - While diversity is a core a value, Salesforce like most tech companies are not as diverse as they think, so something to keep in mind if you're a minority. They are, however, making HUGE priorities around DEI initiatives particularly with recruiting efforts."

411,4.0,"Although the company says they value work/life balance, it can be an issue, depending on individual team culture"
412,3.0,"Can feel ""cultish"" at times. SE pay varies based on Geography which can mean a paycut/non-competitive pay depending on where you live and where you were working before. SE's are not paid commission for the quarter if they leave during the quarter. No pro-rated pay. Nothing. You just lose it. Only place I've worked where you give two weeks notice, they agree you can leave after a week because there is not reason to keep you aboard for the full two weeks, and they don't pay you the full two weeks. While employed, the culture felt caring and inclusive, and not like a big company . When you're ready to leave, you get treated like it's a big company where you are just a number."

442,2.0,~80 hour work weeks are the norm. Constant shifting of priorities creates mountains of technical debt that is never paid down. Teams are not adequately staffed to handle extra load from other members going off on parental leave for months at a time. There is empire building happening at the senior management level that often results in career casualties for the people doing actual work.
443,5.0,No complaints here. None none
444,5.0,It builds a lot of tools internally so employees can sometimes not get exposed to the newest technologies outside the company.
445,5.0,"- It's a luxury to have so many resources/products to sell and I'm thankful, but it often leads to tons of internal meetings, information overload, busy work, and in turn, have less time to focus on selling - Territories are getting smaller and smaller so the ceiling gets lower for earning potential, but we also have acquired so many great products it kinda off sets this, but if you get a rough patch in terms of territory/timing, it will be hard to crush it"

449,4.0,"The location is awful, it is depressing to work not in the city center - yes they’re moving to the docks but it’s still pretty far from downtown and won’t happen before 2021 No food - just some snacks, and pretty bad/unhealthy ones. These 2 points might seem trivial, but you will spend quite a lot of money on Luas and food, trust me, not to mention the time lost when commuting Career progression is there BUT it is extremely slow, which means it also takes a lot of years to move out of Dublin if you want to stay with the same company (4/5 years) It takes a lot of networking to move between functions (BDR to SE or CS) Harsh split of fixed and variable salary in AE roles (50-50) Level of stress always depends on the manager you get There’s not much of a fun element at work, besides the people, who are for the most part lovely and motivated. But no fun company kick off abroad, no cool off sites abroad, no happy hours, no end of quarter drinks... just compare it to other big tech company like Linkedin and Google - it’s much more boring The WFH policy for sales dev is non existent (1 day/month). Pretty ridiculous when this is an EMEA HQ and people are coming from all over. Allow people to go home and work from there to see their families, without having to take PTO all the time. Politics - it is a corporation, so it is political. It’s very clear that sometimes people get a role over others just because they are better liked, not because of their skills.

472,3.0,"Although the work culture is great, but there are few areas that require transparency."
473,3.0,"- Taking into account the cost of living in Dublin the salary is not enough to get by - if you want to be able to live comfortably you should go elsewhere, but if you just want the experience it is worth it - Senior management does not bother communicating well at all with normal staff, it does not make you feel valued at all - Cramped offices, poor selection of snacks"
474,4.0,"There is a real lack of cohesion to the sales organization. When you first join you are pretty left to fend for yourself and see to your own integration. The sales targets are completely ridiculous and the compensation plan has been making it more difficult to make money every year. This year I am going to make approximately €25-40k (depending how my year finishes) less than the average of my last two years. The overall attainment figures for sales people are in the toilet. This will not be made clear during your interview and will not be openly discussed with management as to what a realistic quota should be. This ultimately has created a toxic environment where people feel undervalued due to their inability to hit an unrealistic target. In theory, everyone can make good money. In reality 90% of people will miss their target and the majority of commissions will be left in the hands of the few. The increasing product offering of Salesforce brings problems in terms of collaboration. It is not always easy to find the right person for the right meeting in good time. This can make it difficult for customers to do business with us, as the sales process can become protracted. While career options are varied, the criteria for promotion isn't ever clear. It is often a case of 10 people interviewing not knowing how many roles will be filled, not knowing when they will find out and unclear feedback as to why they did/didn't get the role. Naturally this has caused people to question the process."

491,5.0,as per my experience best place to work
492,4.0,None Can’t think of any
493,4.0,"The base salary is relatively poor although the ability to make commission can be massive. With that said, it comes down to the companies you're working with and there are plenty of very talented people at Salesforce doing poorly for this reason. The inverse applies as well - although the overall people standard is high there are some with mediocre talent and effort who stumble blindly into huge paydays. Also, when you're in you're in – you tend to only view the world through the lens of Salesforce."
494,3.0,Very sales focused and growth targets are very aggressive. Career opportunities are surprisingly limited and very talented people can get stuck in roles for years as the structure is so flat in marketing and the team is so lean that there’s often nowhere to go. Management is also very hit and miss. Some are great and others are incompetent. This inconsistency means that those under good managers do well and those under bad managers get stuck. The company needs to invest more in training people to be leaders and coaches rather than just putting them in charge due to tenure. Workload can be extremely high and overwhelming so it takes a while to work out how to get by without burning out. Also tend to employ highly experienced people to do a lot of execution as headcount is so limited they need to hire people who can create a strategy and execute it. This leads to frustration among people who could be doing so much more but get stuck in the detail of delivery.
495,5.0,Huge amount of work and poor balance between pro and private life (please notice that this is my personal experience.) Paris’s office is too small and crowded for all the employees.

500,5.0,I can feel like you are behind the pace of the organisation and the hugely talented people within . You need to take time to get up to speed and you are given the time and encouragement.
501,5.0,"no cons, only good things"
502,1.0,"I was with Salesforce for a year. When I started I was made a lot of promises regarding the territories being fair within the team. However, once I got my territory and saw how it was compared to other territories across the team, I realized that 80% of the territories in any given team are bad. Only 20% of the accounts/territories are good and in which the sales people make money. And Management knows this. So if you are an Account Executive aligned well with Management, you are set. However, if you are like the 80% of the account executives, your fate is NOT in your hands as you will get bad accounts. They know this. The management's objective at least in the Toronto office is to only have 20% of the people make their #. They dont want anyone to be 200% of their #. They expect 80% of the reps to miss their #. The territories are extremely disparate. There's a lot of partiality in who gets what accounts. Be very careful when you join as an AE. For other roles like Marketing, Ops etc I've heard its a good place to work. However, for Sales its just like any other company. Dont fall for their lies when they tell you that the territories are fair. To give you a specific example, in the Toronto office there is one person who has 10 president's clubs. He makes a lot of money and his manager and his manager's manager are as expected totally aligned. He is a good rep. However, so are others on the team. However since he has always had the best territory the makes club every single year. Its ridiculous. If you've been in sales for a while, and comes across an environment where ONE person has made club 10 times and every one else has made club 1-2 times in the last 10 years, what would you conclude. The territories are uneven. The management is inept. For example this is the first company that I've come across where the Sales Manager's quota is not aligned with the team. For example in a team of 10 sales reps which a quota of $1M each, the manager doesnt have a $10M quota. His/her quota is way less than that. So even if the team misses their #, the manager makes his/her #. I had never seen that in my sales career. So to get promoted to a manager's role, you need to be connected to the right people. Be very careful in joining this company. For Sales its not as advertised. For other roles it might be different."

509,4.0,no cons as of now
510,3.0,"Career progression and salary increases are 100% related to the personal brand and not to quantifiable results, this leads people to abuse of the internal social networking platform and any other brown nosing opportunity for self promotion. This may be a plus if you have that attitude, otherwise you will find it frustrating. Due to this, management is represented by some excellent managers and others who are not but have been good in leveraging the above. Salesforce as a family: you are expected to be enthusiastic, participate and promote all sort of social events they serve you. Opting out of something you are not interested in lowers your personal brand. Work-life balance is hard: stressful days masked by great fun on social media, work in the weekend is not uncommon."
511,3.0,None that I see yet

524,4.0,- Could be greater transparency
525,4.0,"The company is at something of a crossroads, wedded to some of the disadvantages of its start-up mentality: thinking can be short-term, with decisions accordingly myopic, and there is too great a value placed on the diving-catch. Too many fire-drills and a small number of capricious senior leaders who have been around for 10 - 15 years behaving in the same way. It is tiresome, disruptive and frankly counter-cultural but their tenure appears to make them untouchable."
526,4.0,"- Depending on your role, your manager might not support the VTO during work hours - Depending on your role, you might not have any male salaries to compare against - The company and larger industry is still male-dominated, and you will still come up against entrenched sexism, this isn't utopia - ""Drinking from the fire hydrant"" is the work load. You either step up or leave during probation. If you do step up, you will reach your limit, then be overloaded again. If you're a workaholic and can balance that in a healthy way, great, but SFDC plays lip service to work-life balance in many departments. The work-life balance is often achieved through working from home while your family is asleep. - 99% of opportunities outside of the USA are sales-focussed"
527,3.0,"There are plenty of politics surrounding promotions and territories. It's not what you know, but who you know and party with. In general my coworkers were bright people. I met some of my best friends there. Working along side smart, motivated people kept me sharp, but there were also people dumb as rocks. Because it's such a large sales group some bright ones never got to shine and some rocks never got exposed and are still there after many many years."
528,4.0,Sometimes difficult to keep up with the tasks
529,5.0,"The days off allowance is following the average of Singapore standards: 15 days. It will be great to have more. However, Salesforce offers flexibility on working from home or different country location."
530,3.0,"no worklife balance, hours busy"
531,5.0,- Increasing lack of transparency from upper management. - Growth having a negative affect on standards and culture. - Recent introduction of hot desking has turned the office into an impersonal and unwelcoming place to be. It's cost savings at the expense of employees interests. - Uncertainty over future unified office location in Dublin.
532,5.0,"Worst management - They will never listen to you. They'll only do what they want to do and all your ideas will be given to others and they are projected as their ideas. Totally biased and even after multiple feedbacks with the proofs they do not want to accept. They will always tell, there's more to come in the future stay tuned. It's not about promotions or hike percentages. It's about ethics and integrity which the management will oversee always. Sometimes it's clearly evident and visible to everyone in the team that something wrong is happening and the local leadership in Hyderabad, never want to fix it. They just want to bypass it saying the (people who get support from management) trying to do something extra why don't you support him instead of giving feedback. Later, the people who actually want to work as a team and share some feedback with the managers will be targeted big time and will be treated as like slaves or even worst them, Support - Worst support that I have seen in the service industry. These guys never understand its a product based support, not a BPO. With Salesforce having three releases a year with all upgradations & patches, it will be difficult for a support person to keep up to date all the time. The worst way of calculation with regards to the headcount. They say they're hiring people but for a quarter 50 people for a backlog and burden of thousands of cases is not working. Outdated metrics are being used to calculate productivity and other year-end calculations. Employee Success or HR: Apart from very few members Zaira Banu & Rajesh I do not see others responding to the questions raised by the employees. I'm not biased towards the above two but however, their work speaks for themselves. Now coming to the recruitment, Salesforce always recommends the employees to refer people to the organisation, however, the recruitment or referral process is worst (there is no other least word for this). I have referred around 10 profiles to this organisation, all the profiles haven't been considered. They stay in the first or second stage for almost 2 to 3 months and then the status changes to No longer in consideration. When we try to contact the recruiter there will be no response. FYI, the above mentioned 10 profiles have been selected in other organisations for better positions and better packages. It's clearly evident on the floor that there is an agreement between the manager and the respective team member. The team member will refer people and the respective manager will select that profile. Once the team member gets the referral bonus it will be shared by the team member(who referred to the profile) and the manager who recruited."
533,1.0,"Achieving your target depends heavily on the distribution of accounts/opportunities and therefore on luck and/or on the appreciation of your manager when (s)he distributes accounts and related opportunities. Salesforce managers refer to equality as an important principle, but some individuals seem more equal than others.. Most sales do not attain their targets in Belgium and base salary is low. There’s even people earning more on mileage expense than on base salary and commissions combined for several months. Be careful when stories are told before you sign your contract about very high salaries in case of going above your target. Almost none of the sales achieve >100% of their target and you typically enter without getting any decent opportunities. This obviously allows for direct pressure from the start. Poor package of benefits overall (e.g. no company car despite fiscal advantages in Belgium and not even a sales allowance/'representatievergoeding'). Unless if you’re one of the lucky few who goes well above targets. Very poor culture in Belgium in particular and poor coaching as well in my view. Also, in my case, there were several issues with payments, with Salesforce claiming that they would start paying (still waiting for payments now that were due more than a month ago). They don’t seem to care about local laws and rules in a small country to them like Belgium."
534,2.0,"If you like Kool-Aid, have a knack for never questioning things, and don't care much for integrity, this is the place for you! Worst office politics I've experienced - conflicting goals across teams created tension between managers which trickled down to staff. Goal posts were constantly changing and never reaching a resolve. One particular manager was notoriously difficult to work with and had a reputation for bullying, playing favouritism, and making most people feel uncomfortable by employing a management style of intimidation. Despite multiple HR violations against him for his aggressive behaviour, nothing was ever done to rectify it. You're not encouraged to work as a team, but instead, encouraged to develop ways of getting ahead of others through sometimes unethical means. Middle management will overlook any unethical, throwing-under-the-bus behaviours if it means you help them hit their numbers and make them look good. Nurtures a cutthroat environment of arrogance and greed. The company spends far too much energy talking itself up to its employees (#dreamjob) and customers without following through with the goods."
535,4.0,No cons I can identify till now
536,5.0,They will make you work for the promotions. Example: you do 200% of your sales target and you're next in line for a promotion. Management will tap 3 people. You have now earned the right to interview for a promotion. You will be given a case study to present to senior directors. You will get beaten up in this meeting far beyond what any customer would put you through. At the end 1 of the 3 people will be selected to move up. The other 2 go back and wait until they are tapped again for a promotion. I watched a few friends depart due to not getting their promotion.
537,5.0,"- Hours are long, especially at the end of quarters, occasional weekend required - Occasionally too politically correct - Very sales team focused, all other areas can be made to feel like you are 2nd best to them - Split offices mean that most events and senior management locate themselves in one. As based in the other it can lead to a distant feeling. - My team don't do many events or socialising outside the office, but many others do"
538,1.0,- Ex-Microsoft employee factory in infrastructure org. - No innovation or automation opportunities provided across multiple teams especially in infrastructure delivery. - Silo teams/individuals working for their own growth and stock renewals. - Lack of transparency from Ex-MSFT Management. - Cross-cloud collaboration is worst. - People outside HQ (San Francisco/US) are left to their own fate. - No encouragement from local managers on career growth. - No encouragement from local leadership to participate in OOM.

541,3.0,"Feel like I work in a cult sometimes (or drinking the ""kool-aid"") - the culture feels superficial and fake. Lots of lip service paid to being best place to work but the level of politics is demoralising and leadership is largely uninspiring working in pre-sales makes me feel like I have to be at the beck and call of the account execs. While most account execs are nice, there are some that make life a misery. As long as these account execs being in business, any bullying or manipulative behaviour is overlooked oracle people taking over the enterprise business. Culture there is terrible. Bullying culture prevalent. HR or ""employee success"" turn a blind eye - largely ineffectual."
542,5.0,Relentless pace of sales growth and hiring is not necessarily matched and or paralleled by peripheral and other business units leading to occasional flares but nothing major. Also lack of focus on managing out the people that need to move on to greener pastures. Overall great benefits and nice work hard/play hard mentality. Increasing pressure on target achievement as they hire more and more salespeople reducing their territories whilst maintaining 30% yoy growth

554,5.0,"Internal job movements are not happening, no option but to look out of company to grow."
555,2.0,"Despite not wanting to acknowledge this fact, Salesforce is an incredibly political company to progress in. There is a heavy process around advancement, the main activity being developing your own brand. This involves gaining sponsors at various levels and promoting yourself (sometimes unashamedly) heavily throughout the business. This 'brand campaigning' is by definition political. It is also biased towards those that have the time to commit to it. It is largely dependant on a full and present management chain and those who are actually fully active making a difference at their customers, or who are under resourced and performing multiple roles to serve their customer, do not get the chance to 'seize the opportunity that Salesforce states that it presents. The result is that the talent in the business feel undervalued and the promotions go to the people who have shouted the loudest. It is a real shame, Salesforce isn't the company that I wanted it to be."

559,2.0,"I have worked in other companies before and Salesforce seemed great in the beginning but its really the new Oracle in a disguise. * High turnover of staff * Nepotism / 'Boys Club' environment * No transparency * The internal promotion process is questionable * Cheating to hit targets, quid pro quo if you have a network * Management will not listen to feedback (expect that they turn it against you) * Hard to maintain work/life balance * Ohana is just marketing * Micro management * No lunch at all and the breakfast is just cereal * The office location is far away from the centre"

566,2.0,"Old, phone-based, lack of value selling method. Lots of integrity issues and politics. I have been selling at a number of different firms and this is the worst so far. I'd stay away unless you're ready to kiss up to superiors and grind without proper coaching. Most importantly the competitive anxiety and lack of vulnerability is crippling."
567,2.0,"- Working from home is absolutely forbidden despite many of your colleagues living in different cities. - 4 sick days a year. If you take any more time from that, you'll then have to use your PTO hours. We get paid hourly, and they do not allow unpaid time off. - 8:30am to 5:00pm standard hours. Not sure why the extra half hour is needed. Don't even think of trying to leave at 4:57pm, even if you are crushing your targets. - Pay is below industry standard but most will argue, ""But you get to put Salesforce on your resume"". Most external hires take a lower salary than their previous job and oddly wear that as a badge of honour. That's how Salesforce executives want you to feel. The CEO is a billionaire, he didn't get there by paying his employees fairly. - Good luck trying to change departments if you ever feel like making a lateral move within the company. Salesforce has a policy stating you must stay in the same role for a minimum of 1.5 years before being allowed to move laterally into a different segment of the business. - Don't let them fool you with their ""best workplace"" awards. You won't feel that way in sales here."

569,5.0,Other people money hard work
570,5.0,1. Working remote require some business trips every couple months
571,2.0,"Since the company is growing fast , all sort of people are there in middle management and these people are not following the basic Ohana culture of salesforce which Marc is dreaming about. If you are from an acquired company and not into salesforce tech stack, then be very careful , you will be fired immediately after your knowledge transfer and if they feel that you are no more required to carry on with the work, even though you had spent years together in the acquired company to build the product. No help whatsoever from HR or hiring managers for internal openings even though you learn and get certified in salesforce related technologies."
572,5.0,salesforce specific frameworks to work with
573,2.0,"From the Professional Services Department point of view, there is a lack of opportunities for internal promotions as the management seems to prefer hiring externally most of the time rather than giving a chance to employees that have been developing very hard themselves for the next opportunity; lack of support for professional development with a significant slow down in investing in external trainings and certifications; a lack of transparency towards the consultants that get updated at the last minute about internal changes; quite some room for improvement with regards to resource management as consultants are unclear on what they are meant to be working a week ahead or in terms of priorities and are demanded to do the extra mile every mile; and finally buggy new products that take several years to get almost fixed"
574,3.0,"Management or lack of Management. Misunderstanding in selling solutions - so many solutions when faced with a customer can become confusing to the customer what exactly they are speaking to SF.com about. Is it a CRM, Marketing Platform, Lead gen, Web Personalisation, Ad platform, Services?? I feel the AE's are sometimes spread to thin with so much to offer."
575,3.0,"1. If you're hired as ""Success Agent Tier-2"" for CRM support then your Salesforce career is over because you'll be working in a specific skill group (Configuration, Usage or Email team) and do not get any chance to explore the real Salesforce CRM tool. 2. Management do not to monitor/plan their employees leaves(PTO's) properly which again makes very difficult to work with a huge backlog of cases. You can expect 25-30 cases per agent in AMER shift or 30-35 cases per agent in EMEA shift. NOTE: I have worked in Wipro (worst of all IT companies) so I am very well aware of overload/ extra amount of work. 3. They do not have enough ""Tier-3"" resource which makes your life miserable because as Tier-2, you'll be the only point of contact for the customer who has raised a case. If customer escalates the case or gives you DSAT due to the delay in resolution, then it won't affect Tier-3's performance. Management will simply blame you. 4. So many bugs/ Known issues in every major releases which will make you cry like hell as a support agent. 5. If you ask CSG management to hire more resources to reduce the back log, they'll simply say - ""No we cannot because we do not have enough budget"". 6. HR team sends out an employee survey link in each quarter but that doesn't make any change in your work life. 7. Also when it comes to ""Employee referral""(if your friends, relatives or siblings gets hired then you get $2000/each) program in Hyderabad is one of the most ""Corrupted"" program they've. I have seen 3 examples of corruption in referrals where managers referred their siblings who has really good terms with the ""hiring manager"". They all got selected and each manager earned easy $2000 + Family member (as a salesforce employee). So again if you're hired as Success agent Tier-2 then forget about referring anyone. 8. No way you will get Onsite chance. Strict policy. Also please do not dream of getting free passes/visit to Dreamforce event especially if you're in India. ()"
576,2.0,"Very toxic culture. The issue with Salesforce is that there are so many people lined up for working there, that they simply do not care about the long-term well-being of their employees. Salesforce is a machine, you will be put in it, use you for everything your worth, and they will spit you out and move on to the next one. Most people would say that this is what sales is like, but no, Salesforce is a beast of its own when it comes to pushing people to their limit. Furthermore, the pay really isn't that great for a sales job in tech. Maybe it was good 5 years ago? Not now, though."
577,5.0,Salesforce is a rapidly growing company and sometimes it can be hard to find the right people to talk too. But the internal social network helps a lot.
578,4.0,Ever seen that episode of Black Mirror with Bryce Dallas Howard where she constantly chases positive social ratings in order to keep her place in society? That's whats its like at SF. Faking constant positivity can be draining. Its genuine with most folks but when you have 'real talk' many folks don't take it well. I was there for 3 Fiscal Years and had my territory reduced by 50% and my quota rise by 50% every year. The 3rd time my patch became too small to hit the high quota. Sales mgmt would rather have 10 reps make 60% than 6 reps make 100%. Work-Life balance is tough too. Pressure for growth is massive on RVPs so it rolls down hill. Maintaining 25% growth has an impact on the front lines.
579,1.0,"I have seen many reviews but no action yet. We only see the canned response. Biggest mistake by getting employees and management from Call centre culture. 2. Spoiled the work culture. Most of them doesn’t have knowledge or attitude to work in company like Salesforce. They are fit for BPO only. Salesforce values now changed from Trust to No-Trust. Now the culture is Politics, backstabbing, data manipulation. There was saying Getting into Salesforce is harder than getting into Harvard university. This doesn’t apply for Hyd CSG. Criteria for hyd CSG:- 1. Referred by Management 2. Wife can refer husband and vice-versa. True ohana can be seen here. Husband and wife working in same team, shift, and manager. Though we have policy around it, who cares need to focus on Ohana. If not in same team it’s very easy to work in same shift. Doesn’t make sense reaching out to ES as they are the one who gives offer letters. Promotion criteria:- management favourite. Need to know how to play politics. Backstabbing and how to get numbers. Management is afraid to take actions against non performers and people with wrong attitudes which actually spoiled the entire culture. list will go on..."
580,5.0,"-Reduced work-life balance due to bi-monthly business travels required to identify opportunities to build pipeline -Geographical distance from customers who are based in country -Growing sales teams means accounts per AE getting fewer with the targets not getting smaller -""Flexforce"" no seats assigned to AE -Weekly forecasting with monthly forecasts might not be suitable to everyone"
581,4.0,"The organization is growing rapidly, hence new members of staff from different companies with different organizational structures and cultures are joining. Management needs to ensure that Salesforce's original culture is preserved. This counts for senior level employees with directs as well as for young professionals. Understand why Salesforce is different and keep it unique as opposed to the other players in our industry."
582,5.0,"It is a fast growing, large company with a complex org structure. Navigating the right teams and people takes time, but everyone is willing to help you."
583,5.0,"- Sometimes seems like a company where you'd be better off joining after a few years elsewhere, rather than kicking off your career due to what seems like unfair promotions"

585,5.0,I do not see any cons
586,5.0,"- Offices are very far from the city centre, even though it's going to change by 2022"
587,5.0,I don't really have a bad word to say apart from it maybe getting a little too big now so territories are becoming a little small.
588,1.0,"Looks like a superb company from the outside with good benefit & culture. Under the lid is a toxic, back stabbing culture with products driven by marketing & apple polishing. Products are written with outmoded design & scattered codes which obviously were forced to push into the production because the upper leadership need stuff to put in their release notes so they can keep touting about their “innovation” and “progressiveness”. Customer Supports are the most pitiful people I have ever seen given that they have to support the products that are not even documented whatsoever and the product managers are ditching them being unresponsive & supportive. The company needs to grow in order to keep their investors pleased however almost all territories in all regions are already saturated so they are now being forced to riskier moves - riskier M&A like tableau and territory like China. The yet worst part is that I saw managers solicited good reviews on Glassdoor or Vorkers in Japan so I seriously doubt how true are other positive reviews..."
589,5.0,"- organizational setup could be better - lack of knowledge about how to get things done, since most people have only recently joined the company"
590,4.0,A bit slow for beginners. Initial years in career should be spent on much more learning as compared to what is achieved here. Career focussed on Salesforce platform in the beginning itself.

599,1.0,"- Poor work-life balance, it’s all about work. Late night messages and sometimes those bringing call for action for next morning.. And this is getting worse as all management layers feel the need to “contribute”.. - Customer success has changed to customer second; this is confirmed as common view in recent employee survey. It’s all about running the revenue up, on cost of some customers being outright screwed over under time pressure from us. It’s terrible to see this change, having been following this great company for many years. - You get promoted by making your numbers. You can be as disrespectful to Salesforce values as you wish to be, as far as the numbers are on the board. This is not a nice environment to work in. This is a shark tank.. - We are taught to be hustlers. We make stories of how great the prices are in certain month and how my manager has a budget for the extra discounts He would like to spend with you as a special customer. Big news: the discounts are always available for those willing to actually buy and there are no budgets for “special discounts”.. The only big diversion from this is January, when it truly is a buyers market. - It is high pressure, always. - Office is too full, and no home office allowed. - Ohana, trust, customer success - these are just words in Sales slides."
600,3.0,Extremely unrealistic targets. High pressure on 30% YOY growth. 95% of AEs don´t hit monthly targets which creates a lot of low morale across the board. A lot of politics; you must shmooze the right Senior Managers to get anywhere. A lot of arrogance as well by certain Directors/RVPs who won´t give people who don´t play the game the time of day. The culture has been highly tailored and well thought out to retain staff - if you enjoy cheesey happy clappy culture with no thought as to the reason behind it then you´ll enjoy it! Base salary is well below market rate.

602,5.0,"It’s somehow hard to get the work-life balance, long working hours are unavoidable . However, this is often compensated by flexible working."
603,5.0,Huge amount of work and poor balance between pro and private life (please notice that this is my personal experience.) Paris’s office is too small and crowded for all the employees.
604,2.0,"Line managers follow archaic software development practices. Little unit testing, test driven development and paired programming. Many mediocre developers churn out reams of untested, buggy, bloated code, adding to old, complex, monolithic code base. Very slow and buggy build and test automation system makes development incredibly slow and painful. Senior people accept the status quo. Hiring process is slow and unreliable. Internal systems complex and fragmented."
605,1.0,"- Completely focuses on sales, nothing else. All that matters to them is hitting quarterly numbers. - High Churn of people due to lack of training, management and high pressured cooker demanding instant results. - Poor leadership in place - often people who have done well put into management positions with no exp or people skills. - Zero career development and growth. - No culture - you will just be another number. - Many people unresponsive and hiding. - Very political and packed with egos. - management seem to ignore and look down on more junior employees as beneath them. - Poor communication to employees."
606,5.0,IT industry changes very fast and processes changes from time to time. You have to be adaptable and focus on what matters
607,5.0,"- work/personal life balance: you need to be always on, even during vacation/outside of regular business hours - multiple acquisitions of other companies often requires modifying internal processes and structure (every fiscal year org structure seems to change - this may be a good or bad thing depending on your point of view)"
608,2.0,"Company has grown so much it feels it has trouble keeping up with itself. Company utilizes Google GSuite which doesn't work too smoothly with Apple or Microsoft products and hardware. You can get your work done, but if you are used to select your own tools or if you come from a Microsoft dominated environment you better be prepared for this as the impact to your productivity may be big in the beginning. The biggest problem to me has been that the Senior Management is not always on a level that I would expect them to be. There is a lot of variance in how they set the expectations, support their subordinates and especially how they present themselves as leaders. Maybe it is bad luck or maybe I'm not the right fit for the company, but this has also made me consider my options with other employers."
609,5.0,> Salesforce growth is such that processes are heavier and HR can no longer devote time to people.
610,5.0,"It's a work hard, play hard culture, and we move fast, so if you aren't ready/willing to put in the inputs, it might not be the right sales job for you."
611,3.0,Sales can be extremely unfair environment. If your Manager likes you or you are simply lucky (30% of people) you can land a great territory or a double territory and do very well. Not just financially but you will feel valued by the business and respected. If you are one of the 70% that are not in this category - you will find it extremely hard to do well.
612,3.0,"- Despite what is promised repeatedly, there is no real possibility to change department when you're in a career path, especially in sales. - Very high pressure and targets in Sales - CONSTANTLY monitored: Salesforce is the leader in cloud CRM and knows very well how to use its tools to control its employees every single activity and everyday actions, can be quite annoying at times - Uneven between markets: mature markets have a very easy life compared to less matured markets (in monthly targets, promotion criteria, visibility within company, etc.)"
613,4.0,Complexity and lack of simplification

618,5.0,super high paced organisation with massive growth number
619,5.0,"It is a very serious job, you have to really embrace it and be prepared to be thoroughly tested. Don't be lulled into a false sense of comfort by the West Coast vibe - sure, there are massive upsides from the amazing culture (especially 'Trust""), but they don't just give jobs away. Decide first: I am going to fully embrace the Salesforce world, if you do, you will find this the most amazing, satisfying company on the planet.to work for."

621,5.0,"No Cons, really good benefits"
622,5.0,It sometimes takes them until 9:30am to provide fresh fruit
623,2.0,"Very unfriendly, uncaring sales environment in enterprise sales - sink or swim attitude, don't care about customers just want to make the numbers and grow. Treat sales people like dispensable soldiers, hire 100, lose 50 hire another 100 - people arrive and just disappear a few months later, some only last a few months. Many of the leaders come from Oracle. Not many people make commission - targets are very difficult to achieve."
624,2.0,I joined this company with great aspiration and my dream shattered within a couple of weeks. From Managers to Upper Management in AMER shift in India craves for CSAT ...they push engineers to pitch surveys... total breach with customer ethics and core values of salesforce. Support Agent is like a survey machine nothing more than that...in fact the team never cares about the learning and enhancing the skills of Engineers. Rather find a way to get the good survey. I left the company in frustration due to these malpractices and learning curve was zero.
625,5.0,Extremely busy role with veryoften not enough hours in the day to achieve the days goals. Late nights and weekend work sometimes required to complete a project but the salary and benefits outweigh this negative and the company is very appreciative. Recruitment process is long and intense to ensure you are a proper fit for the company / culture / team you are joining.
626,4.0,"Competitive in a ""Crabs in a barrel"" sort of way Young Management that doesn't necessarily know how to lead Fast growth model causes a lot of changes in the same areas over and over again Constant rebranding gets confusing, even for the employees! Sales staff is treated far superior than other staff Because the ""Customer is always right"", they will let clients practically abuse you and you will get dinged for it"
627,4.0,"The job itself can be quite repetitive and not that challenging at times and there seems to be little exposure to other teams, meaning it might be more difficult to develop and move around within the company. Training is very weak - Much of the job involves on-the-job learning. Marketing Cloud exists because SF bought out Exact Target. There seems to be a divide between Marketing Cloud and the rest of the business business, meaning less integration with other areas of the business, but this slowly seems to be aligning. Furthermore. the majority of the MC team are based in the US, which means working together often. Although, this isn't an issue, it feels as the UK team are in the US team's shadow."
628,5.0,"Political, which is a given with the growth; middle management do not receive training in managing people and are often on power trips (likely based on insecurity); territories are far from equal and the company will double up territories for those they want to promote to make them look good and justify the promotion; too many people eg overlays, excessive levels of management trying to justify why they are employed and create a lot of extra work for AE's; takes away from selling and caring for the customers. Too much 'AE Enablement'...AE's are now Customer Success, Technical Support, Operations, Sales Engineers as instead of hiring resources, everyone wants to train AE's to do their job...not a good use of high paid employees and takes away from productivity and revenue driving activities. As AE's you are pretty much seen as a number and stat to 'stay in the box' without a lot of autonomy on how to spend your day. Lots of burnout if you get sucked into the monthly 'life or death' culture to meet quota or be ashamed."
629,4.0,"- Anyone can only select if you have any referral candidates from internal employees within the team. Example - there are 4 interviewers in DB team Singapore. First round will be done by the lead which is real and logical interview and the second round will be taken by any of the senior member in the team. You will able to shortlist the second round only if you know anyone within that team else they will simply reject you in second round. For example, if person A refer someone and if he rejected in first round then whoever attend the interview on second round either one in the team will reject you This is happening for past more than a year"
630,5.0,Like any business it can hire some poor managers. It takes people in from rival businesses and whereas they often bring new and strong ideas on how Salesforce can develop they can also bring an old fashioned IT industry attitude of negative pressure and blame.
631,5.0,"Salesforce is not for everyone - cultural fit is essential. I would recommend that you investigate what makes Salesforce different in our Ohana Trailhead badge. If it resonates with you, then join in!"
632,5.0,"Political, onboarding(first 12 months) are hard, more corporate than they say, not for everyone (you really need to be able and willing to keep changing in your role, in teams and opportunities are fast paced)"
633,5.0,- speed of the companies growth hinders process creation - tools: lots of spreadsheets when it could be in an IT tool - budget restrictions all the time
634,1.0,The UK SE management team are experts in killing talents and disregarding industry experience. Every SE manager has been given a quota to hire and promote certain number of women and young people and they are so single minded that they completely brush aside some of their top talents . Their strategic & top SEs are the most unsung heroes and instead everyone keep singing the praise of the grads which is such a short sighted view and in a long run they are going to lose their top performers .
635,5.0,"Very HQ centric on big decisions and authority, but this is changing in the regions, albeit not as fast as it could"
636,5.0,"More as a side-effect of a large and also fast-growing company, there might be some occasional (ad-hoc) bureaucracy in some activities. Furthermore, some temporary lack of integration (information/communication) with the Headquarters and major branches can also be felt, especially by new acquisitions or alliances."
637,5.0,Rapid organisational changes takes time to manifest.
638,5.0,I have do not have any.
639,4.0,Salesforce is huge and there are so many products with a lot of acquisitions happening. You might feel lost sometimes.

642,5.0,"Time Commitment, Travel, Demanding, Very limited cons"
643,5.0,There is an expectation to fully engage within the culture both in and out of the office. Work/life balance will always be a challenge if you plan to get in at 9 and leave at 5.

645,5.0,N/A Keep doing what you are doing!
646,2.0,"Office location can be bad for some people, since it is located in Sandyford. Management was really bad at that time, worst I´ve ever seen. They were micromanaging employees in a ridiculous way, I really hope things are changing now. There is no proper canteen. Work life balance was very bad too, support is an easy job and nearly stress free, they make it a nightmare. I wonder what would happen if these guys need to handle real projects. In summary, support shouldn´t be done the way Salesforce is doing it, they should take a peek at other companies. Also, no trips to the U.S. for support. Salesforce is an awesome company, but be careful when joining support in Dublin."
647,5.0,"Very very very few. Small signs of getting too big, slower decision making. In some cases too much committee management"
648,4.0,"- still poor HR-level (following former reviews) - to keep grows revenue rate high almost all markets are over hired - achieving almost impossible - getting a job in salesforce depends who receives your CV, you have good people in low level jobs and people after university degree in higher level jobs, it all depends where your CV is routed to - getting a promotion is very political, seems easier to get a job from outside the company instead an internal promotion"
649,5.0,If you come from a development background and expecting to further your technical skills - this is not the place for you. You will notice a dip if you don't keep on top of the tech world outside work This is just the nature of the business
650,3.0,"While working at salesforce, I got the sense that management knows the right thing to say, but ultimately doesn't act in a way that's consistent with their message. For example, there's a huge emphasis on employee growth but it seems more attention is spent retaining ""old guard"" than giving other staff opportunities to grow. And despite appearing on ""best employers"" lists, the hours are pretty hard and the equity package (RSUs/options) is one of the worst in the Valley."
651,2.0,"Here I am going to give reviews about salesforce demo eng team based in India. A lot of comparison between the team members which demoralise you every day. No technical manager/leader/boss in India. Flattery always works like a charm with the leaders. Team do not follow ""no gift policy"". Leaders of this team love to take expensive gifts from the team members. You can enjoy lunch for hours and hours if you are with mangers of this team. Very strict rules for office timing (9:30 you reach office or you better be prepared for the day). Though this rule is not applicable for leaders of this team. Mangers/Leaders put lot of pressure to get 5 out of 5 star from the clients you are working with. You will learn the high politics in very early age of career"
652,5.0,No cons currently - a thoroughly enjoyable place to work
653,5.0,"There’s no sensibility from the manager about the work that you do about responsibility and if you can do it, they just drop to you the job that you need to do, but if you can do it, as I did you get a lot experience."
654,5.0,Opportunities for advancement outside of sales were limited
655,2.0,"- India offices treated as offshore with menial work coming in - India support functions (hiring, operations, employee service etc) don't really understand situations the employees are in and are pretty insensitive. If you incur expenses, as a consequence of company request, not covered in the policy, come what may the India Employee Operations team would be against reimbursing them even if you have your Director or Vice President's approval - No Ohana feeling. Its just a word used for PR"

672,1.0,"Worst company I have ever worked for. Worst managers ever, heartless and ruthless. If your stats are fine all is good with the world but may god help you if you go below threshold. And if they don't like you it won't even matter, simple as that. A few exceptions aside a fine team motto would have been ""every man for himself"" This is a good environment nonetheless for anybody into deceit, grovelling and all things fake, if that is the case let me assure you will have a wonderful time."
673,5.0,Difficult to maintain work/life balance
674,4.0,To improve the sale of company products
675,5.0,Hard working environment No more Cons
676,4.0,Work life balance isn’t great
677,1.0,"No information has been given beforehand that a certain amount of certifications had to be passed first, which comes as an utter surprise to everyone when they start and is adding a lot of pressure to an already stressful situation as a new hire. It was already suspicious that half of the team got rehired at the same time, but it turned out that this team had generally an extremely high turnover. The job itself was absolutely not challenging as it was merely an entry-level position, but immediately after joining we got told that there is a hiring freeze for the next months. It turned out that nobody for years had been given the chance to move to other teams. I got yelled at by the manager in the most unprofessional way and learned that this was normal there in this team. Well, it's not normal and absolutely not acceptable at all! I can only warn everyone to join who hopes this position could be a good start with Salesforce. It's a dead-end street! Any reports to HR end in an immediate procedure to cut the reporter off as a trouble maker. They won't even provide a reference or even a reference letter. Asked for my P45 frequently and received finally someone else's P60 in the end."
678,1.0,Working on weekends and holidays Stress Lots of hires and lots of fired employees - high turnover
679,3.0,"Underpay compared to other technology companies in 'growth' mode. - managers focus strictly on numbers, little coaching or mentorship - work/life balance is a blurred line; focus hard on your numbers yet cap your working hours at 45 a week - moving away from flexible work hours and remote based employees - culture is no longer a focus"
680,5.0,Nothing cons as the company is very good
681,5.0,"Can be very exhaustive to keep up. Change is the new constant, so you are always learning and re-learning. Easy to get distracted as there are many events and charities you are encouraged to be a part of. At end of day, you are responsible for your own KPIs, so time management is essential"
682,5.0,- Creeping bureaucracy with some metrics apparently being collected for the sake of it - Rapid change can make it a challenge to keep up - Career paths outside of the USA are a little opaque
683,5.0,"Pace: SF moves fast. Change is constant. You need to be comfortable being uncomfortable. This is not for everyone. If you're looking to rest on your laurels in a comfy position, you need not apply. Fiscal Year: this is a petty gripe but a valid one. The SF fiscal year ends January 31st, which means Christmas/New Year timeframe is one of the our busiest times of year. Taking vacation in December/January is highly discouraged given it's the busy season, not ideal if you're accustomed to taking time off for the holidays. Cross-Functional Collaboration: compared with most companies I've seen, we do a great job of collaborating across departments/functions to get the job done. Some would say we're world class in this department, but as a SF veteran my expectations are high and I think we can do better. At times certain departments feel misaligned and for us to continue growing we need to move as one tightly aligned organization."
684,5.0,- Stressful targets (as any sales environment) - Sometimes gets very very challenging - Some managers can be really pain in the neck - Your image makes a strong impression on your next step
685,5.0,"At this moment I honestly cannot think of any legitimate cons to working for Salesforce. Any company will have unique challenges which will require adjustment on the part of staff, and Salesforce is no different. That isn't a con, but merely reality."
686,5.0,Takes more time to explain the topics
687,5.0,Pains and politics from growing fast. Flat management structure makes it challenging to understand career path in the company. Products and platforms and their nomenclature are constantly changing which can be a challenge to keep up and stay aligned and then communicate effectively to the customer sometimes.
688,5.0,"These are more Heroku issues than Salesforce issues. We were (and still are) strapped for headcount over many years. This leads to serious team health issues and burnout. Exec is keenly aware of the issue and taking steps to fix it, but it should never have gotten this bad. At the moment, our product org is also sorely understaffed following turnover and departures, which means that many engineering teams don't have anyone to help them make sound product choices. We get by, but the product roles are critical, and the product managers we have are spread way too thin. As above, our exec team is aware of the problem and trying to hire as fast as they can. These are short- to medium-term issues. I believe they'll get worked out and we'll have smoother sailing in a few months. Longer term, my larger concern is complacency. I don't know if Heroku/Salesforce has the gumption to make the big bets to really grow our business and remain relevant for the next epoch. For the last decade we've made it drastically simpler to run compute workloads in the cloud, and it's built a large and successful business. With containerization catching on and tooling becoming more mature, we're being commoditized. I don't know that exec has the appetite to determine what the next ""git push heroku master"" is, and allocate enough resources to pursue it. That feels like an existential threat."
689,5.0,- A lot of sales jobs are now being lost to other offices (US or Canada) - Base Salary is very low (but you will make up on it as OTE is pretty certain if you work hard)
690,4.0,"People are people, and unfortunately not all people managers should be. That happens at all companies though."
691,4.0,"At Salesforce everybody should be able to sell. Under a relative strong sale pressure ambiance, you need to accept to live with daily uncertainty and the discomfort of not having complete information, easy answers or obvious solutions."
692,5.0,I can't say that there are any cons.
693,5.0,"We work way too much. It's not necessarily that there's management pressure for it, but we just feel passionate about the company and our work, so we end up working all the time. It takes conscious personal and management efforts to ensure we stick to not working, evenings, on weekends and holidays."
694,5.0,"Nothing as of now. No company provided transport, maybe HR can review and address this concern. Also need to ensure that the culture at hyderabad is consistent with that in HQ, San Francisco"
695,4.0,"Work life balance in services non-existent. Company grew too fast to keep up with the great team dynamic that made it such a creative, exciting, progressive place to work. US did not understand non-US jurisdictions and had not desire to do so. US tried to make it an overly structured, regimented corporate when it's greatest asset was it's agile, non-conformist style that enabled creativity, intrapreneurship and great teamwork"
696,5.0,Salesforce is extremely HQ centric . While not a complete con - A lot of the company's growth is fueled through inorganic acquisition as opposed to organic efforts within the company.
697,5.0,The only regret I have is that I didn't apply to work here sooner.
698,5.0,"Being such a big company you typically only work on small portion of the bigger picture at a time, but this isn't necessarily a con. It's just the nature of being a large company."
699,5.0,"The work is tough and a lot is expected, however I wouldn't list this as a black and white con, as I believe that what we get in return is more than enough to justify workload."
700,4.0,"Further up the EMEA org the Ohana culture does seem to be getting ""thinner"" and is more of a word than a genuine way of working. Especially in the enterprise sales organisation there can be some ""prima-donna"" behaviour - seems there are some top sales people in leadership positions based on their sales skills rather than their leadership skills."
701,2.0,"- Constant changes (whether to which team you're on, or your job description) - Promotion path is convuluted (interview, get approved, and they decide they want to close the position and then constantly will make you re-interview for the same position you were once approved for. Could be waiting 4 months+ after acceptance - Work hard, and only hard. Play doesn't really exist here. - Passive aggressive directors that will never tell you ""Good job"" when hitting 100% of your metrics, micro-focused - Culture isn't what it's cracked up to be (sadly). Backstabbing, and bullying tendencies from other team members - business makes the best decisions for the business completely not acknowledging the toll it puts on employees (ie. 35% YoY growth, which is great, but comes with a cost) - Work life balance in positions that come after BDR are apparently non-existent"
702,2.0,"Mediocre management in Indian operations ( not Hyderabad ), Indian Sales Team. Local leadership( across levels and businesses) politics and attitude"
703,2.0,Unachievable targets/quotas. About 95% of Account Executives miss their number every month. High turnover of sales staff. Salesforce really don’t care about their customers. It is all about 30% yoy growth.
704,5.0,Middle management is not good
705,5.0,Nothing as of my current experience
706,5.0,The instructions for final presentation were not aligned with interviewers expectation which resulted in me being hired one level lower
707,2.0,Too much internal meeting and processes
708,5.0,It is a big company with many people. Sometimes hard to find your way through massive amount of information and people around you.
709,5.0,In Solution Engineering sometimes there can be a lot of travel / 'last minute' requests but this is balanced by a flexible work environment.
710,5.0,Minimal investment in China hence low growth opportunity
711,4.0,accepte all maneers to be accepted. keep feeling nice and calm.
712,4.0,excessive work hours and work load
713,4.0,"Lack of consistent strategy in APAC Heavy workload, limited support Lack of career progress"
714,2.0,"Unfortunately for a company claiming to have an keen eye on equality and trust, it lets a few things slip through the net: I was called aside following an evening out with colleagues whilst off campus. A department head had reported me after being open about my sexuality in a private conversation. I’m not sure why they felt that was necessary; I wasn’t given any specifics, only that it made them uncomfortable although they didn’t mention this during the conversation! Anyway a few days later I was summoned to HR and I was handed my notice. No warning. No chance to defend myself. It’s a pity because the pay was really good. The internal recruiter who hired me was lovely. The work didn’t seem challenging enough yet however and there was too much process and planning in my opinion. I guess you just have to be careful whom you confide in when you work at a big co. At least my new job allows me to bring my dog to work."
715,4.0,Can be pretty hectic and geared towards sales
716,5.0,The offices are far from the city center
717,5.0,"I had to write few words here else I cant submit the review, so done :)"
718,3.0,The reality of frequent late night+weekend work doesn’t match the promises of work/life balance
719,5.0,Teams and job titles reshuffled often
720,5.0,"The learning program is TrailHead and essentially ""learn by yourself"" methodology which can be tricky because the Sales Playbook is extensive."
721,3.0,"Some disadvantages are coming from the advantages indeed: - It’s really difficult to make good money. Target are increasing and OTE are reflected based on global plans , so it depends a lot on how lucky you are you will be able to reach your targets. - You will have to manage the relationship not just with your direct reporting, but wih different stakeholders who will have different interests. As an example, different AEs from different vertical products interested in selling into the same account, different RVPs to manage with. Alignment is one of the most important words in the company. Some days you will finalise your day thinking about how 90% of your calls were to manage talks with colleagues and not customers/ partners. - Depending on the area you are focus in, territory can be really big or small. This comes with the maturity of the product in the market. Per example , Core products AEs are really focus in small territories, however new products in the Org (Mulesoft, Commerce ,...) counts with small teams yet. These AEs are focus in strategic deals and normally cannot support all the opportunities properly. At the end, quotas are increasing because of new products in the portfolio , but you cannot have the same level of support like in mature ones. So I would say it depends how lucky you are with an specific account your co prime could make a big piece of the quota. - I don’t personally believe you have to be the best sales person in the world to sell in Salesforce. Marketing investment and resources are super huge, some customers buy the vision and what they see in events many times , plus there is plenty of really experienced partners in the region. I would say your results at the end of the year will depend 30% of your work and 70% how lucky you are with your territory , maturity of your account and the work of your co-primes - If you like the start uptype of experience , this is not a place where you will be comfortable for a long time (I must confess smaller regions like Iberia are closer to a start up type of company thought ) However, sometimes you will have the feeling you will spend more time reporting, reading Quips, covering different events, than thinking strategically how to gain relationships, trust and projects. - This company can help you win good money, but reducing your health due to stress and long time at work. Work life balance is challenging. There is not an ending point , you will have to be really good Managing this point to have everyone happy : you (and your health , your closer family (that will have to be open on you travelling and spending long hours at work, and the company) This point is being really important. Some people are leaving , or thinking about doing it, because of this last reason. Retaining employees is key for the company. Many important people use to leave (mostly coming from the acquisitions) because they don’t get use to the way the company operates. A lot of people are ex oracles, this can creates a local culture where not anyone might be confortable with."

736,5.0,"The pace is very fast. There is a lot of travel and sometimes little guidance, Salesforce hires smart people and expects them to dive in the deep end and not only to swim..but to win the race and to coach the rest of the pack while doing it. I wouldn't necessarily classify this as a con personally though - I like the moving fast, and learning and innovating on a daily basis."
737,4.0,"Career progression is not as good as it is suggested. However given that you get brilliant training for each position and a lot of experience it is worth it . Management are very supportive but very much focused on activity, if you are more of a relationship building person and take time closing deals I wouldn't recommend it as it is more high activity driven"

847,3.0,Too many sales reps squeezed into territory to keep up with 30%+ growth targets YOY
848,3.0,Too much speedy. Revenue driven culture so number is everything. when you assign bad territory it's so miserable to survive.
849,4.0,"No room for individuality as company grows more and more ""corporate"" The good old pioneering - innovative years are over."
850,4.0,"Culture can be a popularity contest, especially in pre-sales, you're expected to spend a lot of time going to team events and if you dont participate you wont do as well. You also have to start at 8am everyday"
851,1.0,"Long shifts without breaks due to low staff numbers. Constant bombardment of incidents with a mountain of beaurocratic tasks to wrap up incidents. Promises of higher level experience never materialise. Having to compete with fellow staff to get leave. Management blame staff for refusal to keep up with workload even though refuse to hire more as well refuse to allow use of higher level skills to automate tasks. Management expect staff to be personal secretary and dig up information for their own reports. Management constantly shouting and over all culture of bullying. Management expect training of systems to be an ""extra curricular"" activity on top of long shifts with no breaks. Not allowed so much as a bathroom break without telling someone."
852,5.0,Expect working more than 55h Hard to balance personal and professional life
853,4.0,Salesforce is a very US (San Francisco) centric company. There is limited autonomy to make decisions in the country branches.

855,5.0,Commitment could span to the weekend at times.
856,4.0,"Pressured environment and demanding targets Expectation to ""fit in"" with the company culture which although positive may not suit everyone Having remote bosses means your needs can get ignored"
857,4.0,Not based in the same country than the Account Executives Difficult for alignment
858,5.0,- Creeping bureaucracy with some metrics apparently being collected for the sake of it - Rapid change can make it a challenge to keep up - Career paths outside of the USA are a little opaque
859,5.0,"really fast pace, long or unusual work hours due to high demands on the business"
860,5.0,Relentless pace of sales growth and hiring is not necessarily matched and or paralleled by peripheral and other business units leading to occasional flares but nothing major. Also lack of focus on managing out the people that need to move on to greener pastures. Overall great benefits and nice work hard/play hard mentality. Increasing pressure on target achievement as they hire more and more salespeople reducing their territories whilst maintaining 30% yoy growth
861,4.0,"Regional operation is under control the HQ, so sometimes there is a difficult and unmatched direction to achieve KPI for local employees."

867,5.0,- Too many signs that are leading toward the organisation functioning like Oracle due to product mix. We need to steer clear of this and sell as a team
868,4.0,New Culture change creeping with new managers trying to make their mark Obsessive on individual metrics Intense - sometimes in the wrong way No local autonomy Sales company throughout - impacts other roles Sales or others quick to push people under the bus Political - especially on any interaction with Sales Big company feel now Slowing opportunities

875,1.0,"ORACLE 2.0 -This terminology has been tossed around a lot thorough out these reviews. I view the Oracle effect on Salesforce through the following: 1) Middle Management -This is probably the worst part of Salesforce. These ""managers"" have been placed into these positions as the company grew too quickly. Salesforce will take Account Executives and place them into management positions without previous coaching/mentor experience -As a result, many (not all) of these managers will bastardize AEs. They are very quick to through AEs under the bus to save their image. -These managers have no skills at coaching, helping, or mentoring. -I have personally been involved in one-on-one meetings where I have experienced a manager insulting myself and my work. I have witnessed AEs quit after one-on-one meetings as their manager pushed them beyond limits. -I have also witnessed managers insult clients. If the client ""pushes a deal"" outside of the month it is forecasted, managers will become overly aggressive with the client to pull it back. Sometimes this tactic works, but it upsets the client and destroys future relationships. -Middle management will pick their favourite AEs and provide everything possible to ensure their success. 1.5, 2, 3x territories. Providing the best territories to their favourites. -I left Salesforce as my manager was insulting, rude, aggressive, upsetting to clients, and deceiving. They were not a coach, mentor, or visionary. 2) Territory Management -As stated in the Middle Management section, some AEs will get 1.5, 2, or 3x the territories -Management will tell you that each territory is cut evenly (laughable). So if an individual has 2x territories, they should have enough business to close 2x monthly quota -Even though these lucky AEs have double the territories, your monthly quota is equal to theirs -If these lucky individuals sell 50% of plan in each territory (making up 100%) and you hit 98% of your plan, middle management will act like these individuals are the next Glengarry Glen Ross. Middle Management won't even give you a pat on the back. -It is unfortunate to witness some individuals burn out quickly because they have to work 10x harder in a single territory as others have 2 or 3x territories with the same quota. 3) Transformation of the AE Role -When I first started, AEs were viewed as ""consultants"" with your clients. Your objective was to thoroughly work with your clients to uncover opportunities, manage the projects, and develop thorough business cases. Most importantly, we were to know our clients' business inside and out. -The AE role has now changed into a business development rep. -Middle management will have you call blitz your clients (which they clients get annoyed with), try to identify an opportunity, then pass it to a co-prime (Pardot, Data.com, Service Cloud, Desk). -The AE no longer works throughout the sales cycle. Management seeks to make the AE role into a transactional based environment -This is upsetting to anyone who enjoys relationship selling. -Many clients are becoming annoyed with the various AEs and Co-Primes continually connecting with them. 4) Quick Wins Now vs. Strategic Larger Deals -Management is so focused on monthly quotas that they will push AEs and clients into decisions before the sales cycle is complete -This could negate larger strategic deals as the client gets a ""band-aid"" fix."
876,5.0,"Being such a big company you typically only work on small portion of the bigger picture at a time, but this isn't necessarily a con. It's just the nature of being a large company."
877,4.0,Sometimes combines disadvantages of a start-up with the disadvantages of a huge corporation. Slowly loosing the initial vibe and culture.
878,5.0,Haven't found any yet :)
879,3.0,"- Politics, politics, politics - Product set dated, especially around process management, analytics/decisioning, big data - Oracle clone - Plenty of little emperors in middle management positions with dillusions of grandeur - Average compensation - Overly reliant on inflated Sales Engineering organisation desperately working to shore up glaring gaps/deficiencies in an increasingly fragmented product set"
880,5.0,"- mostly work at the office instead of work from home - territories get shuffled frequently based on fiscal year, promotions, etc. it would be great if there's consistency with the territory, it's challenging to build your region only to be plucked from your patch the next round of territory adjustments - nothing else at this time"
881,4.0,"Compensation could be better, in Dublin it's below industry average"
882,3.0,Culture in the Netherlands. fast growth in people with different backgrounds and culture is hard to create an local culture.

884,4.0,Too fast paced work life balance can be tricky High pressure constantly changing environment
885,4.0,Oracle 2.0 Over inflated characters who spend most of their time preening their egos Vicious political infighting Revolving door management
886,3.0,No team work in the region No coaching in the region Lot of differences between your peers
887,4.0,Business is changing so rapidly all the time- it can be exhausting trying to constantly be agile and cope with a large work load.
888,3.0,"no management, no team spirit, no real strategy on sales patch and target distribution, carreer process for sales is all about network..."
889,4.0,the legacy code is a bit trying
890,1.0,way too much office policy; hiring or promotion is only Partner influence based; Director position have manager responsibilities; Partners are a mixture between manager and Director roles: too much INFLATION of titles
891,5.0,- Long hours - Frequent organizational changes - Frequent headcount freezes
892,4.0,Monthly sales forecasting adopted by the company is not suitable for enterprise sales.
893,4.0,The atmosphere in the office can sometimes be a little negative
894,5.0,If you come from a development background and expecting to further your technical skills - this is not the place for you. You will notice a dip if you don't keep on top of the tech world outside work This is just the nature of the business
895,4.0,Lots of layers of management consisting of managers that could only ever survive in a large corporate structure. Lots of egos although that is to be expected from a sales organisation.
896,5.0,"when growing at 40%, pace is relentless, employees can tire under pressure"
897,2.0,"Politics within the creative team are the worst I've seen anywhere and are getting worse over time. it's purely a leadership problem and the negativity comes from the top where there are a couple mean-spirited individuals who actively seek to undermine leaders from other teams, including people who are new to the company. This has been going on for a couple years and no one has done anything to address it. HR and executive leadership have turned a blind eye! Also, if you need to get anything done with the creative team, you'll be asked to support 1-5 new employees for their team, which costs more and delivers less than hiring an agency to help as needed. It's all about grabbing power there and it's ruining the culture, forcing great talent to leave, and short-changing real growth opportunities. Real growth could also be driven by a better go to market strategy. The go-to-market strategy is weak but made worse by the fact that the campaigns team isn't even led by a marketer or someone who knows how to run campaigns effectively."
898,4.0,One of the sad part was that our concerns which we use to highlight was never use to reach to our higher managers Favor-ism was one of the thing which I witnessed because of which other folks used to slog Job stability is a concern because due to there changes in the higher management they can ask you leave at anytime Also I felt that few people where not competent enough to be a part of the organization not sure how they got hired.
899,5.0,None that I have encountered so far
900,5.0,"High teck, easy to get overlooked"
901,2.0,My role turned out to be very different from what was advertised or discussed during the interview process. Encountered a few other people this had happened to aswell.
902,5.0,Hard work all the time. It is a grind but you can rest your head down on your pillow at night and know you put in a serious effort.
903,5.0,"Strict hierarchical steps upwards (limited responsibility at each level), huge company so not as agile or fast moving as one would hope sometimes, but overall it's definitely a good company to work for"
904,5.0,"Nothing, could stand for better communication between dev and sales"
905,4.0,Lacking on the maturity curve with Largest accounts. Every client is treated the same whether they spend $10k or $10mil. Management is typically not investing in employee skill sets and career growth. Its all about Sales and the weekly numbers.
906,3.0,"This company has serious pipeline issues, if they want to keep growing at 30%. They don't really care how this affects their employees. Quota is unattainable for most except a few ""favourite"" employees."
907,4.0,"Management come from the larger company, but these companies don't grow. They don't have a management experience of growing company."
908,3.0,"Not enough organization, resource and infrastructure to keep up with the growth"
909,5.0,Being in a hub city you sometimes feel slightly less part of the team but overall no cons really...
910,3.0,1 Leadership in India is in a flux 2 High attrition 3 People are not valued
911,2.0,- Lack of management - Lack of leadership - Poor onboarding process - Success only measured and valued by money
912,3.0,"Changing culture with lots of Oracle People coming in in Management Customer focus is number 2 bypassed by ACV Confusing product rebrandings and while marketing is mobile, social ..... a shitty mobile product. Performance Edition must be an Idea from a person who never been at a customer. Unified platform is a Powerpoint Concept. Carreers depends on Buddy business and even people from Middle Management pushes the new market approach while knowing that these concepts failed at Oracle before. Critics are not allowed, we have to believe....and cheer... #awesome"
913,5.0,"Organization split into silos thus prohibiting all division to collaborate around 1 client through it's life cycle. Some colleagues focused on 'plucking the low hanging fruit' and not at getting share of wallet within one enterprise customer. Although my application went very well, I see many candidates wait too long for feedback."
914,1.0,Poor organization from the sales development recruitment specialist team.
915,3.0,Very dashboard-driven. Employees live and die by the metrics
916,4.0,Very large organization.. needs to be more nimble
917,4.0,"Very stringent and regimented in career path, just a cog in a very big machine"
918,4.0,"Almost the same as the ""pros"". Visionary company, CEO lives 5 years in future. Was a disruptive force, but is now normal. Intense culture, not a place for 9-5 behaviour."
919,2.0,"Pay below comparable jobs at other companies High school football captain culture Lack of talent at higher management level (great politicians, often not competent) Work life balance CEO personality cult"
920,3.0,Too much speedy. Revenue driven culture so number is everything. when you assign bad territory it's so miserable to survive.
921,5.0,Very metrics focused. May change directions.
922,5.0,None at the moment. Please hire more guys like me!
923,4.0,"Too much rah-rah, just let others talk about your accomplishments, no need to pat yourself on the back. Now they want non-sales, non-customer facing employees to understand products to communicate to people outside of the company."
924,5.0,A lot of times I felt like the work I was doing wouldn't make it to the final product.
925,5.0,"It is good to have a lot of measures for success, but still need to work on making sure they are accurate, such as adjusting annual team goals when there are open positions for periods of time."
926,5.0,Work politics can impact the job at times. Continuing a start up mentality when the business is growing and needs to be adaptable
927,5.0,"its Pricey. Compared to the comp we are priced high making it more difficult to sell to smaller customers. we have to be more focused on catering to the small companies, not just by value but budget as well"
928,5.0,No Cons experienced so far
929,5.0,Still trying to find it.
930,3.0,"Increasingly over-politicized activism. A significant number of customers, as well as employees of Salesforce, do not share Marc's, and by extension Bay area's, far-left vision of the world. Employees have to keep their mouths shut and opinions to themselves to avoid problems. This year's election put it out in front. Chatter (company's internal ""facebook"") was filled with support for Hillary. Had someone built Trump groups etc., Bay Area folks would have demanded their safe spaces. Personally, I'm not against the Marc's positions and I didn't vote for Trump, but I don't care for the way it impacts employees and some customers. I had a customer this year who refused to go to Dreamforce because of this issue...and that hurts my bottom line."
931,4.0,"Too many sales people, too little accounts Corporate culture becoming too much like Oracle Limited account base due to mass hiring for sales"
932,4.0,Work-life balance is a bit off-the-scale (significant remote work calls for meetings at inopportune times)
933,3.0,"A bunch of Oracle execs were hired over the last 3 years, and they have been busy replicating the Oracle culture here. The worst changes to the company have come in at the beginning of 2015. Quality Engineering was de-prioritized across the R&D organization. Many of the QE execs have been given different roles (I am not complaining about this. To be fair, many of these so-called QE execs should be fired. Do we really need 10 VPs in Quality Engineering? QE heads are now reporting to development managers. The road ahead points to converting all teams to Engineering teams. So if you are a QE trying to get a job, look elsewhere. Do not listen to the drivel from the recruiters. QE ROLE IS ENDING AT SALESFORCE! Added to this, the conflicting priorities are ever increasing in this company. R&D is at its 3rd attempt to re-write the UI, and make it adaptive at the same time. The so-called Salesforce 1 app was a disaster. The next attempt is starting in 2015. Although there is not a lot of hope for it, many of the ""leaders"" driving this will surely make hay via promotions and stock grants."
934,5.0,"Remote employee engagement could get better, but the independence it provides is unparalleled."
935,5.0,"- I think everything is fine. The sub-teams are pretty new, so there are challenges associated."
936,5.0,sometimes having to work long hours. This is not mandatory.
937,4.0,Can be political like any major company. Many senior leaders are primarily focused on the success of their own departments and themselves. Not as cooperative as some companies. Silos aren't necessarily considered a bad thing.
938,5.0,- There really isn't anything negative I can say about working here
939,5.0,Nothing in my opinion just so great !!!!
940,5.0,None To Report Right Now
941,1.0,"Salesforce falls short in how they treat their G&A teams. Succeeding in G&A is not based on skills, qualifications, or ability. As a qualifier, I am not saying this out of spite for being passed over for a promotion or a raise, as I have not even tried for those opportunities yet, this is based on the observations I have of other people in the workforce. First issue, G&A treats those in the main offices much better than they do some of the smaller offices. There truly is a disparate treatment between those in main hubs and those in smaller offices. If you are not located in a main hub, regardless of if the position needs to be at one of the hubs, you have a nearly 0% chance of being given the same opportunities as those in the main hubs. They will not look at what you have accomplished nor will they recognize the value you provide to the company. They will promote from the main hubs or place people in positions that are in the main hubs without even considering other employees across the country. The other key to being given opportunities in the G&A functions is to campaign for the position. Even if you are not the most qualified, if you can make people think you are, Salesforce G&A leadership will not even do interviews to determine who is best for the job. They will wave their little magical wand and poof, the person who has less skills and abilities, but who knew who to align themselves with and convince they are better than everyone else will get moved into positions of authority. If you are a person who does not mind being dishonest, immoral, and you are willing to put down and crush those around you, apply for a G&A function in one of the main Salesforce offices around the country, you will move up quickly and never have to worry about actually knowing your stuff before you are promoted. You may not even need to wait for a position to open up, they may just create a brand new position for you. If you are a great worker who does not like to step all over other people to move up or if you are not in one of the main offices this is not the place for you. They will not even listen to your qualifications skills or abilities when positions open up."
942,5.0,"Always connected means always on - must personally manage to have balance Extremely fast-paced environment feels ""start-up"" like but lack of standardization and process maturity can be counterproductive in a large organization (ironically should drink own Kool-Aid) Too much time spent 'figuring it out'"
943,4.0,Some internal growing pains as a result of extremely fast growth.
944,5.0,"- Everyone works HARD and FAST. People looking to work the system won't last long. Not for everyone. - It's different in every group, but in my group WFH is not really an option, except 1 day a week (which is ""no meeting Thursdays""). - Srini (under Parker Harris) isn't much of an inspiring leader, and I don't agree with all of his decisions. That's about it."
945,5.0,"Not for everyone. The ramp-up process is very rigorous, with required certifications and specific learning tracks. The role may be a struggle for those whose prior SE experience was deep on a technology and focused on features/functions rather than business impact."
946,5.0,None as of yet! I'm just enjoying the ride
947,5.0,"If you are looking to coast this is not the place. They demand passion, energy, and helping all colleagues to achieve a customer focused company. If you the type of person who has said ""that is not my job"" then you will not fit the culture. Everyone at Salesforce is like a big family and you must contribute."
948,4.0,"just a few years ago this was a small to mid-size company, but now it is huge. Too huge for me. Being on the consulting side of a product company is a bad idea once the company gets too large."
949,5.0,Nothing really . . .
950,5.0,"Hard, challenging work (if you don't want to be challenged this could be considered a Con)"
951,5.0,"Stressful, starting to turn into oracle pt2"
952,5.0,Nothing here to comment on at this time
953,5.0,High Tempo Sales Environment Tie to Quota Business Travel
954,5.0,* Pay is low
955,3.0,"I know a lot of ppl who are very happy, but I can only speak about my team and that there are teams at salesforce that are very bad culture and don't value or follow a lot of guidelines that Salesforce has in place. Also overall, Salesforce has a lot of internal politics."
956,5.0,There is literally nothing bad I can say. Salesforce is an amazing place to work.
957,5.0,Can be very San Francisco centric Adherence to corporate values diminishes the closer you get to the top
958,5.0,Challenging for working parents. Some leaders still play favorites and micromanage.
959,5.0,None - don't have any.
960,5.0,None (it is a great place to be )
961,3.0,"I cannot speak for everyone but don't believe the hype. They do have problems and they are brushed under the carpet. They still have ""ism"" issues, I say ""ism"" because if you're a millennial you love this company. When you grow up a little the novelty of ping pong tables and free food wears off. If you don't skip to the SF beat, you're gone and when I say skip to the beat I mean, use you're own initiative."
962,5.0,As the company grows its sometimes harder to navigate the different teams whose efforts may overlap. Priorities are constantly shifting-you need to be agile and not afraid of change.
963,3.0,"Lower than industry-average compensation, poor life-work balance, 30 day sales cycle conflicts customer-centric philosophy which leaves revenue on the table for Salesforce and sometimes matches the wrong products/process to customer needs for fast sale."
964,3.0,"hours, job opportunities, management, constant change"
965,1.0,"Crazy turnover Very few achieve quota (and therefore make very little money) - I'm well over my #, but am the exception Sales management micro management and expectations Very little product enablement for customers, support is struggling, revolving door with accounts means everyone has a short term focus (sell it all now, let someone else deal w/ the aftermath)"
966,5.0,Not much to be unhappy about.
967,4.0,"It is a company for being young and single. Its more of a struggle when you have other responsibilities (family). Lots of social events, happy hours and offsite meetings. I've experienced that volunteering isn't ""encouraged"" unless it's WITH the group (no personal causes) and if you want to support a personal cause, it had better be on the weekend (when you want to spend time with family) rather than during working hours. Cornhole must be played at every event. And people pour themselves into the job, 24/7. No turning off or tuning out - no matter what is ""touted"" from corporate. Although ""balance"" is said to be priority, it must be fought for, and only after you've earned tenure. Work hard for 5 years, then you can have some balance (maybe.)"
968,5.0,Miss out on a good chunk of culture/events by working in satellite office (although you can always participate online).
969,5.0,Work hard play hard. Hours can be long and demands can be tough. Company continues to grow rapidly and is becoming more corporate.
970,4.0,None that I have seen in my almost 2 years here.
971,5.0,Company has grown fast and they have not quite figured out how to enable and ensure the culture expands to remote EE's through leadership/
972,4.0,Very hard to hit Quota regardless of the salesperson
973,2.0,"Extremely short staffed, meaning workload is immense and the metrics pressure is insanely stupid putting undeserved pressure on employees. Upper management is completely clueless about anything that doesn't appear on their dashboard."
974,5.0,- Speed to deliver can be improved
975,4.0,- Outdated and antique waterfall process for infrastructure planning and service that hinders innovation - Synergy is lacking across different clouds within Salesforce. Internal duplication and contentions between different cloud is inevitable - Heavy interdependencies between groups and departments makes it hard to make any meaningful progress in an agile way
976,5.0,hard grind and a lot of pressure
977,4.0,"Not all product arms within Salesforce are organized equally. The Marketing Cloud arm is sequestered from the core teams, so there isn't nearly as much transparency or growth as compared to the core organization."
978,4.0,Can be political like any major company. Many senior leaders are primarily focused on the success of their own departments and themselves. Not as cooperative as some companies. Silos aren't necessarily considered a bad thing.
979,5.0,stagnant compensation small raises and promotions
980,4.0,"Cost cutting measures taking effect due to growth Quotas increased mid-year for account execs based on deal sizes closed Commission rates reduced as quotas increase Caps on AES earnings Tough to earn money year over year - feast one, starve two mentality"
981,4.0,red tape. getting too big. the processes are heavy such that a lot of the sales reps feel numbed by the heavy processes. big acquisitions feeling like the next oracle
982,5.0,None I can think of
983,4.0,"Different ""clouds"" have different code bases and cultures, and some of them aren't as interested in modern development methodology, or even being able to do basic code analysis."
984,5.0,"Takes a while to find your footing. Certification process may be intimidating for some, takes a while to onboard."
985,4.0,"- Majority don't truly care - Too much emphasis on process that it becomes an overhead for those who want to get the job done - No sense of loyalty or mechanism in place for career development, you are on your own - A lot of it is show business - very poor management"
986,5.0,"Title inflation Unstructured career path Sales-driven culture Managers promoted for individual contribution, not leadership abilities"

988,3.0,"Politics, politics, politics, politics, politics"
989,5.0,nothing that I can think of
990,5.0,"Work can be a bit dry, hard to network due to many employees"
991,4.0,"Limited growth opportunities and a lot of churn projects you might not find satisfaction in. Less strategy, more art and logistics (due to heavy event and presentation focus). Highly matrixed causing sometimes needless delays and pivots."
992,5.0,It moves fast and there's a lot to learn...but if you enjoy learning this isn't a con.
993,5.0,there is a considerable amount of pressure on the monthly sales cadence even though you have a annual quota.
994,5.0,A lot of learn and it is a very fast moving and changing company - not a con per se - but challenging to keep up.
995,5.0,"Having been around, none of the challenges at Salesforce seem insurmountable."
996,5.0,"High performance, high intensity organization requires a full commitment of time and energy"
997,2.0,"Unless you are single and have a lot of free time, I recommend you look elsewhere for jobs. -Team got so large in 2016, what used to be a friendly culture becomes more of less corporate like. -Ex-CEO left, the whole RelateIQ CRM product is getting killed out at some points. -Constantly pivot with fears one day the product is not competitive. -The motto is people, idea, moment and RESULT, yes, result is the only they care regardless of how we achieve it. -Some of the management here are very junior and got converted from early day RelateIQ engineers. With a mindset of moving fast and ridiculously unorganized, this put a whole lot of work on engineers. A lot of LEGACY code that got produced without being thoughtfully planned out. This leads to a lot of hard to trace bugs. -A lot of PM here are super junior who have no clue what's the product development is. This leads to product decision delay, etc. Product planning is totally a joke here. No Scrum of any sort, the process puts a lot of weight on engineer to figure out the problems and solutions. The only thing the PM really does here is to send out email releases when something is about to release. -Lots of young engineers who only care about deliver cool features fast which sacrifices the quality. If you happen to work on a feature last, you are the single point of contact and have to maintain the whole load of it. -Watch out for all the good perks, at some points, when SalesforceIQ is fully melted into Salesforce family, these perks will also go away. Take a look at the Fraiche account, the Lyft credit, the housing stipend, they are all gone. -Don't let the offer congratz email blast from the recruiting and engineering team cloud your judgement. All the things about the family like culture and what's not, this culture is no longer respected. -Some middle managers are control freaks who like to micro manage every of you move. -Every Friday demo is just a hacky thing that squeezes out your extra work and you feel obligated to demo something to the company. -The quarterly Hackday mentality is just another way you work extra hard and late night to produce something really cool."

The user experience team is made up of software engineers that dictate design decisions and do not encourage healthy debate or review of user desires. Extremely top-down.

1041,4.0,disorganized; changing priorities; ad hoc
1042,4.0,"Why is drinking such a big part of the company culture? It saddens me that even a below-21 intern feels he/she can't participate fully in the ""culture"" because drinking is such a ""big part"" of it, as seen in a recent Glassdoor review. I don't drink for health reasons, and I often feel like work events (holiday parties, team celebrations, Dreamforce) are less rewarding for me because the non-alcoholic choices are an afterthought. Can I have a $20 gift card instead?! I've seen a lot of employees misbehaving and embarrass themselves through alcohol. Time to cut back. Alcohol is not the same thing as a company culture. Second, I have no illusions that working remotely is a perfect situation. I know I miss out on a lot in the office and I am ok with it. That said, I think the company could do more to make Salesforce better for non-SF members of the Ohana. I also think there should be better career paths for those who are not managers. Because I'm remote, I have been told I don't have much room to move up since I can't manage remotely (even though my manager manages me remotely... and that seems to work fine). The company expects so much of us during Dreamforce (12+ hour days for a week), but we never see any time off as a result of that."
1043,5.0,"No real cons to share, only thing I would say is that it is a very typical industry job (a ""boring"" 9-5)."

1060,4.0,Other Salesforce hubs don't seem to be cut from the same cloth when it comes to the different parts of sales. Indy is also the main Marketing Cloud hub so we have to work with the other sales teams within Salesforce who sell the other products that we offer. Some would rather get their money than do what is best for the customer. It's difficult to work across the different hubs sometimes because of this.
1061,4.0,"Bloated Management, Hard to get ahead"
1062,5.0,"Like at any enterprise tech company, the work is big and complex. With responsibility over projects that affect hundreds to thousands of people, balancing work priorities and personal life can feel a bit rocky at times. Fortunately, there is always a bright mind to turn to for help and no shortage of motivated, hard-working people around you to get the job done and have a little fun while doing it."
1063,5.0,Bureaucracy - Internal framework sucks - top down approach in engineering -
1064,2.0,"The culture has significantly changed. A year ago I was proud and excited to be a part of the company. The Lightning release was a shining moment for how the company's culture can facilitate great things. However, there have been a number of changes over the last year that have slowly eroded the magic - starting with some of the new leadership. Our group has become more fragmented and less collaborative. There's more fear of making mistakes and the general sense of trust and support for our work from our leadership has gone way down. The transparency and access we had upwards is becoming more hazy largely because of layers being added. My autonomy and empowerment to make decisions is slipping away. Politics were always there, but now they're something you have to consider daily. You used to be judged based on the work you created and what you shipped, it doesn't feel that way anymore. Some of my favorite people have already moved on. Perhaps it's just the nature of a company growing this fast. There's not a clear avenue for safely giving upwards feedback for our group. My hope is that someone up top takes notice and makes corrections."
1065,3.0,"Unrealistic quota goals. Every single month feels like it's end of quarter, and end of quarters feel like end of year. End of year is just insane. The pressure every single month is tough to deal with and especially in ESMB, quotas are just not realistic. Big deals tough to come by. You'd expect a sales role at Salesforce to have plenty of inbound leads or plenty of add on business for existing customers - really not the case. Ton of outbound, cold calling, hunting role (but in your limited account base of course). Be ready to have literally everything questioned and expected to tell your manager absolutely everything going on in any deal at all times. You'll be questioned on everything you do. The culture in the NYC office is nothing like the other offices. When there are events or happy hours, everyone is too busy or exhausted to even go. Very much a heads down and focus kind of atmosphere. Path to promotion is VERY political. Be prepared to play the game to move up."
1066,3.0,"Very strong politics and somewhat negative orientation in the market for their customers. Rely on big services and other upsells. Widely varying levels of success depending on the integration partner. NOT focused on new features and innovation, but milking the existing stack for maximum revenue."
1067,3.0,"Political environment Lots of middle management Big enough company for weak performers to find a place to hide, undetected Hiring freezes Over titled and over leveled culture (perhaps for retention)"
1068,5.0,"Company is growing so there are some growing pains Has 401k, but no retirement plan, which is normal for these days No free lunch, can't think of another Cons"
1069,4.0,"Employees overworked, bad departmental management"
1070,4.0,It has become a very large and successful company so if you are looking for a startup or small company experience this will not be a fit.
1071,3.0,politics are heavy and you'll find yourself in the sour end of the stick real quick if you don't play along. Ideas aren't welcome if you don't have seniority Red tape to get approvals for anything is strong Bad internal communication

1081,5.0,Growing pains from size on internal processes. Hard to say a con as the team is highly active in streamlining.
1082,5.0,roles are sliced too thin. business still tilted towards the core sfa and service cloud business.
1083,5.0,Really can't think of any cons.
1084,2.0,The worst work life balance than any company I have worked for. They only care about growing revenue at any cost and the most short term focussed company. Employees have to turn around everything within 24 hours irrespective of personal priorities. Expected to work weekends with no compensation for long hours out in The Sales culture is a mess with large attrition as nobody wants to stay longer with such short term focus
1085,5.0,None that I can think of.
1086,4.0,"-Can be a struggle depending on the group you support, you are either really busy or its super slow."
1087,5.0,"It is really hard to think of any negative experiences I have had at SalesforceIQ. Maybe the only thing is as new employees (as they grow in numbers), invest more with meeting people across the company."
1088,1.0,It's gotten way too big and Salesforce puffs out it's big chest and considers it a privilege if companies become clients. Way too much boasting You're a cog in a wheel and will report to several different people there. New territories are given out without any input from AEs. You're successful if you have a good territory and it depends if Salesforce has pissed off that company in the past. If so - good luck!
1089,2.0,"diversity? what diversity? White men and white people everywhere once the rose colored glasses come off, one has to decide whether I'll stay or I'll go"
1090,3.0,"- The Salesforce acquisition changed a lot of things about the culture, positions, teams, and leadership of SteelBrick for the worse (as expected with any acquisition, but still tough to manage). - The acquisition happened so fast (announcement to close ~1 month), that it barely gave employees time to process. The business had to be wrapped up and packaged for SFDC so quickly that employees were basically handed their offer letters and told 'sign now and we'll figure out logistics about how your position will change later'. -The lack of communication during the acquisition, on boarding, and transition process created a divide between leadership and employees, causing distrust in leadership. Employees were commonly given answers about the future of their positions with 'we're not sure yet, we're working on it, and we'll let you know when we figure things out'. - SteelBrick leadership focused primarily on their money-making teams (sales and dev) as their priority to ensure a smooth transition. The other teams we're offered positions with Salesforce, but haven't been given the opportunity to get the same improvements. The leadership team is only willing to fight for the teams that make more money for them. - The further we get into Salesforce, the more we've lost our personal identity and culture. There's not as many fun events or opportunities for employees to come together and enjoy some time off. Everyone's too overworked and underpaid to want to stay around the office longer then they have to."
1091,5.0,"It's probably impossible to keep up with everything going on, and although it's possible, it's hard to figure out how to keep up with what you want to, like your areas of interest and work. But there is the opportunity to through communication, videos, meetings, etc, to keep up with whatever you want."
1092,4.0,"This is a sales company, not a tech company. No one is working on cutting edge research or sinking resources into developing novel systems. You are building CRM software."

1094,2.0,"Management glaringly incomplete / arrogant! the wave analytics product should of never been released...at least another 18 months of basic development needed... Couldn't do basic analytics functions, nowhere on the Gartner Magic quadrant, and dropped price so much that reps can't make any money unless it's an added line item on a large non Wave deal"
1095,5.0,"Growing very fast, some industry focus seems unorganized and not led or driven by the best industry experts, employee development can be improved"
1096,2.0,Revolving door of reps. Account list is sparse. Pressure for revenue is monthly and not quarterly. average AE lifespan is 12mos or less. Management pressures internal recruiting to hire as they will never be at capacity in reps due to the constant turnover.
1097,3.0,"You don't get free lunch or dinner, unlike many other companies in proximity. Google, Facebook, Twitter, Uber are just a few to name."
1098,3.0,sales territories are getting small
1099,5.0,The company is growing very quickly and that creates some challenges - but those challenges also provide opportunities for growth.
1100,5.0,"It's a larger company so work tends to move more slowly. However, your actual team is usually small."
1101,5.0,Still a massively growing company so there's some reorganization going on that complicates learning the minor details about Salesforce and the technologies it uses.
1102,4.0,"Before the Salesforce acquisition, SteelBrick was growing at an explosive pace. Since the acquisition, explosive growth is an understatement. With that said, everybody is running at breakneck speed and I think that (as a team) we're a bit worn down. If you join SteelBrick, be prepared to be pulled in a million directions all at once. Work / life balance is out of sorts. Right now (8/22/16), the CORE Salesforce team doesn't have much education on Q2C or understanding of product fit. This means we're talking with a lot of customers that are poor fit or having to field angry calls about why we ""killed"" a poorly qualified opportunity. I don't foresee this problem going away any time soon since Q2C is the most complex product offering in Salesforce's portfolio. There are a limited amount of SteelBrick-certified partners (~50), but customers insist on working with partners that have no experience implementing Q2C applications. This means that their implementations are taking longer than they should. There's nothing we can do about this since it's ultimately the customer's choice, but it puts unnecessary burden on our team. Customers come back during their implementation asking for support, but what they really want is implementation guidance. There is a lot of process change happening right now. For current employees, it's been pretty frustrating. I don't know if this has any barring on new hires, but it does make it difficult to get straight answers since we're all new to these processes as well."
1103,4.0,Will have to try very hard to gain visibility . You may easily get very distracted in other activities apart from work. The charm of the city is also very distracting sometimes.
1104,5.0,"Trying to transition to a different role from executive assistant is pretty impossible unless you know the right people. The process for internal candidates is less than desireable and the recruiters that manage EA's are not effective. They scoff at the idea of an EA moving into another role, unless of course you have a connect to move you out of the EA world."
1105,5.0,There really aren't any downsides. All of my expectations leading up to the internship were exceeded.
1106,5.0,This isn't really a negative but be prepared to work hard and learn a lot. You are surrounded by some of the top students across the nation along with some of the smartest managers. It's a competitive company to get into. If you expect the best of yourself then you're in the right place.
1107,5.0,Sometimes may feel chaotic and distracted.
1108,3.0,"The people think they are amazing, they are average. Its got the normal big company politics, and is more of a marketing machine than owners of any revolutionary tech. Externally thought of as leaders in tech, but really internally very behind the times on cloud based computing. Quite a large monolithic stack, that has not evolved in a long time. Any innovation here is bought in acquisitions, which are very poorly integrated into the whole."
1109,5.0,Challenging to balance work and life
1110,2.0,Growing the army was such a concern they often hired the wrong types for management. I loved my peers but managers seemed under qualified.

1112,5.0,"- The only constant is change, you have to stay nimble."
1113,3.0,Super political. Culture used to be high in accountability and collaboration. Now it is very competitive and dysfunctional. Leaders spend a lot of their time trying to take down their peers.
1114,5.0,Work life balance can sometimes be a challenge.

1122,5.0,Can't think of any cons really - even with the growth of the company the culture has been very well maintained in my opinion.
1123,2.0,"Unrealistic Sales culture polluted by ex Oracle people, poor alliance model and poor internal prof services organization hurts implementation experience of customers"
1124,4.0,Work is not very strategic
1125,2.0,"Interestingly, what most excited me about Salesforce is what I found most lacking. I found the environment very sexist, male-dominated, negative, and non-inclusive. There is virtually no trust and I feel completely accurate in stating there is no work-life balance. You are collateral damage in the way to achieving a monthly quota. I left a paranoid, shattered professional with emotional scars I would equate to abuse. I'm sure not all experiences are the same as mine. I was unfortunate to land where I did within the organization. I know there are many folks who flourish there."
1126,2.0,"- If you come from an acquisition, Salesforce isn’t going to pay you as well as they pay their internal employees. Even if you are doing the same exact job as someone inside Salesforce, you will probably be making significantly less than what a core employee will be making. It was extremely frustrating and completely demeaning to hear all the hype and news about how Salesforce employees are so happy with their compensation and how Salesforce is making strides towards equal pay. Apparently, acquired company employees are not part of that equation and we do not hold as much value and shouldn’t be treated as equals…ridiculous. I asked for a compensation change in order to match or even come close to the pay of my peers within the Salesforce organization but was told that Salesforce does not have enough internal data to justify a compensation change. Essentially, there was no proof at Salesforce that I was worth a compensation change. This blew my mind because when you first hire someone, you have no proof internally that they are worth the salary that you are going to pay them. What you do instead is evaluate their past experiences and then you determine what is fair pay based on their experiences, skills, and the job that they are doing. You have no internal data or proof in that situation. If you acquire a company, yes, you have no Salesforce data to prove that an employee is worth a certain salary but you acquired a product that you clearly thought had value and the people who helped to create that product are not worth a compensation change because you don't have enough data? I had been working for the acquired company for almost a year, but all of that was meaningless because if you're acquired, it seems like you're not truly a ""Salesforce employee"" and being paid fairly is not something that applies to you. - Our entire acquisition process was a complete mess. My team and I essentially had to operate “as normal” which was completely impossible given that all of our management and the rest of the company were trying to figure out the acquisition themselves. We were lost in the transition, did not have managers for quite some time, and were essentially left to fend for ourselves for the better part of 4 months. It didn’t seem like the M&A team knew what to do with us and had forgotten we existed. - During the acquisition process, we were told that there would be tons of opportunities within the Salesforce organization but once we were in the Salesforce organization, in reality, there were no opportunities. We contacted departments and teams we were interested in and were repeatedly told that they were not hiring or that you needed XYZ experiences that none of us had. We had no choice in what department or role we were assigned. A role was thrown on us, whether we liked it or not, with no other presented opportunities. - My team and I were expected to hit ridiculous numbers as soon as we were acquired despite the fact that we were not fully integrated, did not receive the goal numbers until halfway through a quarter, and still had to facilitate the entire merging of all our systems with Salesforce's systems. We received very little support from the core Salesforce organization and were treated as if we were incompetent because we could not hit these numbers. It seemed like my team and I were being set up for failure so that the core team had a reason to get rid of us once we did not hit a specific goal."

1132,5.0,"Really hate working in San Francisco. It's cold all the time (don't expect a summer here), lots of homeless people all over, super-expensive to live in the city or long commute from elsewhere. Walking to the shuttle and waiting for the shuttle is painful, particularly when it's cold or rainy which is a lot. Downtown traffic is horrible and parking costs $50/day which is unaffordable."
1133,4.0,"no life - between the work load and company events, say goodbye to your personal life."
1134,4.0,Can be more focused on sizzle/marketing than on results. Important to be well-connected & have senior exec patronage for success.
1135,4.0,"The growth has made Pardot lose that tight culture it once had. Previously, everyone would say ""hi"" to everyone and make a chance to learn everyone's names. Now, there's a ridiculous amount of people and cliques have formed. You can't really fault the company for this, that's on the employees. From an engineering perspective, Pardot is inherently stuck on this giant monolithic legacy code base. When you hire 5 new engineers each week, there are the same exact questions because no one can even google the answer given how old the majority of the tech stack is. There have been efforts to split this out into micro services but decisions are often made by engineering managers and tech leads who have been dispositioned into enterprise related solutions that are often dated for the modern web and just not fun to work with. You can't blame them too much for this, product managers are breathing down their necks constantly. More often than not, these early decisions aren't well thought out and lead to projects getting scrapped 6 months later or resulting in a significant re-design. Annoyingly too that is that Pardot has a concept of ""hack days"" to work on whatever you want. This used to be an engineering fun event and solutions that made a better coding experience would often win. Since the T&P (Technology and Product) lingo started evolving, the only thing that wins is something that can sell something."

Unfair distribution of work - lots of people seemingly only have 1 or 2 things to do which warrants them sending multiple emails asking if you got their first two emails after a few hours. Sandbagging budgets - budget owners will make up headcount needs and cook the books to hold onto money and use it for self serving purposes rather than the good of business"
1141,5.0,All IT is centralized in SFO region. If you want career growth then you have to move to SF region.
1142,3.0,Some unrealistic expectations for the sales teams. Smaller cities do not get the respect that the larger cities get in regards to resources.
1143,5.0,"sometimes difficult to communicate with people from other locations on your team (HQ, Japan, Europe, etc.) but this is to be expected in any large corporation."
1144,5.0,The tools can be clunky.
1145,2.0,"Depending on who your hiring manager is and how he likes you determines your success or failure. I have seen a lot of unfair treatment, people pushed out the org and a lot of people coming getting hired and promoted that made little to no sense. If you are not the person that likes to play up popularity and politics and just focus on YOUR JOB.... This place isn't for you. Also, if you are customer focused some of the protocol within the organization makes it extremely difficult to build a long term relationship and do what is right for the customer. Customers are spending more money and contracts are growing to the point they can not afford them. There's little you can do to help customers you have relationships with in a bind which frustrates lots of customers. Spend more time in sales doing customer service than selling."
1146,3.0,"""Mean Girls"" environment. Super competitive for titles and promotions."
1147,5.0,"- Constant growth requires patience and acceptance of occasional ambiguity, can be challenging for those who are used to traditional corporate environment"
1148,4.0,Lack of work/life balance in the sales organization
1149,5.0,Still looking for real cons. It could be easy to get overwhelmed by all the technology and communication. There are lots of volunteering opportunities and making time to participate requires good time management
1150,1.0,"-Terrible customer service-- Unless client pays for premium customer service, we can't help them (and even then we have to pass them onto a rep in another country); -Huge company with an even bigger ego. If you worked anywhere else, it's nothing compared to SF. You're lucky to work there and they don't value any of the reps opinions. If you were a senior level salesperson elsewhere, prepare to take at least two steps back. -Quota is unrealistic and management knows it. The best reps hit quota once a quarter typically. -Overworked: scolded if you don't answer calls and emails on weekends. -Benefits aren't always what they seem. Try to take full amount of paternity leave and you'll be told by management that, ""No one really takes that long for paternity leave. You can come back in a few days or else your job won't be here."" -Never able to take days off at end of months or the entire last month of a quarter."
1151,4.0,Monthly pressure in Sales is hardcore. We burn relationships with our best customers to get a small deal in the month. Need to stay focused on the customer and what is best for the customer. Too focused on our month and deal. This is highly dependent on the Manager for your team. Some are more balanced.
1152,5.0,"Many people work remotely or travel a lot, so office can be lonely but that varies by day."
1153,4.0,"Technical infrastructure, technical challenges, less accountability"
1154,5.0,The drive to continue making new features was a higher priority than dealing with existing issues. Sometimes important issues were backlogged in favor of new feature work.
1155,4.0,It's all depends on your manager. Company has no such hard stop rules.
1156,5.0,Transition period to salesforce was a little rocky.
1157,4.0,Pressure to perform Stress Competitive Environment Big Company - Not startup Hard to change processes
1158,5.0,"- Questionably bro-ey, but this could be true of Sales org in particular"
1159,5.0,Too large to feel as though you are making a difference in the company
1160,5.0,Very fast passed and high quota expectiaiotns
1161,5.0,"HQ centric company, lots of travel to SF"
1162,5.0,If a remote employee sometimes you can feel isolated..
1163,5.0,You wont get exactly the start up culture some smaller companies have and as company grows so does the bureaucracy. The dynamic nature of the product makes it hard to focus on innovation rather than legacy and integration.
1164,4.0,"While relatively challenging, the work can be extremely repetitious and dull Lack of consistent knowledge share Actual work space was cramped - contractors shared small room with around 15 other contract developers from various teams"
1165,5.0,Not very many. Some challenges to handle delivery st scale.
1166,5.0,"There's a learning curve to trying to not become too corporate, but at the same time 19,000+ employees globally. Occasionally I feel that we are very top heavy management wise."
1167,5.0,So far it has been great work place. No Cons.
1168,5.0,"Need to like a fast pace of work, constant change, high level of travel, the company is continuing to mature, but there the growing pains can be tough"
1169,5.0,"At fist your might feel overloaded with the new information but don't get shocked, Take your time and do your best"
1170,4.0,"While SF tries to maintain the Ohana culture, the reality is it's still a very large company. Hard to not feel like a ""number"". Also, while they provide a large amount of PTO (even unlimited for management), it's next to impossible to take even a day completely off. People are working constantly."
1171,3.0,sometimes it is not competative
1172,5.0,Not a data driven organization
1173,5.0,"Very quickly growing, still learning how to be an enterprise business in some aspects"
1174,2.0,"1. Too much politics! You will spend more time dodging criticisms and blames, rather than doing actual work. 2. Unless you can speak ""Tamil"" or ""Telugu"", or are awesome at work politics, you shouldn't join this company's IT department. Hard work is not rewarded. 3. Absolutely not worth being here if you are a contractor, unless you don't mind being treated like a slave."
1175,5.0,Not a lot of time to decide.
1176,3.0,"Salesforce is a very demanding place to work and 12 - 15 hour workdays are the norm across many departments. While the company talks about the importance of wellness and encourages employees to take care of themselves, they have yet to modify the actual workload and expectations that would allow employees to do that."
1177,3.0,Too many new sales reps to support growth targets. Can be somewhat of a “feast or famine” scenario.
1178,4.0,"Lack of process, planning is poor in some areas. Some people in management believe that we are still a startup, which can be limiting. Staffing is lean and staff are very, very busy!"
1179,4.0,Company only understands direct sales and has not embraced and invested in indirect sales channels. Senior management of indirect sales has no experience or background. Consistently under invest and make short sighted decisions.
1180,5.0,Lack of Inter-team communication and transparency
1181,5.0,"HQ focus. Remote employee do not have as good perk as HQ.,"
1182,5.0,- Start up like culture with shifting priorities - Frequent product acquisitions
1183,5.0,Can't think of any worth noting.
1184,5.0,Multiple Hub offices but everything seems to happen at HQ
1185,5.0,Senior levels involve a lot of politics.
1186,5.0,I haven't found a con yet.
1187,4.0,"Going through a big of a growth spurt and feeling growing pains along the way. If you're not in SF office, it can feel like you don't exist at times."
1188,5.0,"Onboarding is decent but you are on your own after that, sales process is lengthy and most are paid on an annual number but there is this intense monthly cadence number."
1189,3.0,"Has a lot more attitude, ego and greed than the outward facing benevolent front it publicly conveys. It's a hard driving, results oriented place that doesn't always put employees first. And it's gotten big, so be very careful about where you land and vet the people carefully; some are great, some are not."
1190,5.0,Many benefits are only available where Salesforce has an official office
1191,4.0,Things can be more political than they initially seemed. Opportunity to make an upward move are not clearly communicated. My group is not as flexible as most of the company/policies.
1192,5.0,"lots of work, busy, commute, expensive to live in city, need more benefits"
1193,3.0,"- FinSrv vertical is struggling. Big bang accounts are rare and easy lay up accounts are given to Oracle friends, boys click. - FinSrv Accounts pie is cut too many ways - Pay out is every 2+ years if that - Worst is the new Oracle culture. Mgmt is all about badging and silly stickers and certifications you need to get to be able to tell the customer story when they should be helping with relationships & focusing on the problems at hand - global AEs are just in title, they don't actually get paid on global revenue - so watch out for that when you review your comp. - Comp % is low from market but can be better if you are Oracle friends - Mgmt bullies into inflating pipeline and force commit deals every quarter"
1194,1.0,"I wouldn't tell even my worst enemy to go to work for Salesforce after the experience I have had. It's a huge company that cares very little for lower-level employees. Don't expect to transfer departments or move to a better job no matter how hard you work. You will be subject to the whims of upper management.. The company has also recently changed its volunteer time off policy to turn it into a weird sort of competition, so there's no longer a guarantee that you will receive a grant to donate to the charity of your choice if you complete your volunteer hours for the year. Everything about this company is horrible and the direction it is headed is wrong in so many ways."
1195,5.0,"Not always easy to have a work life balance, although they encourage you to. Your internal social network is key to succeeding and moving up (this is a pro for some). If you can't cut it, they will cut you."
1196,5.0,None that I can think of
1197,5.0,None that I can think of. One aspect that might consider con: - Salesforce is place for passionate employees. It doesn't to make you work overtime but you need to be passionate about what you do. It is not the place for those who like to do work are needed chore.
1198,1.0,"The constant change leads to disorganized teams, lack of trust and a unproductive environment. Teams seem hellbent on destroying other teams. Acquisitions are poorly managed."
1199,5.0,Company is growing fast and as a result there's a growing bureaucracy that's makes it difficult to get things done quickly and efficiently.
1200,4.0,"Technical debt is building up, and scaling has become difficult since the business is doing so well. Communication between departments is rough sometimes."
1201,5.0,There is a strong learning curb for those of you who do not come from technical backgrounds
1202,2.0,Sales Management is driven to grow at all costs. Culture of the firm is very positive and philanthropic messages are very positive however the maniacal need to grow 50% y/y puts customer success in second position over deal completion. The growth messages are coupled with sales culture that is not long term relationship (Trusted Advisor) messaging that the overall company convey's to the market.
1203,5.0,"There are opportunities for improvement, which is not different from other companies. The difference with Salesforce compared to my former employer is that there is opportunity to make a big impact at Salesforce, which opens the door for doing business better and reduces the red tape."
1204,5.0,i do not have anything to say
1205,5.0,"The team is growing fast, and who knows what will happen to the culture with such a massive growth. The founders are dedicated to keeping the culture, but somethings are simply out of ones control."
1206,2.0,Too many sales reps and very small territories / selling opportunities. Lots of sales turnover.
1207,5.0,"Be more competitive with perks, e.g. free meals or more shuttles Non-HQ offices receive less love Some promotions seem to be a popularity contest"
1208,5.0,"The work can be slow and dull at times. Occasionally there are fun scaling problems, but that's not the norm."
1209,5.0,"With 20k employees sometimes things get lost in the shuffle. My only con is, because we are growing so fast, its become almost impossible to keep the balance with the growth. So the ""go getter's"" like myself, and the ""self helpers"" do better than those that need a little hand holding. Come in, move fast, and it never slows down. This isn't a con for me, but for some it could pose an uncomfortable challenge."
1210,4.0,"growing large very quickly, no meals provided"
1211,5.0,have to be ready to work in a large corporation with many different players
1212,5.0,"office politics, changes in the workplace may be excessive"
1213,2.0,"Ultra micromanaged, terrible office morale, revolving door sales team. Leadership is out of touch and fills the day with ridiculous reporting and busy work. Consistent missing payments in your paycheck. You'll have to chase down every deal. Zero work / life balance."
1214,5.0,nothing you wouldn't find anywhere else
1215,4.0,- Some politics - A little slow since the company size is large - Changes in products
1216,5.0,"Working in a large company always has its challenges, but overall I have no major complaints."
1217,5.0,No Free Lunch for Engineer
1218,1.0,"the management stinks, lot's of 1-2 year managers that offer no value. It's all about metrics and pipeline generation, less that 20% will achieve their number, it's all about luck and nepotism. If you've made money in your career and want to continue making money, keep looking, most sales reps leave in >2 years. I hated working for Salesforce, too many ego's and you will spend way to much time on selling internally and appeasing others."
1219,5.0,Cant think of any cons of Salesforce
1220,5.0,"There is a lot of movement, people do not stay in roles for a very long time"
1221,1.0,Worst life / work balance situation imaginable - and Sr Management does not care Only one raise in last 4 years Everyone is afraid to tell management the truth - Sr Management is extremely vindictive HR Dept offers no help to current employees People in the field are second class citizens to people at HQ
1222,5.0,territories move often stay in positions for a long period of time
1223,5.0,"No Free Lunch, Benefits are trimming as company is growing."
1224,3.0,"Backstabbing, unnecessarily agressive culture; horribly inept middle management. Rapid hiring without adequate training have left many people working on unnecessary and unproductive projects"
1225,4.0,"Fast growth means fast paced work environment. This keeps the job very exciting but also challenges in terms of changing priorities, ""fire drills"" and decisions being made without putting a lot of thought into future impact."
1226,5.0,Long work weeks and some travel required.
1227,5.0,"cut throat and if you don't like sales, get out"
1228,5.0,Work life balance is tough to achieve at times. Unrealistic expectations on the market in regard to salaries
1229,5.0,"overly competitive, but still a great thing. Potential hostile coworkers, but minor"
1230,3.0,Hiring and promotion decisions are at times perplexing. Senior leadership seems disconnected from the masses. The organization is getting big - HR needs to be more involved and influence more.
1231,5.0,Not a data driven organization
1232,5.0,"-long turnaround for promotions, at times can be out of your control"
1233,1.0,"The workforce is not very diverse and the environment is all about doing what it takes to launch product without any thought to employee burn out. No work/life balance & their work from home policy is also misleading. Layers and layers of politics beyond anything you will ever experience (& I've worked for some large corporations but nothing like SFDC)! More often then not, people get promoted based on popularity & not on merit. Internal opportunities are few as they would rather backfill from outside rather than consider developing an internal candidate. I'm surprised at the number of people that say this company cares about their people as all the depts I've worked with including my own often referred to having a ""thankless job"" and the sentiment seemed consistent everywhere I went - the only exceptions are the employees that are fairly new to the company. I am a firm believer in giving back which is why volunteerism was an important criteria for me when seeking out employees. I was so disappointed to discover that my management saw volunteer hours as a game - ""log your hours and volunteer so we can beat the other dept....I will be checking hours by the end of the week"" This is disturbing!"
1234,5.0,Very fast passed and high quota expectiaiotns
1235,5.0,"Getting up to speed takes time. Internally teams operate very differently and everyone has their own process to intake work which makes for a frustrating experience trying to interact with other teams. I will say with a company with such great overall culture, internally there is definitely a lack of willingness to help other teams. This may be from the large percentage of A+ players driving their own initiatives?"
1236,5.0,If there are any downsides to Salesforce I haven't seen them.
1237,5.0,"a bit of an overwhelming pace, but well worth it!"
1238,5.0,"Not a con, but they move very fast. May not be the best fit if you don't like change. It happens quickly here."
1239,5.0,None - This company really is amazing!
1240,5.0,All companies have growing pains.
1241,5.0,"Still finding my way around, company is very matrixed"
1242,5.0,There is a fair amount of self learning as the company rapidly expands. The montly demands can be taxing but always well worth it.
1243,5.0,And there's no shortage of work.
1244,4.0,- flexibility of schedule can be minimal
1245,5.0,None what so ever!
1246,5.0,one may feel stuck working on the platform
1247,4.0,"Management in recruiting is stale and needs change. The favoritism in recruiting is VERY apparent. Dating within the recruiting org causes favortism. The metrics given to a recruiter per quarter can be really tough, but what is worse is that they never end. And there does not seem to be any thought to looking at a recruiter's past performance. Not every quarter is going to be #1 and that shouldn't mean they need to be reviewed or shamed."
1248,5.0,- Very fast paced - Growing geographic footprint is hard to overcome during travel freezes
1249,3.0,"Unfortunately, all of the above is not available across the board. My manager has, short of explicitly saying it, told us we can only volunteer 15 hours a year, to create only one career development goal, “he doesn’t care what it is”, rolls his eyes at the thought of us taking advantage of the company’s championed cause of meditation, told us we aren’t allowed to take ANY time off for a six month period every single year. And to top it off, he’s the biggest micromanager I have ever worked for in my career. You better be the first one there, and last to leave, finishing work at home doesn’t “count”. And not once, has he ever complimented or commended any of us. Doctor appointment? Have a family commitment during the week? Better not make a habit of it. God forbid you have something going on that requires frequent doctor visits. If we want to grow our skill sets via Trailhead, better do it after hours or on the weekend. Mind you, I talk to other people in the company and they are appalled that this is happening. My ratings are based on my specific experience, and do not represent the typical Salesforce experience. I thought it was just him, and some of it certainly is, but the whole department is toxic. There’s turnover left and right, every couple of weeks it seems another coworker chooses to leave the company. And if the VP cared, they would do something. It’s blatant. I have thought of raising the issue to HR but it’s obvious these people have been here a long time, and make someone above them happy, so it’s pointless."
1250,1.0,"Salesforce produces Entitled and quite frankly, arrogant people. They tell you to pat yourself on the back because ""its harder to get into Salesforce than Harvard""... people repeat this at bootcamp, when they didn't even attend Harvard. Training is all online Trailhead badges, and not personal training with objection handling, interaction and just a bunch of ""Salesforce is the best and the competitor sucks"", their management and team breeds arrogance, ignorance and lack of humanity. Salesforce is all smoke and mirrors, great place to work, but their sales teams all stab eachother in the back. Try asking people about the relationships between EMEA and NorthAmerica on accounts. They claim #1 place to work but ask around, people get sick of being a cog in the corporate system. Salesforce is great marketers but peel back the onion, on integrating the clouds."
1251,5.0,"This can be a pro and a con, it is very young culture, the average age is 29."
1252,5.0,None so far as I'm in my 1st month.
1253,5.0,"It is a very large company, so you might not get to interact with as many people or have the same influence that you would in a much smaller company."
1254,5.0,"Upper management can sometimes become mismanaged, causing miscommunications down the line"
1255,5.0,None that I can think of
1256,5.0,I don't have any cons at this point!
1257,5.0,"Direct team is all over the US, making it difficult to connect on a day-to-day basis."
1258,5.0,I have been at Salesforce for a month now and I do not have any cons.
1259,5.0,SF location is congested and can be trying for commuters.
1260,5.0,It's a fast paced place so it can be hard to keep up but this also keeps things interesting and challenging.
1261,1.0,Management and Vice Presidents (repeat it)
1262,3.0,"Fake culture - depending on your department, all the ""best place to work"" image isn't true. Salesforce spends a lot of money making the company look amazing but internally, they don't treat their employees that great (depending on department of course). Company also wastes a lot of money on frivolous things just to add to this image"
1263,5.0,"All territories are not created equally (although the effort is there to make it as equitable as possible). It's a grind and the pressure is there, but for the driven individual the results are worth it."
1264,5.0,"Not sure, i am very new to Salesforce and still learning."
1265,5.0,None that I can currently think of at the moment.
1266,4.0,"Salesforce has aggressive growth targets, which are crucial to success and maintaining market leadership; however, management isn't properly equipped to handle the pressure from above and translate that message in a way that motivates employees."
1267,4.0,"Really large intern cohort (300+ in sf alone), so felt a bit lost among all the interns. Although the apartments are all nice, the locations varied widely. I could walk to work easily, but I know people who had to bus 30-40 minutes to get to work. Teamwise, I know some interns who weren't as lucky as me and ended up in teams who barely interacted outside of work (i.e. no eating together during lunch). What team you end up on all seems to boil down to luck (you interview directly for a team vs having a team matching process)."
1268,5.0,Several years into my career at Salesforce and I can't think of one specific to my current role. Is that cheesy? Maybe. Is it honest? Absolutely.
1269,3.0,- Work life balance and treatment vary greatly by leader. - Politics are scarily prevalent - Lack of common courtesy and aggressiveness is the norm by some senior leaders - Known morale and personnel issues are not handled if the individual doing so is a demographic actively courted by the company and used in press releases
1270,2.0,"Management are given too much power to determine who will succeed and fail. Managers will choose favorites and provide them with 5x the amount of accounts (150-200), while others are given (20-35) and they fail. Timing, territory and talent (in that order) determine success, but I’ve watched too many qualified candidates be “coached out,” while managers can’t staff a full team. Also the pay is low compared to our competition."
1271,5.0,"Not much to say here, other than SF seems to pay slightly less than Microsoft (at least up front), but still competitive. If you're going to play in CRM though, why not work for the leader?"
1272,3.0,Sales is a grind with lots of micro-managing and overwhelming asks from management
1273,5.0,None at this time that I can think of.
1274,5.0,- Hiring lots of ex-Oracle folks who don't quite fit the 'Ohana' culture - Still a whirlwind if you can't manage your workload and time - No clear advancement path - I asked my leadership & was told to wait in the queue as others were here first. - Doing good work often is rewarded with more work than one can handle with a high degree of quality
1275,5.0,"-Catered lunches/dinners means it's easy to gain weight. -Since we are are still pretty young, the upper management is composed of mainly people who were here at the beginning. This means they can be a mixed bag in terms of actual competence/managerial ability."
1276,5.0,"Depending on your position, there can be a lot of mandatory training/certifications and not all of them are actually applicable to your everyday job. This isn't a big con, more of a minor annoyance that we all learn to live with."
1277,5.0,Really not much to say here. Even if I did not get the job I would have just applied again until I got it.
1278,5.0,- Trying to figure out where I'll be sitting / changing buildings to in the next few weeks - Not having two screens to work from
1279,3.0,"San Francisco based culture and values (tend to ignore other cultures in other parts of world). Sole focus on margin and growth at all costs - buying companies faster than they can be incorporated into the company. If you are not in their Core business, you can be easily forgotten. Cliques by Millennials (as if it’s high school). Managers only care if you show up in a report for a negative metric, otherwise they have no interest in talking with you."
1280,4.0,- Rapid growth brings forth concerns that the culture will change from being dynamic and exciting to becoming more regulated and corporate - May be too structured for some tastes - A lot of office politics involved with job advancement
1281,4.0,"It's getting very political with the change of the guard to a more Oracle centric management team. Territories are thinly sliced and watered down unless you're in the good graces of your manager or the most senior person on your team, and if you're stuck with a bad one someone has to leave or get promoted for you to get a bigger slice. Work life balance is so/so...each manager determines if you can work from home with no real ""program"". Base salaries are below average in the industry."
1282,5.0,"They will work you to death, but they certainly compensate you for it. Pockets of very aggressive and non collaborative people in senior level positions."
1283,4.0,"Company is over-reliant on the heroic effort of its individuals in operations and development teams. There can be burn-out. Some departments struggle with too many people who want to manage or coordinate work, and not enough people to actually get it done. Unpredictable hiring freezes will often negatively impact a group's ability to scale."
1284,5.0,"Lots of internal politics, no surprise at any big company this isn't Salesforce specific it happens everywhere. Promos are about timing mainly."
1285,5.0,growth can be dependent on which cloud you work in
1286,4.0,"Sometimes boring work Not too many interesting ML teams, especially in Bellevue"
1287,5.0,"None, none, none, none, none"
1288,5.0,"if you are a self starter then you'll love this self service environment. if you need your hand held, then look elsewhere."
1289,3.0,Can be bureaucratic at times. A lot of people are doing boring work or work they aren't passionate about. The company does a bad job keeping people placed on teams or projects that they're passionate about. There were volunteer events that seemed like they were more for the instagram page or press release than for actually helping the community which was very disappointing to see.
1290,5.0,Maybe growing too fast. Dreamforce is a mess.
1291,5.0,"Hard to think of a con....... More of a concern: as Salesforce continues to grow, will it be able to keep it's focus on the customer and maintain it's amazing culture"
1292,5.0,Not for everyone Monthly Cadence Lots of Pressure
1293,5.0,Decision makers within organization are not always clear
1294,5.0,I have not experienced any negative issues so far
1295,5.0,* Can be hard to navigate and find out who to talk to * Management can be difficult to reach
1296,1.0,terrible location to commute to. we came through a buy out. first year was good. second year was bad. All top people of my startup were forced out after less then 2 years. we were given crap tasks to do after a year with tons of politics and terrible management. Management changes by the minute.
1297,5.0,All positive feedback at this time.
1298,5.0,Parking & Commute. Works better with Company provided shuttle or public transit
1299,5.0,"Cannot think of any, I can hardly think of a day when I have not been happy."
1300,1.0,Recruiting mngt and the company only care about hitting a hiring number. Example: the sales recruiting org made a Saturday and Sunday the start date for over 50 account execs at end of fiscal year and pre feb 1 (beginning of the fiscal year). Totally gaming the system and many cases of people “starting” at salesforce while still employed by other companies. The recruiting org used to be great. Strived for hitting an aggressive number but doing it the right way. Current practices sacrifice quality and frankly are not legal (double dipping on employment)
1301,4.0,Travel and irrational clients. Difficult to be heard when assigned to a project well underway.
1302,3.0,Long days and long nights
1303,5.0,Haven't come across any so far.
1304,4.0,"-Uneven balance on who makes money right now -SB segment doing great, GRB(level above) struggling big time -New territory every February 1 -Little room for Growth"
1305,5.0,It's a 20 year old company which means it has some baggage associated with it. That can be good or bad depending on how you look at it. The bad part is some of the bureaucracy and barriers to getting things done. But really that's somewhat expected for a large company.
1306,5.0,"You can get cornered into boring work or dead-end roles If you don't get along with your manager, you should change teams Typical big corporation stuff, like risk aversion and re-orgs"
1307,4.0,"It is so disciplined that it is difficult to find time for brain storming, need to keep everything predictable and get results, little research investment."
1308,4.0,"Salesforce has not been able to produce final compensation plans for the year and it's near September. Also the comp plan was massive shift in the companies favor (maybe to pay for recent acq's). Details in comp plan effect percentage payout, and they know the sales folks are up to speed on it now. Most enterprise software commissions for sales are in the 7-13% range. Salesforce has let a room full of analysts change it so you make 3% if you don't sell the type of contract they want. A lot of talented sales folks have left."
1309,2.0,Working for Salesforce and lack of company Trust.
1310,4.0,"What happens when a the World's Most Innovative Company hires almost exclusively from a company that doesn't even crack the top 100? The culture changes. We become less innovative, more hierarchical, less transparent, less appreciative. It is well known: if you want to move into management, the best way is to leave and come back. Diversity is a good thing, including diversity of experience."
1311,5.0,Have not seen any so far.
1312,5.0,"-San Francisco has it's pros and cons, nothing with salesforce"
1313,1.0,"Salesforce allows people to manage that have no previous management experience therefore do not know how to coach and help team members advance in their own careers. When an associate isn't a good fit for a role or team based on how biased they feel in a group of ""bros"" (manager included), there needs to be a better avenue for letting said associate explore other opportunities within the organization instead of immediately being fired without a good reason."
1314,5.0,"It is easy to say there are NO Cons in this company! They continue to grow and still continue to support their customers, employees, and the community."
1315,5.0,Nothing here to comment on at this time
1316,5.0,It can be difficult negotiating raises.
1317,5.0,"Nothing as of yet, and I do not see anything that could be a Con"
1318,5.0,"The fast paced environment and obsession with quality maybe unsettling initially. But once you get used to it, you will echo the same sentiments."
1319,4.0,Shrinking territories and increasing quotas every year. Accounts change hands regularly (every year is typical). Customers feel like their AEs are revolving doors. Overachieved my goal number and did not make club.
1320,5.0,can be too comfortable at some point
1321,5.0,Have not experienced a con yet.
1322,5.0,I honestly can not think of anything
1323,4.0,"Bureaucracy, product falling behind, constant T&E restrictions"
1324,5.0,- Lots of moving pieces across accounts as more acquisitions take place - Some prospects don't understand Salesforces value beyond the CRM product creating objections in the marketplace - Depending on your territory you can find yourself traveling 90% of the time
1325,5.0,"nothing yet, I'm 1 month in."
1326,5.0,No cons observed at this time
1327,5.0,None so far. Nones so far. That's one way to meed the 5 word minimum
1328,5.0,None I can think of
1329,5.0,"It's extremely fast paced so be prepared to train and work from day one. However, I will say the resources are available to succeed. Just be ready for the challenge."
1330,5.0,"Don't get everything right out of the gates, but adjusts quickly. Be comfortable with iteration and imperfection."
1331,3.0,"The company is too big, feel lost"
1332,5.0,Advancement opportunities are limited in some areas.
1333,5.0,"Very white leadership, micromanaged culture"
1334,3.0,Due to fast growth poor quality of products
1335,5.0,Wish there were more opportunities to work remotely.
1336,5.0,"Tough and expensive for those in the North Bay to get to HQ (no shuttles). Otherwise, so thrilled to be working for Salesforce."
1337,5.0,"Nothing major - Many of the instructions are 80% complete - you need to be smart and figure out the last 20% (mostly to do with fast paced, and changing processes)"
1338,5.0,I Can't think of any.
1339,5.0,I can't find any yet!
1340,5.0,I can't think of a con - happy to be part of #SalesforceOhana!
1341,5.0,I don't see any Cons
1342,3.0,Long hours and a lot of travel.
1343,5.0,"Not a lot of clarity in career development in some roles, which can be an opportunity to define your own path within the company, but also a curse for those who don't know how to navigate their career development"
1344,5.0,-Direction can change on a moments notice
1345,5.0,- Ramping up requires a heavy load of new information starting up which can sometimes be explained in an inconsistent order
1346,4.0,"Career progress is often a jungle gym, not a ladder. You have to be okay with that if you work here."
1347,5.0,"Stressful, starting to turn into oracle pt2"
1348,3.0,"- Being in the field is vastly different than working at headquarters or at a large site - Premium pricing and increased competition can create difficult sales environment - There is definitely an ""every man for himself"" attitude in the field"
1349,2.0,"- Very little technical innovation (large monolithic Java code bases, decades of technical debt) - The executive has little visibility over business units, leading some (see: Security) to have an absolutely atrocious, toxic culture - Performance evaluation is entirely opaque, no published process for progression, employee success (aka human resources) are extremely opaque - Company values are largely public fanfare, not enacted internally (see above re: HR) - Don't have diverse political opinions if you want to work here (lean hard to the left)"
1350,5.0,"Some growing pains but they recognize and act upon it quickly, rather than blaming employees Employees work hard here, yet management emphasizes wellness to avoid burnout"
1351,4.0,Not clear what future opportunities exist at the company.
1352,5.0,"At the SLC office specifically we went through a double acquirement recently, so we've definitely been going through a transition period. Sometimes not being at HQ (San Francisco) you feel like your office is overlooked. SLC office is a pretty old building. These are pretty small complaints though and are getting better all the time."
1353,5.0,"- Like most large companies, there are lots of resources but you have to know where to look for them - TBD, I haven't worked here for too long"
1354,5.0,None that I can think of so far
1355,5.0,Some of the onboarding and process documentation is lacking.
1356,5.0,"The organization is huge, which makes it hard to meet everyone !"
1357,5.0,None that I can think of
1358,4.0,pays 70% of market related to work expected
1359,4.0,"Constant restructuring, would need a high level of discipline to take charge of your career, easy to get lost and get silo-ed. Different orgs rarely interact with each other"
1360,5.0,"Not much really, the experience is as good as you make it"
1361,5.0,I don't think there are any cons of working here.
1362,5.0,Like any large organization it has some challenges. The pace of change if fast.
1363,5.0,I haven't experience any negatives thus far.
1364,2.0,"inflexible work schedule and not a great work life balance,High level of micromanagement and lot of push on transactional cycles"
1365,4.0,"On-boarding is lengthy and deadlines for training are a bit tight, reducing how much you’ll retain. Duplicate topics and content in the new-hire training (trailhead). System sprawl. Many different systems, apps, are in use, probably at least partly due to acquisitions. Many complicated, multi-step login procedures for different systems. Too many TLA’s (three letter acronyms). Too many sweets (cake, ice cream, candy) available."
1366,5.0,Nothing worth mentioning as of now.
1367,5.0,I haven't really experienced any cons so far.
1368,5.0,"Management can struggle with direction, and fail to pass that on to the team. Employee's can often slack off and not be held accountable/responsible for work"
1369,5.0,You can get fat as free snacks and soda around.
1370,1.0,"In the name of taking ownership, the leadership lets the team-members fight it out like dogs for their next project, promotional cycle, bonus, performance-review etc. This is especially true in their CRM Analytics group in San Francisco. The middle management (Senior Managers and Directors) suck with their petty office politics and leadership politics. This whole concept of Hybrid engineers is a big sham and is affecting the quality of their product."
1371,5.0,6 months in and have yet to find any
1372,1.0,"You basically work in a sweatshop as an AE. I’d honestly love know who they are interviewing and how Salesforce is winning “best company to work for” because it’s definitely not the sales team. Quotas are completely impossible to hit. I had a 1.1 million dollar quota for a territory that made $200,000 TOTAL the year before. You tell me how that adds up?! On top of that, I was putting in 11-12 hour work days (which is encouraged, might I add) and only making 3% commission on every deal I closed even though I grew my little territory over 80%. You make no money here, you are not compensated fairly and when brought up to management they sweep it under the rug and deflect. Management and leadership plays favorites and gives larger, More tech savvy territories to AEs who are not skilled but rather, who they party with. Yet we all have the same quotas (unless you actually have a lower quota bc you’re a favorite too)."
1373,5.0,Nothing to report at this time.
1374,5.0,"Big company, easy to get lost."
1375,5.0,territories are small compensation plans
1376,2.0,"Uber policial on social issues, but only when the Salesforce machine can generate free press and market share awareness. The company as a whole discriminates against older employees, in favor of millennials. Ignored the social issue going on at the border, due to having larger contracts with the federal government."
1377,5.0,"Fast paced, dynamic and demanding environment with consistent expectation to deliver above quota. Salesforce ""way"" of conducting business can be overwhelming."
1378,4.0,"Due to lots of acquisitions, the company has been tightening travel restrictions. If you work remote or in a satellite office, you'll get few opportunities to meet with your team face to face. It can be quite isolating. If you work on infrastructure (syseng/neteng), this can be a pretty frustrating place to work. Innovation is always encouraged, but security policies, politics, and business relationships end up driving what we can ultimately deliver."
1379,5.0,"It's hard work, sometimes advancement can be difficult or ambiguous"
1380,5.0,Things move at a face pace. It's not for everyone but I find it to be a lot of fun
1381,1.0,"Favoritism by management. Accounts are hand selected so that favorites make their number while others are given ""whitespace"" accounts that don't buy. Marketing cloud is selling while service cloud is floundering."
1382,2.0,If your not on Core/Running the account strategy then your an overlay sales person for one of the recently acquired applications. 1) You can't control your own number 2) Your management runs you buy a spreadsheet
1383,5.0,Work/Life Balance can be better
1384,5.0,- No lunches - Limited perks
1385,4.0,"Do what you can to not work in the Salt Lake City office. They're a newly acquired (2017) company and still stuck in the 'small company' mindset. Work/Life Balance won't be possible, in my opinion, at newly acquired companies without a backbone as they will try to appease upper management they've never met by asking their teams to complete impossible tasks."
1386,4.0,Bureaucratic. Some teams are not really up to the task which in turn results in bad quality of product ofcourse. Big mouth wins talent many times unfortunately.
1387,5.0,"Fast paced environment , difficult scope with grow scale"
1388,4.0,Not enough room for innovation
1389,5.0,"I'm sure I'll find something that bothers me, but as of yet I really don't have any cons."
1390,5.0,have a lot to learn very fast moving
1391,5.0,. Not to great engineering practices
1392,4.0,so many AEs and territorites getting carved up smaller and smaller. In the commercial business unit all of the customers are already oversold. Hard to make money
1393,5.0,Some people get stressed by the fast-paced nature of the job and monthly quotas
1394,5.0,More frequent change than any company in my 20 years of experience
1395,5.0,"Fast moving with the training and projects, seems a bit like drinking from a firehose."
1396,5.0,Meetings and distractions that come working for a huge corporation.
1397,5.0,None so far that I can think of.
1398,5.0,So far so good .
1399,5.0,Less of a Con and more of a challenge to be aware of: You will have lots to learn--even if you previously worked in the Salesforce ecosystem!
1400,4.0,"The economy is forcing Salesforce to eliminate some of the previous benefits like company phones, car plans"
1401,5.0,Information overload! The Salesforce product suite is extremely robust and it takes time to feel comfortable understanding the full extent by which it can help customers grow and innovate.
1402,3.0,"too big to innovate ,depends on team"
1403,5.0,territory roulette can have very negative impact on earnings
1404,4.0,"Unlike other companies in the Bay area, Salesforce is a very marketing- and sales-led company. While engineers and product owners are encouraged to innovate and make an impact, the founders are very much in charge, and the company is driven by Dreamforce and marketing messaging. (Despite this, hard work can also make a huge impact, even when it's not aligned with Marketing, Sales, Dreamforce)"
1405,4.0,- Outdated and antique waterfall process for infrastructure planning and service that hinders innovation - Synergy is lacking across different clouds within Salesforce. Internal duplication and contentions between different cloud is inevitable - Heavy interdependencies between groups and departments makes it hard to make any meaningful progress in an agile way
1406,5.0,"Always connected means always on - must personally manage to have balance Extremely fast-paced environment feels ""start-up"" like but lack of standardization and process maturity can be counterproductive in a large organization (ironically should drink own Kool-Aid) Too much time spent 'figuring it out'"
1407,5.0,"The work can be demanding, requiring 60 and 70 hour weeks at times depending on the season (business reviews, product launches, events, etc.)."
1408,5.0,"None to speak of, keep up the great work."
1409,5.0,The company has grown so quickly that often the left hand doesn't seem to know what the right hand is doing which may create overlap in activities which reduces efficiency.
1410,5.0,"It is hard to find a con when you are genuinely so pleased with where you work. The usual cons, similar to any company would be the politics or bureaucracy."
1411,5.0,"We are now almost 40K, so it helps to be good at navigating people and get your EQ skills on."
1412,4.0,work life balance is challenging. It is exciting but the strain of growing this quickly shows in operational areas and some of the things you would take for granted at more mature companies haven't evolved. Lots of initiatives to 'solve problems' internally go no where and are forgotten in a quarter
1413,3.0,"Workload is neverending. Sales expects teams to respond at all hours of the day. Support teams are not scaled along with the hiring growth. Company message that employees and work/life balance are valued is not consistent with the actual work environment. Long hours and pushes at quarter ends to close deals. Love the corporate culture drive to volunteer as a community and attend social events, but feel stressed by the time away from work hours and needing to make up the work after hours."
1414,5.0,"It's a cloud based company that is mostly service orientated; they have mobile teams, but they are minor in the scheme of things and you aren't going to be working on the cutting edge of tech."
1415,2.0,"Terrible work-life balance, they expect long hours and push you extremely hard with not a lot of recognition or performance appreciation. They unfairly pay women employees even though there has been an effort to correct it. In the Sales organization is still a very close-knit boys club with no women leaders. Politics will get the best of you rather than actually focusing on getting the job done"
1416,3.0,The Chicago office is a boys club. Lots of senior sales leaders/VP’s got away with inappropriate behavior for a long time due to lack of HR presence in the office. Very political and promotions are a popularity contest. Also needs more racial and gender diversity-much improved but still a long way to go.
1417,5.0,"No real downsides, asides from certain logistical shortfalls that are common among larger, older tech firms. But this really only applies to working on the core Salesforce platform. There are numerous acquisitions and fringe projects that are not subject to this lack of agility, and Salesforce gives you the option to shop for opportunities elsewhere in the company."
1418,2.0,"*Sharp learning curve, you sink or swim *With each acquisition, workload increased while team did not grow at the same rate *Work life balance was very difficult, you are expected to be on all the time *Inexperienced middle management *When something went wrong, little or no management support"
1419,5.0,None that I have seen
1420,5.0,Cant think of any or see anything coming up that would be considered a con.
1421,5.0,None I have encountered so far.
1422,4.0,"seems like a ton of separation from executive team and lowly peons like myself. You almost just do what you're told, not really opportunities to develop your own strategies or ideas."
1423,3.0,"Reorganization, company is getting too large"
1424,5.0,With growth comes challenges - Core teams can be somewhat myopic at times when looking outside the more typical applications and customer pain. The path to competence can be painful - not because the documentation isn't there - but because there is so much to learn and more is available daily. I can see that real competence will develop closer to a year (or more) out. You have to have the intestinal fortitude to get through that.
1425,5.0,"So far, not much."
1426,4.0,"1. See #3 above— can actually be too much info to digest- you can get lost on the “trails” and the next thing you know tomorrow is today! 2. Not much else, which is a good sign!"
1427,4.0,"Salesforce is behind on Data Science. The leadership does not yet promote the technical infrastructure, institutional support, or data literacy to carry out modern data science."
1428,5.0,"None so far, everything has been great."
1429,5.0,"A lot gets thrown at you when you first start, but like I stated in the ""Pros"", you have a ton of support."
1430,5.0,None at this time - keep the emphasis on the customer and product
1431,5.0,No cons at this time.
1432,2.0,"My team was one of the most exclusive, alcoholic I've ever seen. They would intentionally exclude me from every team dinner by choosing exclusively steak houses. They got drunk every single night they were in town. Team dynamics were such that you couldn't get ahead unless you were in on this click."
1433,5.0,Nothing that I can think of.
1434,5.0,I cannot think of any! I had a great experience!
1435,5.0,"It is a very large company, so you might not get to interact with as many people or have the same influence that you would in a much smaller company."
1436,5.0,Sometimes the promotions are questionable. The process is 100% questionable - but this is a big initiative from our CMO - to offer more visibility into this.
1437,5.0,- Rapid growth and change has blurred career path - Most opportunity is in San Francisco; Need more opportunity outside to reflect a global company - Growth has challenged culture
1438,5.0,Sometimes we run out of snacks and it takes awhile before the snacks get refreshed. No company shuttle service from the East Bay.
1439,5.0,"If transparency and collaboration aren't for you, this may not be the dream job you are looking for."
1440,5.0,"In the short time I was there, I did not find any downsides."
1441,3.0,"On the lower end of wages for top companies in the bay area. Middle management seems to be chosen by expediency (timing, willingness) rather than talent in some cases. Company's falling down point is in middle management and lack of rep training. Many new acquisitions and products that reps aren't trained to sell."
1442,4.0,- Managers micromanage. This is a very metrics driven org where KPIs are assessed every week. - Territories are getting smaller and smaller - OTE is achievable but it's hard to hit your monthly quota month over month.
1443,5.0,Great neighborhood but comes at a cost of commute time
1444,5.0,"- Large amounts of reorgs can cause some whiplash and lack of cohesive work - Some legacy products - Some engineering teams have it way worse than others (in terms of WLB, On Call Schedule, Client Complaints etc)"
1445,5.0,None to date but I will check back after the 1 year mark
1446,5.0,"Being a remote employee I wish we had dedicated monthly times to take trips to work/meet with your team! With that being said, they have no problem with remote employees taking the time to go visit and immerse themselves with their teams. I just wish it was more frequent and scheduled!"
1447,4.0,- Growing pains - Overly sales-driven
1448,3.0,"Teams feel disconnected, there is not much communication between management and employees. Also notice that it's hard to chart a career course here."
1449,5.0,I have no cons for Salesforce
1450,5.0,Pay is not as high as similarly situated companies and promotions/advancement are harder to come by and not as clear how it's done.
1451,5.0,"If you're not willing to work hard in a fast paced environment, this is not the place for you."
1452,5.0,"So far, no cons seem to arise, other than the fact that the fast paced environment seems ripe for burning out if not careful."
1453,5.0,- Must be okay with being metrics driven.
1454,5.0,It's really competitive to get a job here. But once you're a part of the Ohana it's fantastic.
1455,4.0,Frequent reorgs and Office politics
1456,5.0,There is constant and rapid change so it's easy to feel overwhelmed
1457,5.0,"We work hard, so it's important to enjoy what you do here!"
1458,5.0,Some people may not like fully open seating offices / lack of privacy (although there are phone booth rooms when needed. No transit benefit Dependencies on other teams can feel slow
1459,5.0,- Very corporate environment - This can lead to a lot of 'office politics' which could be viewed as either a pro or con - Less than competitive compensation
1460,5.0,dependency on HQ older technology stack
1461,5.0,"slow pace, slow project progress."
1462,5.0,RSU refresh program is not good for long time employees
1463,5.0,"Not working at the corporate headquarters has the same disadvantages as at any other company, although multiple channels of communication and a strong commitment to transparency definitely help. Open-office layouts have the usual noise issues. Each employee can expense a set of noise-cancelling headphones."
1464,5.0,There are none I am able to share at this time.
1465,5.0,"Sometimes, there can be some politics and with its rapidly growing pace, there can be challenges with that growth. Change is a constant, which means you have to constantly adapt."
1466,5.0,Not the best on-boarding/training....didn't feel very supported throughout my time as I actually began doing the job. I was often times told to read articles or ask someone else vs. being offered assistance from my manager or direct team
1467,5.0,Being remote it can sometimes be difficult to feel like I am ramping at an appropriate pace but this is the nature of being remote. Too many meetings
1468,5.0,"if you are a self starter then you'll love this self service environment. if you need your hand held, then look elsewhere."
1469,5.0,"- Unsure how promotions are decided upon, would like to see performance & peer reviews used to help decide promotions. - Lots of growth, change is constant and makes it difficult to get things done sometimes."
1470,5.0,"There are some due to so many recent acquisitions, but are expected."
1471,3.0,"That said the compensation is a quagmire of BS. First you can already expect an OTE significantly less than what is the norm in the industry. Worse still is the 40 acts of vaudeville to figure out if you will get paid, if you get paid and what amount they base it on. We are out there saying use Salesforce as your system of record and every month my Xactly has little similarity to my sales in Salesforce. Come on, guys. Let's not be hypocrites! Then when you think it can get no worse there is a virtual rubics cube of ways you lose ACV or see $ clawed back. You have to be an accountant to figure out if you can sell to an account and retire quota. It's ridiculous how many times, in a short time I have not gotten the full value of my sale due to some arbitrary attrition I was not even aware of as a co-prime. Do you want me to sell or do you want me to audit the accounts to see if I can retire quota with a sale?"
1472,5.0,Midwestern pay but cost of living in Indy is so low that this isn't really a Con. Much more opportunities for salary growth once you prove your worth. No complaints!
1473,5.0,"Popularity matters for promotions. All people I see getting promoted are great at what they do, but a lot of people who are great at what they do don't get promoted."
1474,5.0,"The work can be slow and dull at times. Occasionally there are fun scaling problems, but that's not the norm."
1475,5.0,Paid under market value and it's tough to rise through the ranks via promotion with the company being so large
1476,5.0,"navigation through the organization chain, little or less clarity on what is going on at higher level."
1477,4.0,"- Have encountered ""too many cooks in the kitchen"" phenomenon, sometimes leaving things difficult to get done efficiently and effectively. - (Similar to other tech companies) Autonomy-focused culture makes for difficulty in making decisions because everyone's opinion must be heard (and accepted) - Still determining whether there's really the opportunity to suggest something different and prompt change. They say it is, but I have seen an actual tendency to stay within a ""safe"" box. Still TBD."
1478,5.0,- Trying to figure out where I'll be sitting / changing buildings to in the next few weeks - Not having two screens to work from
1479,5.0,Pretty large company - makes it hard to get a full look at everything
1480,5.0,It can be difficult to understand the nature of specific roles until you are into conversations with hiring managers.
1481,5.0,"Monthly cadence can be tough to keep up with, but management works with you to align with personal & professional goals to overcome the hustle."
1482,5.0,I'm often glad I no longer work there
1483,5.0,"At this point, nothing that I can think of. Though the interview process (for a Solution Engineer role) was quite challenging and time consuming. That’s not necessarily a con, as it allowed me to prove my value and interest in the organization, but it was something that was a little unexpected."
1484,5.0,Harder to build relationships with your team since you won't see them face to face as much. Everyone can work from home. So many resources and tools you need to learn from. It could be confusing at first.
1485,4.0,Monthly cadence for sales organization is difficult. The pressure to perform monthly sometimes works at cross purposes of developing a trusted advisor/relationship status with your clients.
1486,5.0,"If you are looking to coast this is not the place. They demand passion, energy, and helping all colleagues to achieve a customer focused company. If you the type of person who has said ""that is not my job"" then you will not fit the culture. Everyone at Salesforce is like a big family and you must contribute."
1487,5.0,"Nothing really! Location (DT Palo Alto) is kind of a pain, since interns can't get parking permits."
1488,5.0,Some old technology. Salesforce is a successful business running on an 18 year old application.
1489,5.0,"As they grow and expand the tribal knowledge can be challenging. Gmail and suite is TERRIBLE! Hours are wasted in finding, sorting etc., email. Calendar and conferencing tools need improvement"
1490,5.0,"At this point, nothing that I can think of. Though the interview process (for a Solution Engineer role) was quite challenging and time consuming. That’s not necessarily a con, as it allowed me to prove my value and interest in the organization, but it was something that was a little unexpected."
1491,4.0,"Unlike other companies in the Bay area, Salesforce is a very marketing- and sales-led company. While engineers and product owners are encouraged to innovate and make an impact, the founders are very much in charge, and the company is driven by Dreamforce and marketing messaging. (Despite this, hard work can also make a huge impact, even when it's not aligned with Marketing, Sales, Dreamforce)"
1492,2.0,"Uber policial on social issues, but only when the Salesforce machine can generate free press and market share awareness. The company as a whole discriminates against older employees, in favor of millennials. Ignored the social issue going on at the border, due to having larger contracts with the federal government."
1493,5.0,Can't think of any right now.
1494,5.0,"Some processes are still painfully manual, some ""Face time"" obligations."

1500,5.0,None that I can think of
1501,5.0,"Personal con is that my commute takes now longer. Luckly, Salesforce provides shuttles to/from SF."
1502,4.0,Finding the right managers and mentors is critical to finding rewarding opportunities to grow. It is important that you always be looking for new opportunities. Staying in one position for too long may get you typecast as a professional that can't grow or go in new directions.
1503,5.0,None that come to mind
1504,4.0,"Work is really your main focus, both from 8-5 and then afterwards with your team. Super young employee population....not great for those with a family."
1505,5.0,Very fast paced and time consuming tasks
1506,5.0,None that I can think of besides a common tech company perk - food
1507,5.0,Salesforce is growing at an astounding rate and the challenge is to keep its character intact.
1508,4.0,The company is huge and very bureaucratic. I have strange rules for sales people and have hired too many people for the number of accounts.
1509,5.0,"- You can feel ""left-behind"" here at times, so it's crucial to stay organized to keep up with the pace, especially early on. - Work-life balance (self-induced): it's easy to become attached to your work and your accounts, and it trickle over into your personal life after hours, or on weekends. - Difficult quota to hit, but that's for a reason. if this were easy I suppose they would let anyone in. Can't think of anything else. It's hard to find things wrong with Salesforce, in fact this section took me a lot longer to provide the bullet points above then the pros section."
1510,5.0,No Cons as of yet.
1511,5.0,Very competitive to get a job change
1512,3.0,T&E - little to no budget for team events or travel to see customers/team members Cliquey - execs mostly keep to themselves Where's Marc? Haven't heard him on a Quarterly Call in awhile...
1513,5.0,There are truly no cons about working at Salesforce. I love everything about this company. Keep doing what you’re doing.
1514,4.0,No free lunch or dinner
1515,4.0,Constantly asked to do double what you did before in half the time. Very easy to burnout and you constantly feel like your feet are to the fire.
1516,4.0,"Rapid pace of innovation and growth cause issues with adoption, and support of new technologies. New technology is often released without adequate testing, and support can lag behind in learning and adopting new technology."
1517,2.0,"- Work environment is highly politicized in projects, promotions, and basically anything you do - Not everyone is pulling their own weight - Very little accountability in the organization. The company did away with formal performance reviews a few years ago. There is a culture of praise here, so constructive feedback is rarely given - Roles and teams are incredibly silo'd now. This is not the place to be if you're looking to grow and develop your career in a multitude of different ways - Easy to get lost in the sea of things: the company has grown way too large in recent years - Growth and progression are slow. Career development is non-existent if you remain in your current position. Since there are so many employees now, each job that an employee has is incredibly specific, so if you want a change of pace, you'd have to change out of your role entirely Also, for what it's worth, I strongly believe that Salesforce actively reaches out to news outlets and pays to get on those ""Best Employer"" lists that come out yearly. I wouldn't be surprised if they had people in HR write numerous positive reviews to artificially inflate the Glassdoor scores."

1523,4.0,"Working on the core Salesforce product can be a huge pain and giant time sink. They've let it go way too long to address the numerous issues that make developing on it a pain. The company also has a bad habit of Not Invented Here Syndrome, so instead of using something like React for our UI we're writing our own component framework. To make matters 10x worse it's all driven by Java ;_;"
1524,5.0,-very high quotas (high commission comes from exceeding quota)
1525,4.0,Average Compensation and Perks. Big company like management.
1526,3.0,"Hybrid Engineering has pros and cons. However, in Indy, the strategy for hybrid transition is causing a significant loss in engineering productivity. First, Pros: 1.) Hybrid engineering has brought more focus on using contemporary tools for automated testing. 2.) This helps in improving system reliability and make developers better at their jobs since testing is not considered an afterthought anymore. 3.) Huge investment in automated testing upfront is a good overall strategy that will help in system scalability and reduce buggy software releases. Cons: 1.) The idea for depending more on automated testing than on manual testing has translated into demanding all manual / semi manual qa testers to learn how to code. 2.) This is the strategy that has not panned out at all. While, the self help tools like online courses, mentoring resources and in-team guidance have been a proactive ongoing effort, this approach is taking massive hits on productivity for developers as well as for testers all around. 3.) You can find developers on any given day spending quite a bit of time (hours at times) going over basic step by step process (over and over again) with the testers to resolve minority non-mission critical bugs. 4.) Testers, especially who are not from a programming background / havent coded in a while, are overwhelmed and stressed out about the tickets they have to complete each sprint. 5.) For a company that champions engineering productivity and no interruption time for developers, developers are spending less time on quality features/innovative/disruptive work and more time getting bogged down by the process+manual testing+ incremental work . Dont get me wrong, the notion of ohana is embedded deep in the organization and engineers are glad to help their peers anytime. However, this is a massive hit on productivity."
1527,5.0,"This will be the best job of your career that will take you to new heights, but it will be long hours and intense travel. Know that before signing up."
1528,5.0,There is a political bent to executive leadership that can rub some employees the wrong way.

1556,2.0,"In my case, I was working almost 4 years for this company and I resigned because I was suffering from Workplace Harassment from part of my manager with the fact of employees' success wasn't able to resolve an internal conflict and finally you finish resigning. I think it one of the principal disadvantages, some managers are not prepared to be managers and they're promoted only because they had a couple of years working in the company. Also in the interviews, they promise that you will work with the latest technologies in the market but in the case of my position I never touched Kubernetes, and SRE is only limited to monitor PagerDuty alerts and NewRelic boards."

1611,3.0,bad decision making management. Can do better with inclusion
1612,5.0,Salesforce is becoming a very large company which can bring complexity
1613,2.0,High targets which not many people exceed
1614,5.0,High salary with high risk
1615,5.0,Career growth is proportional to how aggressive/ambitious you are. This results in sometimes putting work life balance in jeopardy.

1623,4.0,A lot to take in and prioritise between always and can be hard to switch off
1624,4.0,Workfrom home only in Irland
1625,5.0,Post Covid's new Normal is a big challenge. How will Salesforce address this challenge and exit at top level.
1626,5.0,There are some internal politics on promoting

1638,5.0,lots of info / noise hard to manage sometimes but all good
1639,4.0,"Growing too fast, making it harder to communicate or get info Some roles can be demanding"
1640,2.0,"- Its all about territory and timing. Everyone says it... except for management. In 2019, only two AE's hit their number. Everyone else told and I quote ""either not up to it or not working hard enough"". The third alternative being the model isn't set up right and they have over hired AE's, but leadership tone deaf to that alternative. - Not a place to earn money as an AE unless you get one of the performing territories - There is no in country marketing resources leaning on reps to run events and drive awareness - Product over priced and NZ leadership team not armed with the ammunition to compete against Hubspot who were doing ""COVID"" deals and giving 90% off in first year - Career progression limited - Brain washing is real - New rep measures are always being introduced and feels like big brother is always watching - no consistency and the line is always moving/complicated. In the end you give up caring and focus on the old tried and tested (pipegen + closed ACV)."
1641,5.0,To be honest. I dont see any cons
1642,5.0,Trying to find its identity at the moment as it shifts from growth to profitability.
1643,5.0,No clear growth path and development opportunities.
1644,4.0,No major concerns in general

1669,2.0,"Too much sales oriented, no company culture, frequent internal org change"
1670,5.0,No such cons as of now
1671,4.0,"- Some of the co-prime sales teams are dominated by white people or those from USA, France or Australia. It does not make sense to do this in the Asia HQ. We need more Asian customer-facing employees who truly understand cultural nuances, local language and way of speaking. - Marketing could be much better when it comes to lead generation and content creation."
1672,4.0,"Work distribution is done very ADHOC level. Its both Pros as well as Cons. Pros for a person who is in the team for quite sometime, Con for a new joinee who does not know what task to pickup."
1673,4.0,Progression is difficult if you don't fit a certain age profile
1674,5.0,Slowly the processes become very enterprise like
1675,2.0,"The IT security department is highly political and externally hard to make any meaningful change. Senior leaders are there to protect themselves and have stopped focusing on helping the company or it’s customers as a whole. Senior leaders to often dictate the way something should be with very little interest in others views. Sadly departments have been siloed and are often forced to compete with each other instead of collaborating together. No matter what is said, Salesforce does very poorly when it comes to supporting remote offices. If you aren’t working at one of their major hubs on the West coast of the US, then expect very little support or compassion when it comes to working in a remote office, or a non-HQ timezone."
1676,5.0,nothing really jumps to my mind
1677,4.0,None that i can say
1678,3.0,"Bad leadership: - 1st hand observation: Current country lead for 1 of the emerging country in ASEAN is doing poor job in inspiring and bringing the team together. I have been joining the weekly call for some time and felt that he could not earn the respect from his own team member. Failed to retain talents and deliver number for 2 consecutive quarters. So far none of his inputs had been making sense to me. - 2nd hand observation: He creates toxic environments to the team and practice poor communication skills to the team with dictatorial leadership style, leaving most team member frustrated and demotivated. He would put his subordinates on the spot during team meeting and would say unnecessary comments questions during 1:1. Company need to be more transparent in terms of the approach for the country model strategy because it puts us on so much uncertainties."
1679,4.0,OTE Sales targets are unrealistic
1680,5.0,Did Not Find Out Yet
1681,2.0,"- Short term focus on ACV vs. long term customer success - No real planning - Management spends more time managing up than supporting - undermanned in key areas, overmanned in AE's (therefore smaller + capped territories) - Real change is needed - Too much admin/training etc"
1682,5.0,"- fast,changing, challenging (positive competition) - endless meetings and call ( management resort to send official email refrain conducting business related meeting on Friday.Digital detox)"
1683,4.0,Game changes very quickly and doesn't allow us to be in a project for a long time.
1684,4.0,Boiler room. Not great work life balance
1685,5.0,no restaurant in office- just snacks
1686,4.0,Nothing negative to say about Salesforce

1688,5.0,"Information overload. Having an already impressive world of solutions, with new updates, apps, integrations, or products coming up every month, is almost impossible to stay on track about all you should know. The resources are limitless and helpful but you can get lost in a huge ocean of data that can lead to a little bit of desperation. Easy to fall in an only work mindset life, and it will be your fault, not the company's. Moving into Dublin (not the most exciting and cheap city in the world) for a job will already tell enough about you. This is a demanding job with a lot of freedom and perks from the company (the company and the management are the number 1 rest, holiday and work/life balance importance praisers) but if you want to do a good job and perform as you are coming here to, expect to work very long hours and days, especially in the beginning. Don't expect to be a free bird as you used to be, probably never. Targets are ambitious and so is your compensation and benefits, so expect to be tied tight and monitored on a very regular basis. With the working from home, it has been more accentuated that some might confuse it with micromanagement. Never is enough. Like any other sales company in the world, no matter how much you sell or work, you can always be asked to do little more. Take ownership of your pipeline and expect not to get the foot out of the gas pedal until the holidays break, no matter at which number you at. The party is almost over. If you are coming from an startup, you should see Salesforce as that older brother that used to be in all of the parties getting into its mid 30's. He knows what the fun is about but is now switching into a more responsible lifestyle and will only join those parties once a month let's say."
1689,5.0,None really beside the current work from home that is not related to Salesforce
1690,5.0,It is very nice company
1691,3.0,Layoffs come out of nowhere and make no sense. Slashing entire departments and teams after reporting record Q2 earnings.

1708,5.0,It is very nice company
1709,5.0,None that comes to my mind
1710,1.0,"JP office is extremely domestic, and does not have the drive, momentum or speed which other international tech firms or a typical foreign sub company has as a working culture. Since the majority of the people in the back office has been working here for a very long time (which is a good thing in one way), many of them are not use to changes - rather prefer to stick to the norm. Ohana is one of the key culture (which is a great conceptually) in Salesforce. But in JP back office, this is recognized in a different/miss leading manner. More specifically, it's been recognized as ""protection"", rather than supporting and challenging each other for growth. This shows up as lack of ownership, professionalism and extremely conservative working style/attitude. If you try to challenge someone, you're taken in a different way. Since there's really no culture of challenging each other, it's taken very offensively --- that's still fine but the most shocking part is, senior management doesn't notice or understand anymore of the benefits of growth via challenges and constructive communication. This is one of the most disappointing aspects of this office where it doesn't show to the outer world --- I have seen another review saying ""a master of disguise"" and completely understand what it means. When joining, do not expect a high paced, competitive working style lead by professionals with strong ownership --- but rather expect a conservative environment, hence for those who are looking for growth via challenges, constructive communication and data driven decision makings, this may not be the best place for you. Money is good, but growth wise, not able to recommend."

1763,4.0,"As a member of an acquired company, I expected a bit of turbulence during the turnover period, but the disruptions were more significant than I expected.

1792,5.0,long hour working working on holidays
1793,5.0,"If I have to list a con, and emphasis on the 'have to', I'd say it requires a lot of effort. You have to want to work here for much, much more than just a pay check.

You'll be assigned an install base which is where most reps get their ACV from (this is why Salesforce acquires so much tech so they can keep customers within their ecosystem and sell them new products). If you don't have an install that is ready to buy this will impact your overall performance. Flips and inbounds will also play a big factor, depending which market you're in will ultimately determine your end results. Anyone outside of Sydney or Melbourne good luck!

1837,5.0,Aggressive growth goals sometimes is a little bit stressing!
1838,2.0,"Constant changes in both leadership and patch Accounts changes every year and if you are given a bad patch there is no understanding that the numbers may be low due to that Forget about a promotion if you dont hit your numbers, they would even hire an outsider then you if they have similar experience Its a cold call hell where you are suppose to bring in new logos all the time from a patch with ""potential""350 prospects and the data in the patch is bad. Some companies went bankrupt years ago and are still in there Maybe its bettet on other segments but SMB its not to recommend This is for the Dublin office"

1844,4.0,"If you agree to special projects your career may stagnate rather than grow. The newish job definitions created transparency, but don't always benefit the employee or the company when something outside of the box is needed. A PM working on a new product that will take a multi-year effort does not meet the requirements for their job or promotion because everything is based on an existing product and working with Scrum teams.

1900,1.0,"Your manager will be giving you pressure by doing regular nit-picking instead of giving feedback in a proper way. Folks with higher designation are always preferred, and they can give any feedback of yours that they want. If you are stuck somewhere in work, then you cannot reach out to other teammates for guidance as they if you reach out to them they will give a negative feedback of yours. Manager doesn't discern between those feedbacks and strongly believes in them as they are given by senior folks.

Some of the leaders don't even have domain knowledge. The culture became very political. Promotions were very unfairly done. No career band framework at all.

2000,2.0,"Becoming Oracle II. Impossible tiny territories with big targets for Account Execs so revolving door of top reps coming and going once they understand the harsh reality and the expectation that only 1 in 5 people make their number annually. Growth thanks to acquisitions so if you want to join, make sure to join one of these organisations and not the legacy or core organisation. Salesforce has grown into a value driven organisation; which means ""soft"" values like wellness, PTO and VTO... however as a leader, the values are revenue and ACV only so good luck balancing those two dimensions."
2001,3.0,"There are many changes in sales positions, and some members disappear immediately after joining dozens of people every month.

2006,3.0,Moves too slow Technology is old
2007,1.0,"No support from HR, managers etc they ask you for feedback that they know you can’t be 100% honest about and then blame you for not telling them once you burn out They don’t listen to the surveys we take about our managers or the company Employees are just numbers and ACV. “You are here to learn” fail once and see what happens Hypocritical behavior from people who wish to empower you, in the end they only talk the talk. Fake political positions, the CEO earns 20m a year, if he was concerned about the earth, poverty etc he would spare some for others. (Many other examples) Women are always preferred to management director positions solely because they are women and not based on their competences Team spirit is inexistant, people won’t hesitate to shame you to their manager and steal deals off you. Toxic environment"
2008,4.0,"I hate Lies, laziness, poor attitude toward work"

2018,4.0,-too much pressure on employee
2019,4.0,Nothing to say . . .
2020,2.0,"- Ohana culture is non existence. It's more like a jungle. The strongest will survive. - Damn political, very number-driven, and cut-throat culture in the sales department. - Everyone is trying to protect themself instead of working as a team. - High turnover, and everyone is burned out. - Bullying and intimidation are exist in inter-department by few high-performing employees. Management should be aware of repeat cases/ escalation but show minimal effort to address the situation."
2021,5.0,Often very busy and managing multiple tasks
2022,5.0,I don't have any cons for this company!
2023,4.0,too cooperative hence many modules regarding anything in the word
2024,4.0,Hard work with high quota
2025,5.0,"- Work culture is being poisoned by few personnel (managers), the way they lead the team, the way they expect their team to work (like in service based companies)."
2026,5.0,There are no cons here.
2027,5.0,Sometimes the company seems chaotic. We're growing so quickly that things are always changing which can feel a bit frustrating but worth it in the end!
2028,4.0,- Work Life Balance in order to hit quota - Only 20 percent of reps will hit their annual number - Territory shrinking and metrics staying the same
2029,5.0,Do not see any such cons till now.

2031,5.0,i don't see anything as of now
2032,5.0,"Super fast paced environment, policies and technology changes all the time. Work Life balance is a challenge."
2033,3.0,"What they're doing is working at a business level. The company is a rocket ship, still. But it's at the expense of its people. Below are a few of the cons I find most frustrating. - Micro Management on an extreme scale. I joined just before the pandemic and it has gotten continually worse since being forced to work from home. You don't feel trusted. - Unrealistic workloads. - Encouraged to manage your work life balance but chastised if you actually do it. I've been scolded for having my car serviced at 2pm, or taking annual leave at a quarter cut off to celebrate a birthday. - Meetings for meetings sake burning precious time. - Saturated account sets. Prospects get bombarded continually from all angles of Salesforce and have been for over a decade. - Lead generation is down to you. You have to be BDR, AE and even SE on some opportunities, unless you're in the enterprise/strategic accounts. I have not had more than 3 leads passed to me in almost 18 months. - Always an ""urgent"" action that needs to be taken. Often which is not directly impacting your ability to engage with clients."
2034,5.0,There are no cons here.
2035,5.0,"The pace can be so fast, far too many enablements. Daily changes"
2036,5.0,"Management can be a bit obsessive with metrics, changing how they measure them almost on a weekly basis"
2037,5.0,None that I can think of

2052,5.0,Competitive environment. Need to work harder to get promoted.
2053,5.0,Work Overtime almost everyday and get paid a little
2054,1.0,"Ohana culture is really fading away because ASEAN Sales management is so number-driven and sales-focused. Sales culture is pretty toxic where you are pushed for numbers on a weekly, daily basis. Micro-management exists under some management but feedback are not welcome because they always pushed things back as your own problems. Had several burnouts in a months and they make you feel like a bad salesperson and lower self-confidence. Everybody in sales is looking for new opportunities and turnover rate has been crazy because of recent management changes."
2055,5.0,We cannot ask for surveys to the customers for which spiff amount is provided.

2064,5.0,Emphasis on San Francisco headquarters
2065,4.0,"Sometimes you feel like you are on your own, and have to figure things out. Not a lot of 1:1 development, you have to feel out what you want from your manager Not always sure I am ""on the right track"" The pace of change is fast, especially with acquisitions It's not a great job for anyone who needs constant reassurance, you will do best if you are a go-getter and can network on your own with your teams. Hours can be long depending on the time of year for customers"
2066,4.0,Red tape and more cautious to action than some of the other tech companies.
2067,5.0,Typical big company with soiled organization.
2068,5.0,Complex sales cycle and a lot of products to sell - which is why working here is like a sales MBA

2075,4.0,Always busy but difficult to get things dones
2076,4.0,projects you are working on can get to redundant after some time
2077,5.0,"There is a lot of pride in Salesforce's culture, which can often feel a bit cult-like. I joined Salesforce through an acquisition, and the leaders at the acquired company seemed much more used to tough questions than leaders that I observed at Salesforce. There's also a lot of internal training stuff through their internal trailhead platform that seems more time-consuming and less value-packed compared to other companies I've worked at."
2078,5.0,"Very few, can't think of a specific at the moment."
2079,5.0,"not too much cons, too much meetings?"

2085,4.0,the managers and staff at the location
2086,5.0,Not many I can point out
2087,5.0,Competitive landscape. Hard to get a promotion
2088,5.0,Can not think of anything bad
2089,4.0,"- priorities and strategy can swing from one month to the next - due to size of organization, needs political savvy to navigate - rah rah culture which values self-promotion to get visibility needed for career advancement"
2090,4.0,Hard to get promoted. Leadership is hard to read.
2091,5.0,"Remote working is challenging however, company is seeking to reopen safely"

2093,5.0,slower tech development and release cycles
2094,5.0,Lot of critical priorities in flight at the same time
2095,5.0,I have found no cons to date.
2096,2.0,"However, a lack of 1-1 training and mentorship."
2097,1.0,"Lacks organizational identity, can be ethically challenged"
2098,5.0,I have to put 5 words here.
2099,4.0,"Definitely a cutthroat environment, but you could probably say the same thing for any publicly traded company. Just something you need to be aware of going into it."
2100,5.0,"The work can be a bit repetitive. Salespeople are the ""stars of the show"" so sometimes you end up playing a vendor role more than a strategic thought partner / advisor role Not a ton of room for upward mobility"
2101,5.0,"Honestly no cons, this company is all it's cracked up to be"
2102,5.0,No bad things to say overall
2103,3.0,Pay is low and work boring
2104,5.0,Everything good in salesforce part
2105,5.0,competition often pays more than SFDC
2106,5.0,Don't have a bad thing to say
2107,5.0,things can get a bit political when it comes to promotions
2108,5.0,there are no cons yet
2109,4.0,"During my tenure, my territory changed 4 times in 20 months. It is hard to set up your sales team for success with the constant changes. The go to market strategy makes sense for our customers but internally its a cluster when the core is in charge of everything regarding the customer."
2110,3.0,"As the company has gotten bigger, roles have become more narrow. I had looked to move into another role for a while, but, as a director level, there weren't a lot of opportunities - Salesforce is hiring more and more junior people to fill roles. My position was eliminated and replaced by an analyst level person straight out of college. Many other higher level ( read- older, long-term employees) folks were part of the same layoff in 2020. You will have many different managers while you are there - I had 13 in 8 1/2 years. So, if you have a bad one, wait - they will move into something else. The bad part of this is its hard to make a mark when you constantly have to re-prove yourself. The company used to give raises every year - even just a cost of living raise. This stopped around 2017 or so. So negotiate your upfront salary well."
2111,5.0,Less mature in some areas compared to other companies given it’s age.
2112,5.0,"I was reassigned to a devops team, when I was expecting to be a SWE last minute."
2113,5.0,"I think there are things we can continue working on as a team and we already do, for example, making our applicant tracking system more efficient."
2114,5.0,Pace of work Constant change US-centric Otherwise Very few
2115,4.0,- political and bureaucratic - success is very luck-dependent
2116,5.0,Self Service company makes it tough for some folks with big egos.
2117,5.0,Evolves Fast Takes time to change
2118,5.0,BAD ENVIROMENT and the dont pay on time
2119,4.0,Working at a large company there are of course certain protocols and guidelines that have to be followed which can make it difficult to change processes/implement something new.
2120,5.0,- oddly political when it comes to promotions - sometimes you work late hours - sometimes harder to ask for more pay
2121,5.0,"Navigating the organization can be tricky, onboarding is subjective. IMO there's a lot of unnecessary information thrown at a new hire that doesn't matriculate to support an individual role and becomes overly complicated and time-consuming."
2122,5.0,big company and sometimes hard to navigate
2123,5.0,Sometimes I feel like upwards mobility isn’t there.
2124,1.0,"AEs change accounts each fiscal year - customers do not like this and could promote a ""im not going to make $ on this account"" mentality, very difficult to form long lasting relationships Healthcare vertical struggles with sales - I hardly got any commission checks Constant forecasting So much admin work each quarter and month"
2125,3.0,"Attempting to change from one cloud to another is next to impossible. Internal recruitment at the time did a 90% ghosting and the usual excuses of being ""overworked"" when it really was apparent that they had no interest in helping someone make a lateral move within the company to another cloud."
2126,3.0,"Policies and people don't always match up. The company is so large, there is no one to pick up the phone and ask a question to. Everything is knowledge article driven and often takes 5X longer to search and sometimes not find the correct answer. Frustration is daily with the size and how robotic a once caring company has become."
2127,3.0,Long hours and heavy quotas A lot of meetings and so much expectation around self improvement Not an easy place to navigate career wise if you come in thru sales Pay is low for tech Work life balance is a myth
2128,4.0,"- Intense & competitive, at times - Strong imbalance of workload across employees - Sales-driven culture"
2129,3.0,"The Security organization (Security Assurance specifically) is going through an identity crisis with a hazy long term vision to support a changing engineering org. Without a clear vision and direction, the focus is on fire fighting and operational day-to-day tasks. The culture never recovered from the DefCon/Meat Pistol incident and leadership turnover. Lately, there seems to be high turnover in more senior Security Assurance engineers due to slowed career growth, increasing workload, and less competitive compensation."
2130,5.0,Support gets less benefits than other departments which leads to some unhappiness.
2131,5.0,"MuleSoft can be a difficult team to hire for as they're extremely selective with who they bring on, so you must be able to push back on hiring teams to level set expectations."
2132,3.0,"Big disconnect from management especially at the higher levels, information is slow to disseminate, problematic change management"
2133,4.0,"Upper management are sales people and they try to manage the technical teams like sales, doesn't work well."
2134,5.0,"I was reassigned to a devops team, when I was expecting to be a SWE last minute."
2135,5.0,- Direction from a lot of different teams leads to a lot of chasing - Big company energy
2136,5.0,None I can think of.
2137,5.0,-company is growing so fast that it’s getting harder to be nimble
2138,5.0,I have to put 5 words here.
2139,2.0,- micro management - unhealthy work environment - much of what's touted about a great work environment does not funnel down to sites away from HQ - mid-level mgmt creates a toxic culture that is very stressful & unhealthy
2140,5.0,Just joined none so far
2141,3.0,"- Training is terrible. They throw you into the territory and don't even cover products since ""you don't need to know what they are"". - Zero work/life balance. You'll get mental health days but that's after you've been working 9 hours a day and don't even get to log overtime for it. If you want space, you have to set it and hold to it. - Less than 30% of reps hit their quota and making money is more about lucky timing with SPIFFs than it is skill."
2142,5.0,Lot of critical priorities in flight at the same time
2143,5.0,Promotion doesn’t come with such a great raise so it’s a bummer
2144,5.0,This is a high growth industry and the company is growing at double digits; be prepared to deal with stress that comes with working for best in class organizations.
2145,4.0,"Long hours, demanding, competitive/can be difficult to get promoted"
2146,4.0,Starting to have an overburden of internal processes that get in the way of job productivity.
2147,5.0,"Rigid structure, promotion cycle / timeline"
2148,2.0,"There are reviews here with 0 cons which I find hard to believe for a 60K employee company. They jam public surveys down our throats to get the image of the ""Best place to work."" Seems like HR is rushing to drown out poor reviews.... Salesforce is an okay place with some very, very toxic people. I've met one of the worst human beings of my life here, and with how the world is in 2021, that's saying a lot. First-line leaders are more often bad than good. Back office draws territories randomly every year, and leaders have very little say, so it's the luck of the draw. Under 20% of reps hit quota and meet their OTE for a company already underpaying due to their name. You need to hit quota to get paid a reasonable amount which only happens once maybe twice a year if you're lucky. Managers won't acknowledge that you have a bad territory and have the same expectations as the leading rep. Leading rep makes 3 to 4 times the amount of everyone else and is put on a pedestal but everyone including themselves knows it's the opportunity given. Accounts change every year, so prospecting is demotivating, knowing the work you do will go to someone else. Essentially an order taker with not enough orders to hit quota. Very saturated market. Inundated with pointless nonrevenue generating admin work/meetings. Inundated is an understatement. The majority of the information logged within the CRM is fake due to the pressure to meet all of the initiatives and stay off the naughty list. Leading to inaccurate reporting which leads to increased expectations. You will be drowning, gasping for air as your first-line leaders stand on your shoulders with their heads out of the water... for the most part. If you can tread water for 2+ years, you will get the Salesforce stamp of approval on your resume to find a better, higher-paying job. 2-3 year turnover is drastic. HARD WORK DOES NOT GET YOU AHEAD. Your mental health and wellbeing will deteriorate. Please do your research and reach out to folks working there to get their opinions."
2149,4.0,It's a bit slower paced
2150,4.0,Im so grateful with that.
2151,3.0,Lots and lots of stress Micromanagement environment You will feel drained as an SDR
2152,4.0,Sometimes there is an overhead in communication. Total compensation could be better. Talented engineers often leave the company for better compensation.
2153,4.0,Salary isn't competitive compared to other large companies
2154,3.0,"Place has become slow, anything new has a lot of cross-team bureaucratic red tapism to jump . by time you jump it will be years. Agile is good if things are done when its needed . At time by time things start the need has changed ."
2155,5.0,No down sides as such. Cant think of any. One could be no stock refreshers
2156,5.0,Lots of internal meetings/admin work
2157,5.0,"Sometimes it’s too large and I miss a smaller company feel. Ive not met most of my team in person because we are all remote. We do video meeting, but it would be nice to meet them in person."
2158,4.0,"As with any large company, bureaucracy can become an issue."
2159,4.0,Territories have become so small that it's hard to hit quota consistently throughout the year.
2160,5.0,Stock rewards are not quite up to competitors. Multiple acquisitions make stock prices rocky and unpredictable. Criticisms are relatively minor compared to other places I've worked.
2161,5.0,Can’t really think of one
2162,3.0,"1. Being a female over 40 is dangerous unless you are deemed traditionally attractive and in a submissive role. Despite all the lip service to “equality” the idea of it within the workplace culture is selective an applies only to those who cow and obey the party line. 2. Salesforce puts the CULT in CULTure. There’s an underlying expectation that Salesforce should fulfill every part of your being. From spiritual, “join this mumbo jumbo mindfulness session lead by some trendy junk shaman” to the political that seems to only represent one side of an issue. 3."
2163,4.0,"1- I was surprised by how much politics are brought up, mentioned or discussed. It is very obvious the leadership has liberal/democratic believes and so do many of the employees. I personally like to avoid discussing politics so I find it really uncomfortable. 2- It’s such a big organization that it takes a while to understand how it is structured and your career path options. 3- The Management layer seems to be there to check a box and doesn’t seem to really be trained or given the tools to train and develop their team. I report to someone that does a different role than mine and every time I ask a question related to my role they refer me to a peer in my role cause they don’t know the answer."
2164,5.0,very busy fast paced but people are supportive and sympathetic
2165,2.0,"Sales and marketing definitely run the show and engineers are at the bottom of everything. This issues hits budgets, prioritization, morale, and recruiting. Engineers should just get use to being 2nd class citizens."
2166,5.0,"not too much cons, too much meetings?"
2167,5.0,"BDR is a grind. Metrics increase YOY, with every little thing being measured there is always something to improve upon. Sometimes it feels like you're just a cog in this massive machine, but that's the sacrifice you have to take to get into a company as amazing as Salesforce"
2168,5.0,"Staying organized is a bit of a challenge but that is on me to figure out. With so much work and so many people to interact with, it is very tough to keep everything organized and straight. The tools are there, I just need to master them."
2169,4.0,Very high metrics to hit and a lot of people management
2170,4.0,- bad equity refreshers - large company
2171,5.0,"maybe for some too americanized culture, see very friend-like, intimate manager relationships, in sales a bit contradictory culture at times: extra PTO while target remains the same"
2172,5.0,"Very fast paced, not really a con but for some it might be Lot of activities that you must do just to check a box and be a good corporate citizen Difficult Onboarding for new hires, drinking from a firehouse is an understatement"
2173,5.0,Nothing really relevant to say.
2174,4.0,"Lots of duplication, shadow orgs, hard to get work done."
2175,3.0,Serious lack of leadership in the org that I work in. It's as though no one knows our value and what we should be doing. Long stretches of boredom punctuated by intermittent moments of sheer terror trying to fight fires or make ridiculous deadlines.
2176,3.0,"Too much work, not enough downtime"
2177,5.0,i think some of the mascots are less cute than others
2178,2.0,"Finance department has some growing pains. Pretty sub-par culture with a bug lack of management on work load, project management, and more. Work-life balance out the window here. A big piece of the org is great, but there's some employees who haven't figured out a good management style to the detriment of the team"
2179,5.0,Tough sales process and can be long sales cycles. Managers are tough on forecast I think that is about it
2180,5.0,getting addicted to such lovely culture is also not great thing. wish every company treats their employees the way Salesforce does!!
2181,5.0,I really don't have anything but good things to say about the company
2182,5.0,- lightening fast company - on call all the time
2183,5.0,Limited growth opportunities at executive level in Indiana (which is considered a cheap backwater)
2184,2.0,"Not customer focused. Timelines to get deals done, constantly changing the contacts clients would work with, terrible inter office communication leadership at the VP and RVP level is really just other sales people looking to make quota and not lead anything."
2185,3.0,Unfair pay for minorities and women
2186,3.0,"The company culture is all about sales sales sales. It's a good place for people in sales, but it can be a culture clash for people on the tech side of the house."
2187,5.0,"With some 60,000 employees, my opinions are just what I see and experience in my little piece of Salesforce. Different areas of Salesforce may have different management styles."
2188,5.0,"Transparency sometimes feels like an issue. Despite the frequent all-hands calls, there is sometimes confusion around the direction of certain products/branches"
2189,5.0,Since its rapid growth there seems to be some red tape forming. Some of it likely to Covid. I am hourly and can no longer just submit overtime freely. It seems harder for someone right out of school to advance with all of the outside hires coming in.
2190,5.0,Benefit and compensation are not that competitive compared with other bay area technology companies. No meal and sneak is limited.
2191,5.0,"Long hours, very aggressive goals and some competition without collaboration. In person stuff is the only meaningful way to grown and connect."
2192,3.0,"The company spends more time marketing Equality externally than actually behaving with that value in mind. They do not publicize retention. Microaggressions, bias, and unequal pay are still issues. Zero accountability, even from teams tasked to lead this work. From a technical standpoint, it can be easy to pigeonhole yourself into their proprietary stack such that those skills are less marketable outside of the Salesforce community. If you want to work on more modern, industry-standard frameworks outside of Salesforce one day, this may not be the company for you."
2193,5.0,Can be under a lot of stress at times if you work in marketing
2194,4.0,The process followed for promotion is inconsistent and there is a significant title inflation
2195,4.0,"-Hiring like crazy, ripping up and distributing territories unevenly -Same folk make all the money/tenured reps get the largest and best territories -Mgmt is somewhat out of touch with reality"
2196,4.0,"feast or famine too many products/co-primes (could also be a pro, lots of ways to make money) culture is very team/org-dependent but in general its competitive and everyone is just trying to seem impressive all the time"
2197,4.0,Can be super stressful and demanding place to be at. Management can be a bit wishy washy at times and micromanage. Very easy to get lost in this large of a companyt
2198,5.0,"Remote onboarding is a little impersonal. Not much to be done in these times, but you lose the sense of community with remote onboarding."
2199,4.0,"Sometimes you feel like just a number, very limited in the account to receive which limits your ability to use all of your talents."
2200,1.0,"If you want to get hoodwinked into a company that prides itself on employees first and good values, then have at it. After making other companies pledge to not lay off anyone during the pandemic, they proceeded to lay off thousands of employees 3 months (one quarter) into the shutdowns. Oh wait, the pledge the CEO said was “no Covid related layoffs………. For 90 days”. Everyone here is addicted to “building their brand” as best they can, as if their lives in this company are all about building a vain social media account that “looks” good to everyone else."
2201,5.0,A growing successful company = Fast-Paced Change is truly a reality; Just a matter of when things will unfold Encouraged to take vacation or wellness days but hard to find the perfect time of year (if not careful burnout is a real possibility)
2202,5.0,no bonuses and didn't allow for other hobbies to be pursued outside of work. more supervision
2203,5.0,NeedFaster cycle time and take more risks
2204,5.0,one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven
2205,5.0,Equity could be better on a continual yearly basis. Management is focusing on the right things now
2206,5.0,None that I know of
2207,5.0,"Constant pressure to win new business every month. I understand that is the name of the game in sales. But we put customer relationships at-risk in the long-term because we are constantly asking them to upgrade or buy something more ""now"" instead of on their timeline.

2237,5.0,"It's a big organization and it's very easy to get lost You have got to do extra-credit to become noticed (ERG leadership roles, work around the clock, raise your hand for extra work, etc.) You have got to own your career without a shout of doubt; no one is responsible for your success but you.

2240,4.0,"The hours can be tough and the pace of work is ridiculous. The job will suck your soul if you are lower level, but seems much better once you move up the ranks. In order to be the best, you must do the most and work the hardest; not necessarily be the smartest. Initiatives like 'well-being' mandatory days off 1 time per month make life worse not better.

Every single decent feature is acquired. The company has spend $50B to acquire $3B in recurring revenue, should tell you something - Organizational mess - every few days they will acquire someone and the whole organization will be spun upside down with some new message from Marc - Most narcis"

2274,2.0,"1) When starting out they will give you the worst patch to see if you can turn dry lemons into lemonade. As you get more tenured you may or may not receive a better patch, it depends on how you want to navigate the favoritism game. The more popular you are with leadership, the better the accounts and the more flips you will get. 2) To be successful it's all about the 3 T's: Territory, Timing, and Talent in exactly that order. If your accounts aren't growing, you will have a very difficult year ahead living on base salary alone which is already way lower than market. Be prepared to spin your wheels which can often feel like high effort low return as CRM decisions don't happen overnight. 3) Every start of the fiscal accounts are shifted around which can be frustrating both internally and externally. The revolving door of AEs makes it hard to establish long term trust with customers. 4) Be prepared to invest a lot of time fixing CSAT issues from poor implementation left behind from the rep before you. 5) The majority of ACV is made in Q4 which is around year-end holidays, making it stressful to take time off."
2275,5.0,- Slow pace as is the nature of enterprise technology - Internal developer tools could use some work - High-caliber intern and new grad class can often feel competitive - New grad program events and mentorship isn't as great as the intern experience (which is stellar)

Offices in SF are nice but they’re still just offices, with the same layout on every floor and few areas for having quiet or privacy. They are working on diversity, but the higher up you go the more white and make it is."
2282,5.0,None. Literally no cons exists from my point of view

2284,3.0,Lot of politics. Lot of confusion. Nothing straightforward. Lot of running around and processes.
2285,4.0,"Fast paced, sometimes work can get stressful"
2286,4.0,- Increasing growth of middle management and more executive leaders without clear roles/responsibilities. - Many teams do the same thing under different names. It's confusing how many teams you need to work with to get something simple accomplished. - Inconsistent leadership - some leaders focus more time on managing-up versus ensuring their people are successful. I've had amazing leaders and mentors but also horrible leaders who marginalize their people. - No clear path for IC career growth. Salesforce gets very political with people garnering for expanded responsibility and headcount - not focused on performance.

Also, if your manager has been there for many years, there is almost zero chance that they are going to fire a bad manager even if you discuss issues with HR. You are basically one of a number. They do not care how you did in the past"
2291,5.0,GREAT experience AND GREAR PEOPLE
2292,5.0,Can sometimes be frustrating as you have no one specific to talk to at times on a day-to-day basis. You have to quickly find your cohorts who are in the same stage of your journey.

2300,4.0,A recent increase in metrics seems unsustainable
2301,5.0,"- ""Big Business"" hiring and promotion policies may limit your growth potential (you can't skip pay grades while working at SFDC) - In order to affect change, you either need to be in the right role or have resources that are in those roles who are accountable to you. For example, if you have been asked to implement a system improvement, it's going to take months or years because of all the interplay between departments. - I found myself doing a lot of ticket filing so someone else could do work that I could do myself, simply because that's the way the systems and access levels were set up."

2307,3.0,"Cliques, say one thing and do another, no career growth/development, ""positive"" culture except behind closed doors, not very innovative because there are too many layers of approval and yes people, very reactive versus strategic, the PMM org is really all about who you know and telling leadership what they want to hear (literally every quarter the great leader survey shows the disconnect between the worker bees and the leadership, but nothing changes even when they make you attend ""feel good"" meetings about wanting to hear what they can do differently). P.S. I'd recommend to a friend with strong caveats."

2320,3.0,"The cliques & “mean-girl” environment (regardless of gender), the ageism - disproportionately very few older employees, the barrage of acquisitions & length of time to absorb them, the hierarchical nature, keeping up with the historical double digit growth rate is continuously getting harder as the company has grown — the pressure to maintain this is very high & the burnout is real"
2321,5.0,No cons on anything really
2322,5.0,"- upward mobility and interview process is political - salary is low compared to competitors - very low* - managers and leaders are viewed like royals - very competitive job transitions - it's a machine - managers are focused on numbers first, then everything else"
2323,2.0,"Your Account Executives control your destiny. I came in as an outside hire for the first 4 months in the role my Account Executives had no time for me to learn about their accounts, what their goals were and wouldn't let me into their key accounts to help set meetings. This affects my KPI's and was expected to perform with little to no direction. It's radio silent in my 1:1s and was asked to come up with points of view into their new logo accounts. They don't utilize their BDRs correctly and believe were supposed to research all of their new logo accounts and come in with a step by step plan. How am I supposed to do this with no knowledge or direction on any of the products or goals? I've been told by other reps that you have to internally sell you AE's on why things should be opportunities. It's very gamey and if you don't know how to play it...you're in for a rough ride."
2324,2.0,"The push for productivity on top of enormous amount of learning material pushed on people here is unrealistic and stress inducing. During the pandemic more work was given than less. Getting a promotion requires you to push numbers rather than do work that benefits the team. All of the number fibbers and cherry pickers are the ones getting the back rubs here. Work/life balance is not respected all that much. It's stated that you should strive for a work/life balance, but the amount of work given does not allow it, and you'll usually find yourself frantically looking for extra time to fulfill work that's been unrealistically dumped on you. KPIs are unrealistic given the extension of some issues that customers raise. Upper management makes quick uneducated changes that usually goes against what everyone in the org would recommend, but they do it anyways."
2325,2.0,Do a quick search of Salesforce marketing spend compared to other big tech companies and you’ll see why working here is such highly touted. The company has shown its true colors during the covid pandemic. Impossible quotas as is with no quota relief during pandemic. BDRs are measured by how much Monopoly money they put into Salesforce and how buddy buddy they are with their AEs. The company says one thing to the press but treats its employees a completely different way. I have not felt any instance of “Ohana” since being here even though I was super excited to work for Salesforce. BDRs feel as if it’s them against the world at this company and have to deal with AE ego on a consistent basis.

2345,5.0,"Office culture, but COVID has proved (and I hope), that it may be possible to work remotely effectively."

2350,5.0,I dont have anything negative at this point
2351,1.0,"During my time here, I've witnessed countless examples of discrimination and inappropriate comments from management, specifically my manager. This behavior is accepted. Salesforce is not a company that welcomes open, honest dialogue and feedback. If you disagree with management in any way, expect retaliation. There are people in management positions who have no business being there. When you have questionable leadership, it causes many issues and problems that go unnoticed. In my case, I was subjected to report to someone who lacks the basic qualities a good manager must have: empathy, understanding, active listening, patience, strong communication, transparency, and loyalty to your team. Don't expect any of those qualities in many of the managers at Salesforce. The managers here continue to ""kick down and kiss up"" to get to where they are today. My manager lacked maturity, basic professionalism, and self-awareness . He has said some derogatory things about women, made incredibly inappropriate comments on team calls, and speaks to some of the females on his team in such a brash, disrespectful manner. It did not help that the person he reported to, the next manager in the line of management, was inherently cold and disconnected. I have never seen such self-serving managers in my professional career. The recruiting managers and leaders will never have your back. Example: If a candidate feels as though he/she should have gotten a job they interviewed for and chooses to retaliate against the recruiter ( example: write a bad Glassdoor review and name you), recruiting leadership will reach to place blame on the recruiter. Bad Glassdoor review = bad for the brand and the ""brand"" is #1 priority at Salesforce. EVERYTHING that is done at this company is done as an effort to strengthen their brand. It's all for show. All they care about is being perceived as ""a company that cares"" with an ""Ohana"" culture, when in reality, it is all about optics and concealing an incredibly abusive, toxic culture. Be prepared to also have a manager that takes credit for your success. You did well because they ""set you up for it"" and ""coached you."" (During my entire time there, I have never learned anything valuable from my first line manager - with the exception of what kind of manager I will not be one day) Recruiting here is a factory. It's all about pumping out hires quarter after quarter and hitting an arbitrary hiring number at any expense, even if you have to bend the rules a bit. Example: having people have start dates when they're still employed at their current employer, pressuring sales candidates to start immediately without giving a notice period to their current employers and using manipulative tactics like saying ""If they really want this job, they will make it happen""...etc. Salesforce hires most - if not all - recruiters on contract first. They reassure you that the contract thing is just a Salesforce formality and should you be a perform well, you will be converted in a year or less. I saw first-hand a couple of very high-performing recruiters get let go simply because they refused to play the ridiculous political game that is expected of you. Recruiting here is a rat race and lacks any nuance or creativity. As a recruiter, you do not have a voice or opinion. You are a sheep in the herd following the leaders. The ""leaders"" only care about branding, how the company is perceived, and how they themselves look to their leaders. They care very little about the actual recruiters doing the work. Recruiters are at the very bottom of the totem pole. If you hint at any disscontempt with your role, team, manager, company - you will be shunned. I can't speak for all of the recruiting teams and the entire company, but this is my honest feedback about Sales Recruiting at Salesforce. I wanted to provide honest feedback to future candidates who are considering leaving full-time roles for this often unpleasant role. If you choose to, use this as a resume booster if you're trying to break into the tech industry and then get out. Understand that the behavior you will witness there and the treatment you will likely receive is not okay. This is not how respectable companies operate. There are so many better opportunities at other SaaS companies where you will be treated with dignity and respect."

2356,5.0,Large corporate company and hard to individualize plans for employees
2357,4.0,Onboarding experience needs improvement although I didn’t get the chance to attend in person boot camps.

2358,5.0,"Competitive work environment that pushes you to do your best, but sometimes a few people can cut corners which creates an unfair and skeptical atmosphere"
2359,4.0,Work/life balance sadly out of whack. Some management resort to more stick than carrot to get short term bump in performance. Sometimes asked to sacrifice long term relationship with customer in exchange for small short term revenue.

The company is also very short sighted. You might be a rockstar one year but next year they will make you feel like belittled. Your success in the organization will depend on what territory/patch you will be aligned to. Many people join Salesforce for the name, but be careful. Sometimes its not worth joining a company just because they have a brand name."

2369,4.0,contractors are given the responsibilities of full-time employees and sometimes stay in roles for YEARS but they are not given any of the benefits of full time employees. there is lots of redundancy in people's jobs - feels like i meet a new person every other day that has the same role as me yet we don't collaborate on projects. left arm doesn't know what the right arm is doing at times. teams and reporting relationships are illogical and disorganized because people get promoted without regard for how it disrupts the bigger picture. the pace of things is sometimes way too fast - it is helpful to stop and smell the roses and slow down a bit rather than plow full speed ahead just for the sake of innovation. and the company can be a little cult-like and self-important. lots of emphasis is focused on public speaking and flashy slide decks and celebrity. the beauty of a slide deck and a well-written speech is sometimes valued more than the quality of the work.
2370,5.0,none that I can think of at this time
2371,3.0,"""Diversity"" - There's a good lip service but, the reality is that upper management is mostly white. Until there is massive change in how recruiting and cultivating talent happens in the tech industry white guys are going to begat more white guys. Chances are pretty good they don't have friends or connections who are POC. This also holds true from people who come from other tech companies. When rats jump the ship they tend to bring other rats with them. Not so subtle hints that you have to hold a ""right"" set of beliefs/values - you have to get onboard or made to feel like an outsider. If you question or don't hold a certain The idea that Salesforce can save the human race - Salesforce is an innovative tech company with products and services that help customers do business. Be that! While SF is the biggest and holds a huge marketshare, it has created this idea that it can somehow save the world. Surrounded by lots of people who don't actually work with you - there are some teams that have a larger representation in certain hubs but, if you have a team that is largely based in one hub it can get lonely being surrounded by people who are largely irrelevant to your daily work life. It can also infringe on W/L balance. Ohana seating - Gross. Everyone needs their own desk and space. ""Data Driven"" - Sometimes translates to manipulating for personal gain and benefit."

2398,2.0,"Your experience here will completely depend on your direct manager and reporting line - and that's a very mixed bag of people. There is a lot of ego at play in some leaders and a total lack of EQ/empathy - be sure to interview your manager through the hiring process. There is nothing as demotivating as a sales manager who doesn't have basic leadership skills or self awareness. They have over hired Account Executives as they believe that this will drive limitless growth in the region. Result being that everyone has territories that are too small to give them a reasonable chance at succeeding. Attainment is poor even from those who have been with the business a number of years and have been successful in their previous roles. This DOESN'T stop huge amounts of pressure being placed on each individual to hit pipe gen and sales targets (even during COVID). Very few people have hit their quota or anywhere near it in the last few years. 5-7 years ago this probably would have been a great place to work but it has changed considerably since then. People don't trust the anonymous feedback surveys so the business doesn't understand the huge amount of grumbling that is happening behind the scenes. AEs are unhappy and many are looking elsewhere. But management also does its best to make you fearful about leaving in order to keep you in place to avoid more turnover. They made most of their customer success group redundant last year. Aside from COVID, there seems to be a major aversion to letting people work from home which to me highlights that there is a lack of trust in their people. Some management speak down to their team like they are children. Very few female leaders in the sales team - not sure the organisation is honestly asking themselves why this is? People talk the talk about diversity because it's a SFDC value but that's not necessarily how they really think or execute. I don't even think most of them are capable of thinking outside their own experience."

2409,1.0,"I’ve only been with the company for a few months, and it was my dream company to work for. I fell for the hype, the branding, the “perks”, the “culture”, the philanthropy. Now, I can speak from experience that the culture is fake. Benioff might mean well and the company might provide perks so that from those on the outside looking in, this is a great place to work. I just know that during the months I’ve been here, I haven’t had any time to see the Salesforce park or have coffee in the Ohana floor. I’m on a small team and other than my manager, the others have not said 3 words to me, unless I’m talking to them in a group setting. No “how was your day?” Or “Do you want me to show you around?” How’s that for culture? I tried to walk to a meeting with a team member and she completely ignored me. I’ve never felt so lonely at a job. The Ohana seating makes it impossible to get to know anyone. I am so busy from the moment I get in but accomplish nothing. We have so many meetings... meetings 85% of my days to talk about nothing that can’t get accomplished through emails. Or the meeting is about the same things we just met about 2 hours ago. The culture is not about being productive or getting things done. It’s about looking/feeling like important topics are being discussed, sitting in conference rooms, and over complicating the strategy. We just spin and spin and then we go home, and do it again the next day. Every single thing I’ve worked on since I started have been scratched or changed because the process or overall strategy has changed. How does anyone work around here or get anything done in this type of setting and without concrete decisions being made? The on-boarding is very chaotic and management isn’t aligned with the actual on-boarding process. They don’t factor in how long the mandatory trailhead courses take or take the time to onboard you. Becoming Salesforce and Bootcamps are just thrown into the schedule and are disruptive to the day-to-day workflow. (I’ve had to reschedule because there are other meetings that conflict). I met someone, also new but on another team, who complained she doesn’t have time for bootcamp. Maybe it’s not necessary? Just show the new employees how to navigate the elevators in the tower... this took me weeks to figure out on my own."
2410,2.0,"There was no transparency in how promotions were decided and very little feedback to help get you to the next level. Employee Success is a joke at this company. It was total chaos trying to get anything done with way too many cooks in the kitchen. If you're an older employee, don't expect any of your previous work experience to mean anything. If it didn't happen at Salesforce, it didn't happen at all. Compensation is definitely lower than the other big tech firms in San Francisco. Stop using so Hawaiian jargon and ridiculous costume characters. It's a business, not a pre-school. No stock refresh for grade 7's in ES, even though we were eligible under the plan."

Behind the smoke and mirrors, there are lots of product issues, career planning is non-exsistent, former Oracle leaders continue to foster a toxic culture. Marc B is too busy with other priorities and his celebrity lifestyle, that he is disconnected with what is happening on the ground with the culture and customers. This year's planning and re-organization were short-sighted and poorly executed. Executives very focused on short term results and lacking in long term strategic focus. It is a house of cards financially and constant fiscal engineering to prop up the numbers for the street. Sales and marketing lack any fiscal restraint-- spend money like drunken sailors.

Put too many people like this together and you run the risk of creating a toxic, impatient, self-interested culture. Sr. Management is pretty disconnected with what actually goes on the ground. Middle management is huge popularity contest. What bugged me this most is the preaching of diversity and inclusion, yet they constantly hire and promote a very disproportionate WHITE staff in their Sales org. Particularly evident in their Central teams. Very very few minority leaders and individual contributors are actually hired, retained, groomed for success, and promoted. It's almost as if they hire diversity to check a box for their board and shareholders? At the end of the day, yes, the best producers are rewarded, but if you're going to promote such values, at least walk the walk, because the company can definitely afford it."

2435,4.0,"My role (and other roles in my part of the organization) became very specialized over time, which I assume to was to help with efficiency in client work. But it also meant that I was doing a lot of the same tasks over and over again. I found there was little opportunity to branch out to take on responsibilities of other roles or to learn another role. I knew several people who left Salesforce because they became frustrated at their lack of advancement. People in my role also had a billable utilization goal of 36 hours a week. If you did not have that much time billable, it was seen as an issue. But you are not always in charge of how much work you had or what work was available. Which is true of many businesses, I know. Also, if you wanted to take time off, you needed to find a backup (or multiple backups) to take on your account work while you are out. Which can be difficult if everyone is trying to work 36 billable hours a week. And you had to train them if they had never worked on your account before. So taking time off was a chore, at least for my role. I ended up taking only maybe 2 weeks off during a year. I regularly hit my cap of 300 PTO hours and stopped accumulating PTO. And the billable utilization goal was pushed so much that they started tying it to the quarterly bonuses. In the end, it didn't end up meaning much because my role was eliminated even though at the time I was regularly billing 36+ hours a week. Ultimately, I would preach to not drink the Kool Aid. They preach that everyone that works there is part of the ""Ohana"" and is family but don't buy it. This is probably not new to a lot of you, but it's just marketing. They are a business first. They don't really care about you. You have to look out for yourself first and foremost. If you start buying into it even just a little bit, that's when you don't take as much time off as you should or don't take your full 6 months of paternity leave out of some sense of obligation to the ""Ohana."" Take advantage of everything they give you down to the last PTO hour because they will happily discard you without hesitation when they don't see value in you as an ""Ohana"" member any longer. If you feel stagnant in your role, use your free work time to help yourself or get out of there because they will not help you take another role."

2439,3.0,"Terrible management from the top. Leaders don’t care about their teams, they care about promotion and power. Leaders come from different companies with the intention to gain more visibility and status at salesforce. The company has been like that since 2018. People are not recognized by their hard work. People are recognized and promoted by their “marketing” values ( increase salesforce portfolio in the media, increase number of customers, increase status of Marc B, etc) . Leaders can be bullies and discriminate without any type of punishment.

I called to ask for clarification and the offer was immediately pulled - less than 48 hours after it was extended -- as a direct consequence of ""asking questions"". Bizarre, appalling, and entirely illegal (pressuring a candidate to sign under duress, breach of contract, etc) and unethical practice. Be prepared with a good lawyer if you want to work here.

SE's are not paid commission for the quarter if they leave during the quarter. No pro-rated pay. Nothing. You just lose it. Only place I've worked where you give two weeks notice, they agree you can leave after a week because there is not reason to keep you aboard for the full two weeks, and they don't pay you the full two weeks. While employed, the culture felt caring and inclusive, and not like a big company . When you're ready to leave, you get treated like it's a big company where you are just a number."

2460,1.0,"Coming to Salesforce I made about 30k less than my last job and moved to a city that cost twice as much. Very few hit quota and they will not discuss the possibly of it being a lack of opportunity in the territory. As for the culture...it's not just that there's an extreme lack of diversity but also how they treat their few minorities. I've met so many people across the company in San Francisco, Toronto, Atlanta, Chicago, Denver, Boston, New York, and Dallas. Black employees everywhere have had a bad experience here. It's really changed me mentally. I'm a very sociable person but since I came to Salesforce I've been very isolated. Yes, I've spoken with our HR but even black employees that worked in HR have said they have the same gaslighting experience. It's sad because I can tell that the majority (not all but those I've reached out to for help) aren't interested in change but they continue to push their values on ""equality"". It's extremely triggering."

2490,2.0,"This used to be my dream job, I loved telling everyone I worked here and how awesome it was. Then as time went on, I realized it was all fake. The marketing team makes you believe that everything is perfect even when it's not. There is no way to move up even though people say you can. You will be promised one thing then later told the opposite. To move to a different role internally you have to move to a position of the same level or below, you cannot go up (called diagonally) in another department. Even if you make it happen, they keep you at the same pay and level for 6+ months so you will do more work for the same pay. There is NO INCENTIVE TO STAY!! I have known so many people who leave for this reason, then come back a year or so later 3-6 grades higher with better pay and benefits. Recruiters love that because they say it shows how great the company is that people come back, they could have saved themselves time and money by just promoting or transferring the person to the place they wanted to be at. My manager left after a few years and then they hired someone externally who had NO MANAGEMENT EXPERIENCE EVER!!! He was the worst manager I have ever had by far, he was rude, disrespectful, sexist, inappropriate, and completely useless. I was appalled at the way he treated his employees and when I brought it up to HR they basically said I couldn't prove it. Then other employees from a completely different department witnessed him scream at people and they went to HR and still the case was closed because ""lack of evidence"". Several employees were asked to work overtime without pay which is illegal for hourly employees. When I told my bosses boss that I was leaving, they offered me a promotion, but I would have had to move cross-country, and I was told there was no budget for moving costs, so I would pay them all on my own. As for salary, since it was a ""cheaper cost of living"" that there would be no increase. I laughed at this insulting offer to work more, have more responsibility and no increase in money while moving cross country. I declined the offer and they were somehow shocked. I left and never looked back, I am so much happier now that I left."

2493,2.0,Feast or famine with quota attainment (less than 20% attainment on a team). Everything is based on your territory and Manager.

2494,2.0,"It does not pay to have integrity at this company. You'll do well if you can smile and say ""everything is fine"" while the building you're in is actively burning to the ground. I was sent on multiple interviews for a position within the company in a department that I wanted to transfer to before being told they would not actually hire me and were just sending me on the interviews for reasons completely unknown to me. To be clear, there was a hiring freeze already in place and they STILL wanted me to interview more with no actual plan to hire/transfer me. The ""Family First"" policy is garbage. They said this motto about a million times when I worked there. When I needed it so I could care for my family member (My fiancee needed major back surgery), I was told this would not be a problem, was later told this was a major problem and she wasn't family, and then, after we got married, no one checked to see what I said about us being married was true. To be clear, Salesforce wanted to tell me who could be my family but then didn't care if it was actually true in the end. I could have lied and had the wedding we actually wanted and had been planning, instead of rushing to get married at the courthouse so I could get the leave and she could get the surgery on schedule. There doesn't seem to be a strong decision-making process. I was sent on retreats I didn't need to go on to hang out with people I never saw or communicated with while I needed to be at home to handle important matters. I was told this trip was imperative and I couldn't miss it. When I got there, no one knew what the trip was for and it turned out to just be drinking and games and a pep rally or two. A complete waste of valuable time."

2507,5.0,"Due to significant growth and promotions, customers have began to complain about their Salesforce Team changing. I will say, this is not a Salesforce specific issue."
2508,5.0,"The company and its products and services can be a bit daunting to comprehend for new employees coming in from outside the data / IT world. Though the company does give a ""Salesforce 101"" presentation during orientation, it still takes some time (6+ months) to completely acclimate to the firm and its operations, process, way of work, etc."
2509,5.0,"Very large organization, can feel overwhelming"
2510,5.0,"I don't think there are any cons. It depends on your role and manager, people work from home, get the work done. So, there are no negatives to add."
2511,5.0,"Love our culture of inclusion and that we lead organizations in proactively looking for ways to hire, promote and engage under-represented groups. That said, we need to be careful our internal messaging doesn't cross the line of coming across as things other than performance and leadership potential dictate upward mobility and promotion."
2512,5.0,- Not on par with FANG comp
2513,4.0,"Manager get their friends to join and end up biased for them. No measured performance review, no actionable feedback. Promotions based on personal rapport"
2514,5.0,"Massive scale, can be hard to navigate internally, process and standardization varies widely"
2515,3.0,"Recruiting at Salesforce is all about favoritism and politics. Promotions are political and unfair. Leadership has been telling their people that they are working on a fair and unbiased promotion process for years, but there is no proof that any work has been done. Management can often make employees feel like they are replaceable. I hate to break it to them, but smart/talented recruiters do not find Salesforce Recruiting a compelling enough organization to work for. If leadership wants to retain people, they need to have productive conversations around succession planning and salary increases. Salesforce Recruiters and Sourcers severely underpaid. Recruiting leadership preaches about how Salesforce is ahead of the game with URM (under-represented minorities) recruiting. In reality, it is nothing but a numbers game for them. The more hires they make, the better they look in front of Marc Benioff. They've been so fixated on increasing the numbers, that they've completely forgotten the meaning/importance of having a diverse workplace. How about we change the narrative from ""we need to hit our URM numbers every quarter,"" to ""lets think about the importance of cognitive diversity and thought."""
2516,5.0,Minimal cons. Sometimes it's difficult to understand how large the Salesforce ecosystem because there is constantly so much growth and changes.
2517,5.0,This is the salary for a contract Recruiting Coordinator before getting converted over.
2518,5.0,"Content can be dry, not as exciting as other consumer products available today, team doesn't have the most cohesive feeling, people aren't really friends outside of work they go home immediately at 5."
2519,4.0,on-boarding process needs a overhaul and the psychological safety depends on team to team.
2520,3.0,"Good luck if you're a remote employee. Would love to see promotion statistics for women vs. men. If you're a white male, don't worry, you're good! You'll get hired at a higher level and promoted quickly. Blah, blah, blah equality....Promotions are arbitrary."
2521,5.0,The office is located in Reston.
2522,4.0,Big company with lots of processes
2523,4.0,"Growth, passive aggressive culture when trying to evolve change."
2524,5.0,Rapid growth can lead to some stated ideals to be realistically implemented.
2525,5.0,"There are really no cons. It's a fast-paced environment; however, everyone is willing to pitch in and help with questions or anything else you need."
2526,5.0,Work life balance can be tricky to manage but widely supported as it should be.
2527,5.0,Seating arrangements are not the best but they’re working on making it better for everyone
2528,5.0,There are no cons with regards to working here
2529,5.0,nothing I can think of
2530,3.0,lack of quota achievement Bad salaries to long term employees
2531,5.0,NONE!!! (I personally don't have any cons to add here)
2532,4.0,"I worry that the emphasis on sales growth overshadows our customers' success on the platform, and our ability to scale to ensure they realize the value. Some acquisitions have carved out weird enclaves of unaligned culture. While this hasn't really tanked anything yet, I just think that the larger corporate entity just doesn't know how to best maximize the value of some of the smaller to mid-sized acquisitions it's scooped up in recent years."
2533,4.0,- Tech stack is outdated depending on your skillsets - Promotion for engineers involves a lot more office politics than you'd expect
2534,3.0,Political work environment Poor leadership with no self awareness Low morale Preaches equal pay when pay across same levels/titles is extremely unequal Promotes unfit leaders Asks for honesty but doesn’t actually want to hear the truth/ won’t act on it
2535,5.0,"Not really a con as a thing to think about. Working in open seating can be tough when the office is busy for some people. There are a lot of private conference/focus rooms but most get grabbed quickly during peak times. That being said, culture is very flexible at working from home"
2536,5.0,"- Lack of full stack experience for developers, you do more configuration than building - Speed can slow down due to excessive stress on collaboration and alignment - Some legacy elements, that need cleanup, but nothing that one cannot handle given everything else in place"
2537,5.0,It can take a while before you absorb Salesforce way of doing things and are able to contribute.
2538,5.0,N/A N/A N/A N/A N/A
2539,5.0,People working there have a little to much of an ego
2540,5.0,- CSG leadership seems to be in constant flux - No sick day policy - Fast pace and high workload can make it difficult to keep up - HR is weak and spineless - Becoming more corporate - Can be a siloed organization
2541,4.0,"management, bureaucracy, hypocritical in Ethics/values messaging compared to overall reality"
2542,5.0,Its easy to get sucked in and have work/life balance be an issue
2543,5.0,Nothing at this point to share
2544,5.0,"None so far, a lot of training"
2545,4.0,- Inequity of pay - Inconsistent comp plans
2546,4.0,Can't think of any cons
2547,5.0,Large company with lots of politivs
2548,4.0,"Cutthroat sales floor, high visibility, no work-life balance, monthly quotas stressful, sell in Salesforce Way, very political"
2549,5.0,"Nothing comes to mind, keep up the great work."
2550,4.0,Management can be more transparent.
2551,4.0,"Good place to work, but too socially political. Sales org is a meat grinder."
2552,5.0,None I could think of.
2553,5.0,There are no cons here
2554,5.0,Sales is stressful but that’s anywhere. You’re hired for a reason so the expectation is you can execute and close business.
2555,5.0,- change is the only constant so you must be comfortable being uncomfortable
2556,5.0,none that comes to mind
2557,5.0,No problems great place to work
2558,3.0,"A very small percentage of account executives hit quota, most are assigned to accounts with little or no propensity to buy"
2559,5.0,"No cons really, but maybe building a tower in Hawaii wouldn't THAT bad of an idea ;)"
2560,5.0,"Very quick moving environment (acquisitions, team or product changes, realignments) . Not all teams operate at same level of expertise so managing co-prime and core relationships can be as difficult or more difficult as managing customer relationships. Although, likely true for any other enterprise software sales org."
2561,5.0,"If someone is hesitant to change and prefers a predictable 9-5 schedule, Salesforce may not be the best fit."
2562,5.0,"Intense at times. Silo breaking must go on. Process of getting approvals to push features is not basic. Context switching between projects, some shutdowns / restarts based on resources is pretty regular, at least in my org. SF Downtown location is challenging for some due to long commute, though shuttles are offered along 101 and other routes."
2563,5.0,Resourcing (tools/headcount) in light of increasing growth of the company.
2564,5.0,No cons that I can think of.
2565,3.0,"-Bro culture -uneven territory distribution -Constant shuffling of divisions -unattainable goals (most sales teams only had 1-2 people who hit goal out of 12) -Constant pressure/fear of being fired -Managers tend to manage up to their managers, do not focus on team members success"
2566,5.0,Only con I would say if you are being hired from outside the organization you typically come in a level below your current role which actually turns into a benefit because people that make a lateral move often struggle and take 2x to ramp.
2567,3.0,"Commissions have taken a big hit. Over the years if I sold 100k in one month I would have made 10-15k. Now you're looking at 2-3k. OTE is something you could have easily blown away, now you'll find fewer than 10% of people hit their OTE."
2568,5.0,- Very high growth expectations that are not easy to achieve or blow out from a sales perspective. - Many reps on the sales team calling into the account
2569,5.0,Rapid company growth can be overwhelming.
2570,4.0,Still uses old technologies Not willing to get the latest languages. So legacy JavaScript language
2571,3.0,No Supervision / Very disorganized / Too many employees
2572,5.0,No cons that I can think of.
2573,5.0,Need to stay in a role for over 1 year
2574,5.0,Rapid company growth can be overwhelming.
2575,5.0,"I can't think of any, though cons could be perceived if you aren't comfortable with an extremely fast paced publicly traded organization. That's not an organizational fault, but solely a byproduct of how fast Salesforce is innovating to continue leading the industry and serving our clients."
2576,5.0,People working there have a little to much of an ego
2577,3.0,not a fan of being acquired by a massive co with a slightly insane CEO
2578,3.0,"Have you ever felt like just a number to a company? Well once you start your job at salesforce you become just one of the many thousands of AEs they have hired. You will be given a territory that will ultimately dictate how well you perform. Some AEs are given 2-3 territories while others are given just one. Regardless of your territory, you will have the exact same quota as those with larger ones. Its a numbers game to management. Your manager will want 2-3 of his or her AEs to do really well while everyone else struggles. You will have a monthly quota, your manager will be tasked with grinding you every month for every last dollar possible you can bring in. Not to mention 3 quarter ends and 1 year end, which many managers make you feel like the world is ending thereafter. Forget about a vacation at month end, quarter end or god forbid you have to miss January 31st."
2579,1.0,"Another tech giant trying to spread the company culture kool aid but doesn’t recognize or address terrible leaders and managers or self appointed “lead EAs”. Very toxic, backstabbing politics going on amongst executive assistants which creates an entire group of disgruntled, distrustful, and power hungry EAs and makes most EAs carry a bad reputation at Salesforce. Execs and managers who have EAs: some of them need serious management training and learn how to treat everyone under them fairly. This was by far some of the worst treatment I’ve ever seen from an exec who had an EA. Micromanaging, having other people spy on the EA and report back to him about the EA's whereabouts and movement.. The EA was treated like a prisoner. Also, there are some EAs who support C-level people and they act as if they are the exec's themselves. They wield their execs' status for their own power and control over others. It's ridiculous and I don't know if the execs who have EAs even know that their EAs are doing this. I hated working with any execs who had EAs. It was always a massive hinderance to my work progress. I don't understand Salesforce and the EA culture.. some are really great EAs but some are terrible and unfortunately they are the EAs at the top.. usually supporting SVP and up. I wouldn’t buy into their culturally appropriated “OHANA” and other Hawaiian sayings. It’s all a facade."
2580,2.0,Too many managers worrying about getting ahead and looking good vs focus on clients and employees. Degrading behavior and not recognizing or acknowledging different experiences and views. Only select few making money
2581,4.0,So much gossiping here across teams
2582,5.0,"***FOR SALESFORCE.ORG*** -we work hard but I'd say we maintain a solid work/life balance -HQ is located in San Francisco, so unless you have rent control it's quite an expensive city to live in! -High expectations of performance from Sr Management (however I find this as an interesting challenge and motivating)"
2583,4.0,"sales leadership, sales, constant change,"
2584,5.0,If you do not have consultative sales experience it may not be a fit.
2585,4.0,"The salaries are lower than our competitors, and they shouldn't be the case, given how great everything else is at the company."
2586,4.0,"Not too many cons... Apprentice don't have access to all of the benefits since we're part time (this is normal). Relative to geographic location, pay is pretty low for apprentice so living in the city can be tight money wise."
2587,4.0,red tape. getting too big. the processes are heavy such that a lot of the sales reps feel numbed by the heavy processes. big acquisitions feeling like the next oracle
2588,4.0,"As a growing company, there was not enough room for everyone especially in Indianapolis, Indiana. It was a bit inconvienient a few days starting with."
2589,2.0,Very political No life / work balance Overly metric happy - dashboards for everything Sales process too focused on short term goals
2590,4.0,some organizations managers are screwed up and makes life hell like the one i work for.. frequent top management changes bringing in new company directions.. still feels like startup mode company with lack of direction in IT.
2591,4.0,Extremely fast paced - such that priorities change too often. Leadership can sometimes promise impossible things that the rest of us have to figure out at any cost how to deliver which can be frustrating versus a rewarding challenge.
2592,4.0,"Salesforce ""floods"" the market with Sales Representatives. This only allows under 20% of the salesforce to make their quota."
2593,5.0,just a big company to navigate
2594,4.0,Company's fast growth and expectations from employees to meet the goals may stifle innovation and culture at times
2595,4.0,"As company grows it is slowly moving to typical large corporation where meetings take over results, hiring can be done based on ""we need to hire anyone not to loose quota)"
2596,4.0,Constantly shuffling territories; realigning Quotas increase significantly YoY
2597,4.0,Remote work is challenging given a very San Francisco centric culture. The impressive growth has been forgiving to inconsistent internal discipline. The culture will have a tough time adapting to the discipline required to take the company to $20B.
2598,5.0,"- Like anywhere, you can get lucky or not with a great manager -- most of my experience in this area was awesome - Depending on your group, hours can be tough at times"
2599,4.0,Company is changing quickly. Culture is less transparent than compared to the past and there is a new management style.
2600,4.0,"If you assigned accounts/territory is good, the position is good. If not, you will not last long."
2601,5.0,"still operates and thinks like a start up, even though it is a company worth $35 billion"
2602,5.0,It's big getting bigger... no so much a start up if that's what you're looking for.
2603,5.0,no technical challenges for fresh graduates
2604,4.0,The fast paced environment challenges a good work life balance Management changes are frequent and the related politics make for an unhealthy work environment in some teams
2605,4.0,"If you are in the sales/pre-sales org, work life balance really does not exist."
2606,4.0,"Constant restructuring, would need a high level of discipline to take charge of your career, easy to get lost and get silo-ed. Different orgs rarely interact with each other"
2607,1.0,"When you get your job eliminated and very little notice, just out the door along with 90+ other people. I understand it was a 'business decision' but they went about it ALL wrong and THEY DID NOT HELP US FIND NEW JOBS THERE DESPITE WHAT THEY TELL THE PUBLIC."
2608,1.0,it is competitive and people who actually do work are not valued people who know how to BS and talk a lot get promoted fast CMO does not trust directs and does not care to get to know people in marketing overwork its people for no reason
2609,4.0,"The pressure is always very high to make your numbers as a sales professional. As a growing organization (~14,000 employees), it can be slow to see material change to broken processes. With the growing number of acquisitions, the integration process can be very slow."
2610,4.0,The pace can be insane for mere mortals!
2611,4.0,Landscape is constantly changing. Lack of process. Not as meritocratic as other start-up type companies. Transforming into large company mentality where bureaucracy slows down innovation.
2612,4.0,"This is a big company that focuses mostly on B2B tech, so it can feel very corporate. Vibe depends on which division you're in."
2613,3.0,We're getting too big and are less and less connected with our employees. We struggle at times with deciding between doing what's right for the business and doing what's right for our people. It's inevitable with a mature business like salesforce.
2614,4.0,Too large of a company to feel important. Lack of transparency between the different level of management
2615,2.0,"The Hillsboro office culture is completely different disconnected from the culture at headquarters. Tech Support is a dead-end. They lure in new employees and recent college grads with ""career development"" talk, time to study and get other certifications, job shadowing, etc. You quickly learn none of that will ever happen. Getting a tech support job in Hillsboro will NOT help you get another job in a different department or location -- it can only hinder you, if anything. They're also constantly pressuring employees into working overtime because they're understaffed, but don't want to hire. The pay doesn't match the pressure and stress. The fancy office and the fluff doesn't make up for all of this, even though they hope it does."
2616,3.0,"Nowadays, things are completely different as ET gets 100% assimilated into Salesforce. It's a shame that the orange culture we all loved is going by the wayside. A large number of people have recently been laid off as part of the integration, and the company culture is just much less warm and innovative. Now it takes many levels of bureaucracy to get things done and it's more of a cutthroat environment."
2617,5.0,Achieving work-life balance is difficult under the pace the company is moving.
2618,3.0,Benioff is insane and is busier with philanthropy than anything else
2619,4.0,"- Management good. However, there is room for improvement. - Changing priorities are frequent - Very little, or no opportunities for advancement at Director level"
2620,4.0,"Lot of changes, politics in technology, expect more than usual from employees, if you have a large commute and kids to handle then you will suffer and feel hard to do *everything well, stocks will handcuff you so beware and move on if you are saturating"
2621,3.0,Seems that support is lacking at times Manager not proactive in supporting me.
2622,4.0,Salesforce is a very fast moving company. You should be comfortable with uncertainty if you work here and the type of person who is willing to dive in and fix a problem when they see it.
2623,4.0,"Not great at cultivating and nurturing talent. As an individual, you have to be driven to take your career and growth into your own hands. No one is going to hand-hold you through it."
2624,4.0,"High-Expectations, Ever-Changing, Remote, Corporate, Lack-of-Transparency"
2625,4.0,Fast growth provided some pains but luckily i was not among people effected.
2626,4.0,Management can be sometimes very unprofessional Integrity issues Too snobbish. Consider themselves the GODS of SaaS. A little away from reality. Micro-management and Bureaucratic Growth opportunities have been on a decline lately
2627,3.0,Falling behind others in terms of tech stack; lot of homegrown solutions that can't be taken elsewhere
2628,5.0,"First, it's NOT a startup, and while the company seems to have a great future ahead, it's not a fast-growth place where you're going to get catered meals, massages, and toys to play with every day. This shouldn't be a problem, but since the HQ is in San Francisco, people are reminded of all the perks and opportunities that abound just around the corner (or in Silicon Valley). Also, while the company is a great place to work, it tends to favor extraverts and people who desire to move up or who want to do lots of things outside their current job role. Being surrounded by ""movers"" like this can be exhausting if you're one who wants to be ""comfortable"" and seeks to achieve work-life balance."
2629,5.0,"Big company, lots f churn"
2630,4.0,Rapid growth means learning as you go sometimes.
2631,5.0,"Although engineering uses tons of open source software and tools, I wish Pardot & Salesforce ingrained it in the culture even more. Releasing official projects as open source could be done and encouraged more often."
2632,4.0,"old technology stack, infrastructure is slow to adopt, need faster release cycle,"
2633,5.0,"The ATS is a bit hard to train on, but once you get it it's not a problem. I've never really liked an ATS anywhere though!"
2634,1.0,"Others have said it and I wholeheartedly agree. This was the worst professional experience of my career. Learned a lot about how truly horrible a company can treat their employees. Really hard to get a job here unless you know someone and I did--what I didn't know was how much I was lied to with the promise of making a living. The only people who are happy here are the young kids who are striving to achieve success early on in their careers and those who have been at the company for years who are favored and given the good patches to actually make their goal. Such an insidious culture with back stabbing, soul less individuals that starts with the top management and continues through middle management. They are the worst. The Junior VPs who have been there for years, so made it early on but they are worse than the Executive VPs because they really have no talent and have no clue how to manage good people. Turnover rate is ridiculous and the actual number of people who make their goal is so incredibly low. The cube culture ensures that your cold calling (which is mostly what it has become) is heard by your boss so he, and the tenured people around you, can berate you for not moving the deal along. And don't even think about working from home--get there at 7am or you are looked at as a loser for not being committed to the cause. Selfish, manic, loud, seductive people do well here for a while or at least until they slip up and end up with the Dakota patch. Or quit because they can not take it anymore. Drunken culture too which is encouraged by the annual Christmas party which costs millions--it's lavish and luxe--and shameful and gluttonous. I had 3 friends quit for the exact same reasons I did and we look back at the experience unfortunately in the nightmares that still occur for the ""month's end"" because we are not closing squat."
2635,5.0,- On boarding is a bit overwhelming...but thats normal anywhere. They do the best job they can making you feel welcome. I was happy with my on boarding.
2636,3.0,"Salesforce has an interesting way of recognizing and measuring success, which is mostly driven by tooting your own horn. The practice of ""building you brand"" is more important to your career than doing intelligent and meaningful work. The company is driven by sales and this causes unrealistic expectations on both the sales side as well as product rollout. Many (but not all) of the low to mid level managers are either unqualified or strive too hard to please superiors. The company is more focused on showing and telling about how great it is than actually being great."
2637,3.0,"I am only giving the company three stars because while I enjoyed the perks of working for a well respected, game-changing company, I also did experience some negative experiences due to incompetent management, a high rate of turnover, and a limited amount of growth within the company. I felt as though there was a lot of brown nosing going on, and the politics was a huge reason for my departure. I also encountered more than 5 managers in my 2 1/2 years there which was disconcerting."
2638,1.0,"constant reorganization. many joke that they are on their 5th manager in 1 year extremely unprofessional, angry leaders. it's not uncommon to see people ""torn apart"" in meetings. it's not uncommon to see highly inebriated leaders at offsites - slurred speech, difficulty standing, speaking openly about other employees they manage to their peers. there is extremely high turnover, so when you find a great peer group, often the ones you like the most will probably leave. promotions are all about building perception -- not about what you really do."
2639,5.0,Nothing I can think of.
2640,3.0,"Fast growth has led to certain challenges, specifically in terms of onboarding and complexity. It also feels like we're an afterthought to Salesforce. We're starting to get some of their benefits, but salary and especially bonus discrepancies continue to be the norm according to Glassdoor reports."
2641,5.0,Not really any... I know people will always come up with something but it's a place where what you put in it what you get out of it.
2642,5.0,None - keep doing what you are doing
2643,4.0,"Only somewhat disappointing thing is that they seem to be a little cheap on the hardware they are willing to provide to employees. It shouldn't be hard to get nice monitors, and IT shouldn't be a second class citizen."
2644,5.0,"- too much training - managers care about you - i've made too many friends - wait, these are all Pros"
2645,4.0,Sometimes when you work in a such a big company it's hard to get noticed for the value you provide and when it's as big as Salesforce it's hard to get assigned to work on truly strategic projects.
2646,4.0,"For enterprise sales and operations, need to mature and better align with enterprise customers buying/budget cycles. Can't expect customer to buy every month when large enterprise buy once every 1-3years."
2647,4.0,"The tech can seem a bit fragmented in such a large organization, and there is sometimes an overemphasis on product marketing."
2648,4.0,"Long hours, unending change in process and territories. Super aggressive timelines mean we don't usually get to do our best work."
2649,4.0,"Success really depends on the leadership of your org. Some leaders are authoritative but lack empathy. Extroverted personalities tend to be rewarded while introverts tend to be ""managed out"" or bullied. Work/Life balance suffers occasionally."
2650,4.0,"Very high pressure environment. Sales people respect the craft, so you need to be sharp and heavily detailed. Do not expect to coast here."
2651,3.0,Low pay compared to other software companies Territories are very small and managers give best ones to the people they like Need to be in the office everyday Feels like a cult at times
2652,1.0,"Favoritism by management. Accounts are hand selected so that favorites make their number while others are given ""whitespace"" accounts that don't buy. Marketing cloud is selling while service cloud is floundering."
2653,4.0,"It is so disciplined that it is difficult to find time for brain storming, need to keep everything predictable and get results, little research investment."
2654,3.0,"Not really seeing much equality at least for my team. Focus is always on HQ folks or team members located in same office with manager. No matter how much hardwork, time, effort & success stories long serving regional folks have, promotions & opportunities always go to HQ & new hires."
2655,3.0,high pressure and crazy deadlines
2656,4.0,functional teams are huge and everyone's role is very specific/limited to one particular area. work gets boring over time
2657,2.0,nobodyknew what they were doing .. from HR to the so called sales manager/supervisors
2658,4.0,"Getting started is still rough. Weeks of training, setting up your computer, waiting for other people to give you access to resources you need, and finding out information about anything is tough. We use chatter and google docs to keep track of random information like where to get a company phone or what API to use for integration with such and such. But both resources are a conglomeration of obsolete and inapplicable information. While we do pride ourselves on having an open culture, it isn't necessarily a very exciting, friendly or personal culture. You're generally free to do what you like, but many (maybe most) teams don't go to lunch together and aren't friends with each other. They just have small talk and do what it takes to get the job done well. Since your team is who you're with all day and who you talk to most of the time, it's kind of important. I wish it was the other way around, where my team was wanted to talk too much and spend more time hanging out than I did. The employees are kind of old here, so it's just not what I'm used to I suppose. Also, spoiled as I already am here, I will always be jealous of companies that have free cafeterias because I can't cook."
2659,3.0,"The Culture in the Chicago office took a nose dive this year. With fast growth a lot of the wrong people were promoted to leadership positions and have sucked some of the life out of the organization. (On the plus side things move fast so they probably wont be in those roles for too much longer). Their is also a clear political path to success, be liked by the group that is running the show and you will be rewarded with a greater share of the potential sources of commission compared to your peers (There is a loosely defined territory policy which can either be a huge benefit or detriment to your career). The downside is that it appears most of the ""have's"" already have been selected."
2660,2.0,Moved to Indy from Ann Arbor. Indy was not too exciting and little other tech employers. My partner and I ended up with great jobs in Chicago with much better pay and benefits.
2661,4.0,Your success in sales is highly dependent on your patch(account base) which is hard to predict coming in the front door. The intensity of the company is great but the work/life balance if off as the demands of the job creep into all aspects of your life. Sales quotas go up every year and territories decrease which can be hard to keep up with. The product offering is getting more and more complicated and hard to keep up with. Management changes all the time as I had four managers in a span of 18 months. Their product offering while extensive does not do well in certain verticals so make sure your accounts are in those good verticals. The core CRM product is too complicated and not intuitive as they make it seem.
2662,2.0,"After 3 years you will be burned out and no further ahead in your career. If you find you are not burned out, congratulations! You are among the super-humans who can handle working 60 hours a week, playing politics, and working in a whirlwind environment. You know who you are - you run triathalons and scale mountains! If, however, you wish to have a balance in life, after 3 years you will start to look elsewhere for your next career move. Having Salesforce.com on your resume will open many doors for you, so you can take your career in any direction - start-up, mid-sized company, start out on your own, large company - you name it! So go ahead, take that job at Salesforce.com, just know it's a step in the right direction toward where you really want to be!"
2663,2.0,"Things have changed now since 2 years or so.. lots of bureaucracy, heir achy politics at grass root level.. no more an innovative and open kind of culture, its turning more into legacy kind of companies. If you think you can thrive in such an environment this is the place !"
2664,4.0,Not a lot of HR and employee support. Lots of department silo's and duplicate functions in different groups.
2665,2.0,"People management is very bad... There is massive title inflation. 0-1 year of experience managing people marks most directors, and even many senior directors. There is a serious problem of cronyism in many departments. VPs promote who they want, when they want irrespective of team feedback or even despite what are believed to be established policies. VP-level leadership exhibits schizophrenic decision making, CYA behaviors and abrasive comportment. This makes for highly stressful working environments and is a key cause of the well-known burnout at Salesforce. Many leaders at Salesforce have never done a job this big before which can lend to insecurity and erratic or absent decision making. Reorganizations are painfully frequent which also promotes insecurity & stress."
2666,1.0,Quotas are unattainable. They are peanut butter spread with complete disregard as to what the opportunity is in the territory. The culture is not corporate at all-if you expect management to behave like adults then you need to look elsewhere. It is getting to be more like Oracle every day. No one cares about the customer or the employee.
2667,3.0,"Have you ever felt like just a number to a company? Well once you start your job at salesforce you become just one of the many thousands of AEs they have hired. You will be given a territory that will ultimately dictate how well you perform. Some AEs are given 2-3 territories while others are given just one. Regardless of your territory, you will have the exact same quota as those with larger ones. Its a numbers game to management. Your manager will want 2-3 of his or her AEs to do really well while everyone else struggles. You will have a monthly quota, your manager will be tasked with grinding you every month for every last dollar possible you can bring in. Not to mention 3 quarter ends and 1 year end, which many managers make you feel like the world is ending thereafter. Forget about a vacation at month end, quarter end or god forbid you have to miss January 31st."
2668,5.0,Work life balance can sometimes be a challenge.
2669,3.0,"Work-Life balance is very difficult to achieve in Sales organization. Constantly changing management with lots of Oracle culture seeping into Salesforce and it's not good. I feel like I'm back at Oracle now - not fun. This was not the case when I joined Salesforce 3 years ago. Many Oracle managers have not embraced the Salesforce culture, and have increased demands on sales performance, micro-managing, excess administrivia. The workload has increased with staffing not keeping pace. Over-sized workload is contributing to employee burn-out and compromising performance. And it's getting worse. Nothing matters but $$$ to most managers hired from Oracle. Loved the company when I started but my opinion has soured over the last 1-2 years."
2670,5.0,Territories are shrinking. Moving up doesn't guarantee higher OTE. Not a lot of flexibility around working from home
2671,5.0,Growing pains as they transition to larger company
2672,4.0,"Lack of structured offices in the region, what makes the client life harder."
2673,5.0,Fast moving. Lots of change.
2674,4.0,- Monthly cadence can be a challenge - Territories can be tight
2675,2.0,Converting the QA employees in to Developers. Requiring QA to do both Develpment work and QA
2676,4.0,"Tough gig in product sales, you really don't control the account and can be de-prioritized if the Core AE is working to close a deal. A lot of ""hold off on reaching out, I'm trying to get this (insert other product) deal done this quarter""."
2677,3.0,Diminishing respect for Sales Engineering Profession. Less compelling career opportunities. Lagging customer success. Overly aggressive sales culture. Low-quality account executives.
2678,4.0,Factory feel to services No stock options to PS No effort on work/life balance No room for growth
2679,3.0,Nobody cares for designs other than the designers themselves. Management just want to get stuff out and don't care much about the quality of the product.
2680,4.0,Not as attractive as other options down in the Valley...just a sign of changing times. Getting bloated. Ego among the senior ranks.
2681,3.0,Monthly closing of books created an environment of not being able to be more strategic within the group. Lots of politics at the Sr. Sales level and internal channel conflict driven by the compensation structure.
2682,3.0,"lots of food is wasted, management style is not good. Too much micro-management, it seems like they do not trust their staff. No career path defined."
2683,4.0,"Technical debt is building up, and scaling has become difficult since the business is doing so well. Communication between departments is rough sometimes."
2684,3.0,"You don't get free lunch or dinner, unlike many other companies in proximity. Google, Facebook, Twitter, Uber are just a few to name."
2685,4.0,"This organization is not immune to the usual corporate politics. Not enough diversity in the organization, even though they highlight diversity as one of their strengths. Once you get passed the Manager roles, the percentage of non-white Directors and drops drastically"
2686,4.0,Travel and irrational clients. Difficult to be heard when assigned to a project well underway.
2687,4.0,Very subjective quota measurement based on creating opportunities - can be completely gamed by having your Account Executive tip you off to conversations they are having and then letting you enter the opportunity in
2688,4.0,"As the company has gotten larger, more politics and expanding into realms outside its legacy technologies, is on a learning curve/culture change..."
2689,4.0,"The arrogance, and the Oracle culture that is taking over."
2690,4.0,"Much focus on Velocity and my suggestion is to emphasis on Quality, teams still learning on service fundamentals, some of the engineering areas is little behind when compare to other tech companies."
2691,4.0,Can be more focused on sizzle/marketing than on results. Important to be well-connected & have senior exec patronage for success.
2692,4.0,Too much tolerance for bad leaders in pockets of the organization who are savvy politically.
2693,3.0,- Sales and marketing driven company - not a technology company - Treats engineering as a liability and not an asset - High attrition
2694,3.0,The bigger it gets the more it loses its edginess & appeal.
2695,4.0,Automation is given a very high high priority because of which customer centric thought process is taking a less priority from a quality perspective.
2696,5.0,"Transitioning from a startup to an established enterprise corporation and learning new processes that used to work but don't, now that we have scaled and grown."
2697,4.0,* It's very political-- make the right friends * Clique-y-- sometimes it feels like high school * Smaller territories-- they keep shrinking-- and the quotas keep rising * Compensation is decent but not competitive with a lot of offers for similar roles in the area (but if this is an issue-- see my pros-- you won't have a hard time making more money elsewhere) * Can feel a little boiler room
2698,5.0,All Levels: Company is getting bigger - not as big as SAP or Oracle - but no longer a 'startup'. At Executive Level: The old-timers who have been around for 5-10 years and 'acquired execs' run the show. Very difficult for anyone else to rise up the ranks. Not enough space.
2699,4.0,too many changes in policies due to re-orgs.
2700,5.0,"The company is growing at a rapid speed, and so should work on aligning goals for different teams going into multiple directions. But we are improving"
2701,3.0,"In sales, there's hardly any work/life balance."
2702,5.0,I don't have any Cons to report!
2703,5.0,No real cons here. I like everything.
2704,5.0,"There are 2 cons in my mind: 1) The reward for good work is more work. 2) They say that they follow agile methodologies, but it is really a crude bastardization of disconnected process."
2705,5.0,"The merge of Salesforce and ET has made accessing some systems extremely difficult at times with more the one help desk to turn to and a lot of misunderstand of responsibility. Seems like ""growing pains"" but likely just the timing and will get worked out over time."
2706,4.0,"Leadership can be scattered, causing delays in making things happen"
2707,5.0,Not much really. It is a very fast paced environment when many may not like. But works great for me.
2708,5.0,I change managers two times a year. It seems like there are a lot of shuffling within middle management.
2709,5.0,At it's busiest it's all-consuming but part of that is everyone wants to give 110% of all time because they love not only the company but who the work with. Team's are tight-knit.
2710,5.0,this is a hot box environment and you need to be fast and furious to carve out your space and performance in the company.
2711,5.0,Fast paced environment means there's no time to sit back and relax.
2712,4.0,Big company Layers of complexity New products and solutions acquired frequently
2713,3.0,"They want fresh minds in order to mold them into the ""Salesforce"" way. It's more important to build your brand and network internally rather do your job. No communication is shared about the sales process and they will continuously throw curveballs at you."
2714,3.0,In a support position it is difficult to get out. The management do not seem to be interested in helping their subordinates grow professionally.
2715,3.0,"It's a company for sales people who sell to sales people. While it's not cut throat, it does require a level of social agility to be successful."
2716,1.0,"The company grew too fast. Large amount of tech debt, hard to implement change in the environment, management lacks knowledge of the complex infrastructure and product. Everything in the IT and Operations teams ends up as a fire drill with no strategic direction to resolve the underlying causes."
2717,4.0,Growth at such a quick and rampant rate can cause for a lot of employee shifting from job to job. That sometimes can cause concern or confusion for the end clients.
2718,3.0,remote employees such as me struggle to find info and support from headquarters.
2719,4.0,"no life - between the work load and company events, say goodbye to your personal life."
2720,4.0,"Stale systems, low stock compensation, finance role can be slow moving and lacking in innovation. Interview process is often rushed"
2721,4.0,Lack of HR functionality and very hard to advance the career
2722,4.0,"- Fast pace and high pressure are a common thread throughout the company, which can make it hard to balance the demands of family life"
2723,4.0,Quota is not realistic/achievable. Very stressful as they look at monthly quota.
2724,5.0,"Lot of work, tight dead lines."
2725,4.0,"Not enough structure, career path and promotions difficult to understand"
2726,3.0,The apprentice program was a trick. they told us it was a job that gradually transitioned to a Sales Rep but its a lie. you have to interview and they only hire a select few on. The interview is pretty tough so its puts you in awkward place of having to find a job again
2727,5.0,"The fast pace and constant change. You need to get to know people on a personal level, which is great for someone that likes to meet new people. Theres a ton of change that's constantly happening, and making friends along the way makes it better to comprehend, and feel more secure in your own position."
2728,4.0,"ExactTarget leads the industry and wants to hold on to that spot. However, as they grow they are falling into the same issues as their competitors: How do we keep the small company appeal with thousands of employees? They are struggling at the moment. A lot of changes in leadership and new policies put in place that bring down that start up feel."
2729,5.0,Not much to report here. Work/life balance can be a little challenging; there is lots to do and the company is growing quickly so if you are looking to just cruise this is probably not the place for you.
2730,4.0,"we outgrew our own infrastructure, so many cracks 4 years ago are now gaping holes. Competing against B2C culture when we are B2B."
2731,2.0,Issues that do come up don't get pushed high enough in the organization to make a difference. IT organization is a mess and needs a complete overall from the top down.
2732,2.0,Salesforce is now a well-oiled machine. Rules of engagement make it nearly impossible to do your job and most territories/patches have been saturated. They are also now putting more AE's in territory.
2733,5.0,"You have to be open to change, which can be hard for some. Our environment evolves rapidly and it's not necessarily for the faint of heart. If you are looking to clock in and out, or looking to do the same thing every day, I would not think this would be the ideal environment for you."
2734,5.0,Hiring lots of senior leaders from Oracle these days. I've never worked for Oracle so I don't know if that's a good thing or bad but I know a lot of unhappy people there these days.
2735,4.0,Sometimes overtime is very pushy. Management is not very clear. Different people might lead you at same time.
2736,4.0,"It can be hard to hang on in such a competitive culture. If you are not a top performer, it can be very challenging."
2737,4.0,"Salesforce is growing rapidly, and as a result is hiring a large volume of unqualified middle management. Additional processes slow down sales cycles."
2738,4.0,Lots of changes happened all at once when I was there. Too fast for me. It's probably eased up a bit by now.
2739,4.0,Hard to find anything wrong in Salesforce.
2740,4.0,"The economy is forcing Salesforce to eliminate some of the previous benefits like company phones, car plans"
2741,3.0,"beware being perceived as ""too radical"" (trying to innovate here) in your proposals to management. it will limit your career incredibly fast."
2742,4.0,Satellite office doesn't allow for much advancement. You need to relocate to grow and advance within the company.
2743,3.0,Start stop hiring is a pain. Premium placed on presentation of ideas and rhetoric versus content and rigorous analysis. Political environment.
2744,2.0,Highest turnover company in Fortune 500. Lots of politics and benefit is not great compare to other silicon valley companies.
2745,4.0,Sales held to a different standard than the rest of the company and the exterior perception.
2746,4.0,"Top heavy, upper management not in sync with what is happening on the ground, too many re-orgs."
2747,4.0,Smaller Territory and Comp plans really got bad fast.
2748,3.0,Sales leadership has changed focus and is operating in panic mode. Losing focus on support and the resources for the smaller users is becoming all self service.
2749,2.0,"Extremely short staffed, meaning workload is immense and the metrics pressure is insanely stupid putting undeserved pressure on employees. Upper management is completely clueless about anything that doesn't appear on their dashboard."
2750,1.0,"all sheen, no substance - database issues no one understands, constant outages, slow performance, and weak executives imported from Microsoft contribute to worst infra operations you can imagine"
2751,4.0,Inside sales is high pressure and a lot of call center type of sales
2752,4.0,"Hired to be creative, but sat in meetings all day. Creative content is soul-sucking."
2753,4.0,"Management wants to get great survey scores from clients, but tied our hands on budget/scope on engagements with no wiggle room"
2754,4.0,small territories that take a long time to cultivate
2755,4.0,- some of the new products they have added confuse the messaging - chatter product over played - sales territories can be very small
2756,3.0,"- TPM role in R&D is just plain bad, life & motivation sucking vampire."
2757,3.0,In a support position it is difficult to get out. The management do not seem to be interested in helping their subordinates grow professionally.
2758,4.0,"Very political, more interested in number and looking like people are doing thier jobs then actually focusing on ROI and moving the company forward."
2759,2.0,Politics rule here. Performance is based on how well you play political games. 100% a boys club and HR will not respond to harassment complaints.
2760,4.0,Um... Thanks for the always-stacked snacks... lacked variety though. Would be great if they can serve lunch at the company
2761,4.0,Great company but becoming too big for it's own good. Some of middle management is not very well qualified but are there by chance - timing. Can have a very Bro culture.
2762,3.0,Headquarters centric. Unless you're in San Francisco you don't get the same culture and its an uphill battle to get in with the top projects.
2763,3.0,"""Mean Girls"" environment. Super competitive for titles and promotions."
2764,3.0,"That being said, the work itself was really not challenging. I was bored during my day-to-day, I wasn't being stretched, and although that wasn't an immediate priority, it became a priority after 6 months. I wanted to love what I did and I wasn't in love with being a sales rep here. Fun people, but I wasn't being stretched."
2765,2.0,"The ultimate in high school clique culture. It's tough to move if you're not on a list of favorites. The cult of Salesforce is exhausting. Yes, great product, yes great benefits, but the 'kool aid drinking blowhard' mentality wears thin. If you work in the office, you're expected to be in the office. In commercial, no opportunity to telecommute. Growing at a frustratingly large pace. Headcount doubled in my time there. Everything is always in flux it seems."
2766,1.0,"Very difficult to explore new opportunities if you're in the creative department. There's a real absence of leadership and management talent there. The atmosphere has been incredibly negative and political for the past 3 years, so if you're interested in another role you'll need to leave the company (you'll be given that advice if you express interest to your manager). The department is purposely trying to become an ad agency, except the department leads don't want to partner with other teams and are openly adversarial when they're not in front of execs. The department leads set a bad example by frequently talking trash about colleagues outside the creative team and that doesn't help anyone. If you're considering leaving your agency gig to take a client side role, this is not the place you'll want to call home."
2767,4.0,Growing competition in SMB segment. Work life balance. Increasing politics at the top. Culture is being eroded - becoming more like Oracle.
2768,5.0,The hours were long and tiring. People expect you to work more than your assigned hours.
2769,5.0,I haven't found one yet
2770,5.0,"strict badge policy, exclusive mobile app use"
2771,4.0,"Could be difficult to maintain healthy work-life balance, and salary rate is lower than average offer on the market for the same roles."
2772,4.0,"The salaries are lower than our competitors, and they shouldn't be the case, given how great everything else is at the company."
2773,4.0,Not as attractive as other options down in the Valley...just a sign of changing times. Getting bloated. Ego among the senior ranks.
2774,5.0,As the company continues to grow the territories become smaller making it tougher to compete against large market areas.
2775,4.0,"Salesforce ""floods"" the market with Sales Representatives. This only allows under 20% of the salesforce to make their quota."
2776,3.0,Major major problems with culture. Highly antagonistic and not team-oriented - reminds me a lot of Microsoft. I wish I had known this before coming here as it is pervasive and apparently well known within the valley. I think a lot of people are dazzled by the brand and are quickly disillusioned with the culture. Having major growing pains as they incorporate other big companies (Exact Target) and just growth in general.
2777,3.0,Poor senior leadership. Make sure managers have development plans for getting employees to the next level. New senior need to better embrace and use the Salesforce products.
2778,4.0,* Can be Confusing during initial phases as there is no job clarity..Its not only me but a frequent complain I hear . * Job travel is expected irrespective of roles.
2779,3.0,"The same people keep getting promoted - ""visionary"" salesmen - not the people who actually do the work. Projects are only 60% completed before the groupthink in ""leadership"" decide to move on to the next shiny thing. Sales are always first priority and take up about 90% of the attention. Clients, employees, technology, have to clamour for the remainder. No Signing Bonus Annual/Quarterly Bonuses are nominal until you are at least director level - and there's no path to promotions."
2780,4.0,"Aggressive, transactional culture. Great for some personalities, not for everyone. Territories are hit or miss, seasoned reps get best areas, accounts"
2781,5.0,Not as many free lunches as there used to be - not a big deal but can't think of much else.
2782,3.0,Fast paced.Lwss Work Life balance
2783,5.0,"Some orgs have lethargic decision making processes in some teams. If we don't innovate fast enough, competition or disruption will catch us."
2784,5.0,"Location strategy is incredibly San Francisco centered - don't expect leaps and bounds of advancement outside of HQ, but that's really any company."
2785,5.0,Slow IT department. Hard to find an Org chart to navigate through the company.
2786,5.0,Not good if you dont like to work hard and challenge yourself. To excel you need to put in the hours and have a desire to be a top performer. There are no free lunches.
2787,4.0,"SFDC is growing by leaps and bounds, this has created a situation where tons of business processes are needed and nonexistant. Normally this wouldnt be an issue but the response to need has become ""you cant do that"" instead of ""how can we get this done"". Compensation below average (total package is pretty good though)"
2788,5.0,"I hear that politics and such exist at the higher levels, but that's fortunately not visible much at the individual contributor level. If you have a good manager, you don't hear of such things, and you get to just focus on your work and career. So perhaps this is really a 'pro' than a 'con.' Priorities can and do shift regularly. It's really a part of the nature of software development. Top-down changes of directions can and do occur, though most have been huge successes. If you want a place where you go off into a corner and code on one thing for months or years, then Salesforce.com is not the place for you. Everything is collaborative, and you must be able to work well in a team. If you don't, then you'll hopefully learn quickly :-). Work-life balance can be difficult to achieve if you are eager to help everyone who comes your way with questions. It's really a matter of self-discipline to achieve a work-life balance, and it's almost all within your control."
2789,2.0,"-Work/life balance can be a challenge here, the company is very nimble (upper management) but do not consider downstream affects and operationally, can be very difficult to accommodate -Upper management usually does not care if you need to move mountains to accommodate their needs -Depending on your team, there is really little collaboration and teamwork, feels like every man for himself -The company focuses a lot on the sales org but very little on internal operations or internal groups which makes it hard to feel motivated to work here -This is the first job that i've ever had that I feel like I NEED to work during my vacations"
2790,5.0,Not enough vegetarian options ;)
2791,2.0,Growing pains is an understatement. High stress - low satisfaction. Poor decisions leading to a lot of impact to people's job roles.
2792,4.0,Had to train my replacement. Company didn't seem to give a damn that they were affecting technical support for whole company by moving their service desk to Portland
2793,4.0,"Many different scrum teams brings up its own challenges, sometimes other teams will add work to your backlog and you will be required to sign off without much notice, siloed information across different units"
2794,4.0,"The rate of change is huge. Often the ready, fire aim approach doesn't work when we are now a large company. We are like the awkward teenager who is growing too fast and fumbling along the way."
2795,4.0,You need a good functional manager; otherwise your promotions get delayed Too much hierarchy and competition to rise the ranks
2796,3.0,To many SILO's Need better overall management in TechOps Invest in newer technologies Do not re-invent wheel; do not try to become Google/Facebook/Twitter....Salesforce has different business and SLA's with customers to meet customer business requirements. Customers rely on Salesforce to run there businesses.
2797,4.0,Compensation model and caps are brutal
2798,5.0,"Really fast paced environment with shifting and unclear priorities. The company values are clear, figuring out how to get there isn't always clear."
2799,5.0,Nothing much at this time
2800,2.0,"No organization or leadership capabilities to speak of. If you value great snacks and bridge views over people who take an interest in your development, value your contributions, and care if you actually can have a personal life then this is your place. Leaders here only manage upward, no time for employees. Hugely political with redundant functions falling over each other, no clear decision making, and little connection between resources and strategic initiatives. No time for planning but plenty of time to do the same things new over and over again. Competitive internal culture among senior leaders"
2801,3.0,Not clear on career progression. Politics
2802,3.0,HR process a bit unorganised. Takes a long time for someone in HR or IT to get back to you due to current process.
2803,2.0,"""Ol Boy Network Structure"" live and well."
2804,4.0,Its very big so you'll find it difficult to get your ideas through
2805,4.0,Growing pains with a fast paced environment. Leadership is working to provide better work life balance however no near term end in sight.
2806,4.0,"Big company feel, not as easy to get things down as it was before."
2807,3.0,"Mediocre pay, politics, easy to get lost in the shuffle"
2808,3.0,Many middling people coasting by. No stock. A lot of political positioning for such a small organization on titles and rank were distracting and sometimes demoralizing.
2809,4.0,Lack of diversity and equality; heavy emphasis on referrals contributes to this
2810,2.0,Politics unfair treatment based on who you know not what you know
2811,4.0,"Must learn the Salesforce way and abide by their playbook. Lot of promotions from within, so a lot of management started from the bottom and made their way up without much experience elsewhere."
2812,5.0,Tough to work from home.... office culture - but could be more flexible
2813,1.0,"Inflated titles and absent support staff leads to many ""managers"" and ""directors"" who are purely individual contributers. All managers and directors have individual contributor duties. For people managers, headcount are constantly changing--just because you have a team of 6 this year doesn't prevent half of them from being taken away next year. Management structures change multiple times per year, and even change above the CIO. The internal systems are falling apart and leaders all the way up are much more focused on politics and image. They completely neglect anything objectively meaningful or helpful. The environment has gotten so toxic in the last couple years that leaders semi-openly talk about trying to get out of here. The CIO doesn't lead the organization at all, and everyone goes to either the ""chief of staff"" or the head of the PMO instead. The chief of staff is not qualified / competent to run a single department, let alone being a de facto head of IT. IT is forced to pay for all related costs out of the IT G&A budget with no charge-backs. This inflates our budget and hides that we're actually significantly underfunded, especially considering the technical debt. (we've almost figured out wifi in the last year, but we still need wired hubs in the conference rooms) Much worse than the state of IT is the state of Finance. Every month we're asked to change behavior because something in accounting /finance changed, or something was miscoded or reclassified and no one knew until after the books closed. People and processes change so often that there is no chance of hitting your budget honestly, or even understanding where it came from. We are told that it's worse to be under budget than overbought, because if we're under in any quarter, we potentially lose that budget going forward. You can imagine the consequences of that policy. The financial systems are a joke. We don't know how to support finance and consequently, they can't support us. What we report is massaged by accounting manually in Excel to a degree that we cannot effectively speak to our own numbers. As a result everyone involved is frustrated, failing, and looking for an out. No one in leadership is willing to acknowledge the fundamental problems as the culture requires us to be ever-positve in public and to ""just make it work"", then report success. I believe this is because (1) CEO is a salesman first, leader second, and doesn't want to hear it, and (2) because everyone up the chain would rather claim success and move to a different company, than stay and actually try to fix anything."
2814,3.0,work on weekends for the company.
2815,2.0,"Extreme growing pains have lead to many overworked/under-valued employees and under-resourced departments. Burn-out is prevalent throughout the company. Although comp packages were historically competitive, they now lag competitively."
2816,4.0,Need to balance traditional approaches with innovation in development and decision making internal processes. Focus on agile teams may cause greater efficiencies to be lost.
2817,5.0,For me at-least commute is too long. Everything is perfect. no other cons i could think off.
2818,4.0,"As a salesperson, you are accountable for everything. Billing department is of no use, service department is of no use. You really have to work hard to ensure things go smoothly."
2819,5.0,The fact that there are multiple buildings dispersed throughout San Francisco makes it difficult to collaborate across teams. Some meetings feature a Go To Meeting or phone call with someone a ten minute walk away.
2820,3.0,- Sales and marketing driven company - not a technology company - Treats engineering as a liability and not an asset - High attrition
2821,1.0,"- Was sold to me as a ""strategy job"" but don't be fooled this is 80% sales ops - The hours, you work like you're in a start-up without any of the equity - Pay is low for this type of role, even in comparison to most start-ups - The team is very short staffed and cannot handle the workload it's constantly given - The systems used are terrible, slow and outdated. Performance issues with the analytics tools can easily add 2-3 hours to your day. - I really can't stress enough how bad the hours are"
2822,5.0,"Slightly unorganized, cross-department communication challenges, hard work-life balance, promotions constantly being given to upper management. Work-life balance can be very hard--not sure if this is the place for someone who only wants to work 8-5, especially within Product and Services. Although they say you're only expected to work 40-hour weeks, the reality is that everyone will be working 45-60, sometimes more during certain times of the year."
2823,3.0,"Being in the Marketing Cloud in particular, there were many acquisitions and a terrible, negative culture. Now that ExactTarget has become a part of the Marketing Cloud, its a fight for control between Salesforce and ET. Not a fun place to be right now with all the changes and job security is a joke. Many ExactTarget employees and managers that came over from the acquisition are totally unprepared for their positions. Everyone there got promotions and I'd have to say the majority are completely unqualified. I don't see things turning out well."
2824,3.0,"it's a really lame culture, and you're definitely a cog in a machine. you will never be anything of importance, and if you're coming from a company where you were formerly working close to upper management or inter-departmentally, WATCH OUT...that won't be happening here."
2825,4.0,Scaled company can make you feel like a small piece of a huge machine.
2826,5.0,So many great ideas that some projects never quite get completed. A new product will get about 70-80% done and then the team moves on the next shiny new object.
2827,5.0,"Org'n structures change often. Sometimes, internal initiatives are not designed sufficiently before executing, leading to frustration and unclear goals/objectives."
2828,5.0,"Few people making the water murky. Due to selfishness some people tend step on others feet, which I am pretty sure every company has it. Higher management doesn't seem to notice it very often"
2829,5.0,Midwestern pay but cost of living in Indy is so low that this isn't really a Con. Much more opportunities for salary growth once you prove your worth. No complaints!
2830,4.0,"Unexpectedly long hours but it's sporadic, frequent desk changes and separation from teams"
2831,3.0,"crazy political; not all for one and one for all, but rather, all looking out for number one; sales culture has made everyone else into 2nd class citizens; higher-than-average comp doesn't pay for how embittered one becomes as a result of this environment"
2832,3.0,"As a big company, it was harder to get things done. Executives are not always in sync. It seems they prefer to hire from the outside rather than promote from within. Lots of changes going on these days."
2833,4.0,"Growing company size, more layers of management, decreased work patties"
2834,3.0,"Managers are allowed to yell, scream and carry out vendettas against employees Managers are allowed to disallow starting bonuses and regular bonuses at whims even if such is layed out in offer letter Managers are allowed to send irate emails after approved vacation is taken and while and during you are on holiday. Managers can arbitrarily tell you you need to work 12 hours a day for months on end. Absolutely no relief , no care if you have children or family Managers are allowed to pay 'respects' to female employees through coy comments and retorts. Ramp up/Training can be curtailed because a manager denies you the right to properly learn the project, thus making you unable to do your job Massive backstabbing by those around you and use of such by Management to control the players of their group, hearsay and mobbing. Managers are allowed to deny routine doctor visits based on how they see fit If you are granted remote work away from HQ, many have later been let go due to refusing to later relocate back to Corporate because a new manager takes over. No care about quality of work, all about quantity and hitting your dashboard gauges like a If you are burnt out and psychologically spent, you will be given a short time to resign or you will be fired. This will involve many rounds of bullying to make you sign a resignation letter. You will later be given one months severance if you sign a waiver. And the rub? All the managers were promoted. My result? Massive Financial loss due to doctors, psychologists, meds and inability to work for a year due to bullying. Here's to your 1:1:1 program Benihoff."
2835,3.0,"Only Product jobs are in Indy. Comp is only great if you live in the Midwest, if you're hired to work in a remote office be prepared to work with clients of similar skills sets that will make a lot more than you. Benefits are not equal per locale, some offices get parking, food, gyms, subway passes, etc. Simply because that's the bare min to acquire people in that locale, too bad for you if you don't live there. PTO is really poor compared to our parent company SalesForce Benefits are not up to par with our parent company SalesForce, try to find ET benefits and then find SF benefits. You'll notice ET's benefits are impossible to find and SF brags about theirs. That should be your sign. If you're assigned to SOW in Services or Support, there is little to no incentive to move you into something challenging. Most changes are done because of attrition as the organization are pretty flat outside of product. Salary bands don't exist, or if they do they are very lax. It's common someone on your team negotiated really hard and someone just took a college entry job. HR still doesn't have a classification for all skill sets in the field. SaaS margins puts a huge amount of pressure within Support/Services orgs, teams are currently being forced to find ways to offshore aspect of their work to India."

2839,2.0,"Dysfunctional management, mixed messages, super political, many products don't connect w/each other....It's a marketing machine. The biggest slide ware company in SV. HR is all about protecting the VP's who are driving to get the #'s in."
2840,3.0,"Huge quotas, small territories. % of people hitting their quota. New management from Oracle is changing the culture in a not so positive way."
2841,3.0,"Routine work, location of office."
2842,5.0,great pay but stock refresh could be much better.
2843,4.0,"The management doesn't really work very well. Lots of lip service given to ""promote from within"" even though most positions are filled from outside the company."
2844,2.0,"I was hired for one thing, and the first day there I was told I would be doing something different which required all travel. They said travel would decrease, but never did. Very misleading. Of the new people on my team, I lasted the longest at 1+ years. One guy only lasted 1 month. Probably an isolated case, but nothing was done to fix the situation"
2845,2.0,Politics unfair treatment based on who you know not what you know
2846,4.0,The pace can be insane for mere mortals!

2851,5.0,"Lot's of product updates, changes so there is a ton of training which can be overwhelming."
2852,5.0,Nothing bad to say about the company
2853,4.0,"There are a lot of processes in these roles that could be consolidated company-wide (or at least department-wide), that are not, which often times results in duplicate work or straying from the norm. Those processes need to be standardized. Sometimes it is hard to feel like a dialogue flows between colleagues, which is expected in an all remote environment, but a challenge nonetheless. The same goes for culture building, but efforts are being made, and I expect this to be more of a result of Remote work, and not the team/department. Processes often are overly complicated and should be assessed to whether or not they add value or could be simplified."
2854,1.0,"Oh where do I start, horrible politics and measly pay. They do not do stock refreshers so employees who have been there for long time get penalized. You have been warned, don't stay here for more than three years."

2871,5.0,Long hours at times and a pressure for sales success.
2872,5.0,"It's a very big company. At times things are slow, bureaucratic, and inefficient, but that comes with the territory. Internal mobility is possible, but not as easy as it should."
2873,3.0,"Besides the corporate politics you'll have to deal with and that you'll be paid significantly less than the market rate. The company has become the very thing they said they wouldn't become, they're a huge corporation now and the people outside of the top 10% of officers are only numbers to management. Don't believe in the headlines or your recruiter, at Salesforce you're nothing more than a number."

2882,5.0,Only con I’d say is that everyone starts as a contractor but I understand why.
2883,5.0,-Headcount growing perhaps too quickly which could transform the community feel to a more corporate environment -Does not offer full meals (light snacks and beverages are provided) -Signals of a more corporate future ahead evidenced by a shift away from local vendors to their global competitors
2884,2.0,Technical culture is struggling to stay current. Change comes slow at most big companies but this is the slowest I've seen. Technical culture is very conservative. Fear of making a mistake paralyzes teams from taking action.

2939,5.0,"Pressure of getting up to speed and performing starts as a soft buzz in the background that gets louder as you go. There is A LOT to learn - it's a big organization with particular ways of doing things. Also, there are almost too many channels of communication. So, all of this combined can be somewhat overwhelming at times."
2940,5.0,"Started during 1 month prior to Covid, which has impacted my ability to get face to face with customers and colleagues. Makes it more challenging to connect on a personal level."

2982,4.0,Work. It’s meaningless and a waste of time.
2983,2.0,"Many leaders have limited experience in enterprise technology and don’t understand its nuances, creating difficulty for employees. Individual contributors often end up managing up and receiving little support. Leadership consistently meets minorities with skepticism, doubt and microagressions. They severely lack empathy and have one vision of success. It’s a very homogeneous culture. If an employee is different, they are gaslit and “othered.” It’s been consistent that BIPOC employees experience mental distress at hands of peers and leadership. The Ohana has a serious culture problem and only making superficial strides to correct. It is the modern good ole boy."
2984,4.0,"We talk like we are in a start-up environment, but really, we are a high company."

2996,4.0,Lack of holistic vision across different orgs
2997,3.0,Many leaders in their positions simply because of tenure. Very unclear what actually matters to company any more. Extremely political. So many cooks in the kitchen on everything that things get sloppy and it's incredibly hard to move fast.

3004,4.0,"Onboarding, support, communication, leads, pipeline"
3005,4.0,Large company that has too many products
3006,1.0,Management bullies women - good ole boys network The commission system & calculation is broken - you're consistently having to fight for what is owed to you The territory system is broken - the San Francisco team consistently steals accounts from non-SFO territories (and gets away with it)
3007,1.0,All the positive Glassdoor reviews for Salesforce are the same. That's because they make new employees lie and fill out five star reviews saying they've been there a year during new employee orientation. Ohana is just propaganda. This company is incredibly irresponsible with their customers and you will feel bad every day working here. Read the one star reviews and ignore the identical fake five star reviews.

3014,4.0,tech stack is pretty outdated
3015,5.0,"Because Salesforce is in such an innovative industry, change is a constant. Most people go along with it fairly well, but if you resist change this would not be a good place for you. Expectations are high, but leaders are compassionate and help you achieve those high expectations."
3016,1.0,"Lot of politics, crappy tool and management."
3017,5.0,It is a brilliant company
3018,4.0,More and more political the higher up you go
3019,5.0,Sometimes the company can feel like is moving very fast and it is imperative for you to do the same to stay up to date with new products/ strategies. Not necessarily a con but it is important to have an agile mindset to be successful at Salesforce.

3028,5.0,None that I can think of.
3029,5.0,Turning into a large organization too quickly
3030,4.0,"- Change management and communication is not Salesforce's strong suit -- this can sometimes cause internal friction, or even have negative customer impacts because folks who need to know about changes may be not in a loop - Salesforce's approach and general attitude is very product, sales and marketing centric, which has been key to our success. However, for those of us who are in the services side of the business, the resources and enablement materials at our disposal is not as bountiful as they are, for say, SEs and AEs, so we not set up for success as much, making the job more difficult. - While Salesforce often says they put the customer at the center of everything they do, those who are not customer facing sometimes lack the ability to put themselves in customer shoes, but those of us who do interact with customers rely upon other internal teams to make them successful, so often times the biggest challenge is navigating our massive organization and hoping you'll be able to get the attention of the person who can help, and hoping they have the resources and time to help your customer."

3074,4.0,You need a lot of self-discipline
3075,5.0,"Be mindful of Sales and Services perspectives. As a PA, you are there to serve client, not necessarily sell stuff so you'll need to walk a fine line not to over sell and disappoint the account team."
3076,3.0,"- The biggest shock to me: how bad lower-level management is. Idk where these people came from but they are micromanaging, unrealistic, unhelpful, insulting...like the list really goes on. Maybe my expectations were too high coming to this amazing company but there needs to be more training for leaders. - Promotion process is terrible, you're expected to ""network"" to find any answers to anything and it ends up being a huge waste of time more often than not. And don't even think about leaving the sales org. Managers don't help and People across the company look down on BDRs. Also, the pay compared to other places is not good at all. $50K base in seat and after you promote to the next step. OTE increases in next role but not base salary no matter what you promo into. - High metrics, low commission - Like any other sales role, you are made to feel as though you are only as good as your numbers - The metrics are INSANE. Everyone knows people are just BS'ing their way through bc the metrics are so unrealistic - Work-life balance is horrible if you're actually trying to do your job the legit way and its high stress all the time despite whatever is going on in the world - Snobby AEs that are selfish but no one cares if you're hitting your number"

3085,3.0,All the pains that come with being a big company. Not a lot of organic growth.
3086,4.0,"There is no much career opportunities,"
3087,4.0,"- Depending on your role, your manager might not support the VTO during work hours - Depending on your role, you might not have any male salaries to compare against - The company and larger industry is still male-dominated, and you will still come up against entrenched sexism, this isn't utopia - ""Drinking from the fire hydrant"" is the work load. You either step up or leave during probation. If you do step up, you will reach your limit, then be overloaded again. If you're a workaholic and can balance that in a healthy way, great, but SFDC plays lip service to work-life balance in many departments. The work-life balance is often achieved through working from home while your family is asleep. - 99% of opportunities outside of the USA are sales-focussed"

3091,4.0,"Initial stage as a service consultancy. You have to find your own way. LACA region is pretty new and needs a lot of external expertise to build itself. Although it is necessary, it is still like a Frankenstein of methodologies and approaches that vary with management and teams."

3099,4.0,Right now I cannot see any cons
3100,5.0,"We work way too much. It's not necessarily that there's management pressure for it, but we just feel passionate about the company and our work, so we end up working all the time.

Managers hiring their relatives in their hierarchy which should not be allowed.
3112,4.0,"Mid management showing the classic signs of maturing IT companies. Ethnic managerial cliques that only hire subordinates from their culture. Lack of rigor or attention to proper processes and procedures. Overselling internal developments and projects to upper management solely to obtain promotions. ""Don't care"" attitude and lack of transparency. ""We'll fix it in phase 2"" attitude to badly-planned projects. Phase 2 never happens though."
3113,5.0,"At this moment I honestly cannot think of any legitimate cons to working for Salesforce. Any company will have unique challenges which will require adjustment on the part of staff, and Salesforce is no different. That isn't a con, but merely reality."

3120,4.0,Very fast pace A lot of rules to follow
3121,5.0,"If you're not someone that likes a go go go environment, this is not the place for you. Numbers don't lie, and you are tracked on everything."
3122,3.0,"Management or lack of Management. Misunderstanding in selling solutions - so many solutions when faced with a customer can become confusing to the customer what exactly they are speaking to SF.com about. Is it a CRM, Marketing Platform, Lead gen, Web Personalisation, Ad platform, Services?? I feel the AE's are sometimes spread to thin with so much to offer."

3129,5.0,None so far.
3130,4.0,I can say nothing much for downside

3134,5.0,Moving elsewhere will make you consider your decision
3135,1.0,8 cases per day unmanageable. Exhausted to such an extent you have no energy to even go out on the weekends. Salesforce is all work and more work unrealistic figures made up on the fly. It is pure exploitation and I resigned for the simple reason it took a toll on my health. You can't keep up this pace with out screwing your health. It's a good name to have on your CV stay a year and leave if you care about your well being.
3136,5.0,High-Pressure Environment Management from dashboards Self-Training
3137,5.0,Few that I can think of

3140,5.0,"The culture can be a bit cheesy and cringe worthy and I believe that change is a constant. I don't see that as a Con personally, but it maybe for other people."
3141,5.0,Not identified. Need more sun - if you need any con.
3142,3.0,"I cannot really count anything here. Maybe expect a bit of a hectic rampup if you are a laid back fellow, since only the best are expected and if you're not willing to keep up, be prepared to be left behind, but only after multiple attempts to rescue you!"

3184,5.0,Middle management is not good
3185,5.0,Will be in Dublin City in a couple of years
3186,5.0,Nothing bad to say currently
3187,5.0,"- I think there maybe too many Oracle people coming across that may eventually lead to a change in culture, make sure we only take the culture fit ones :) - Salesforce markets to the customer so well... sets the vision and goes on executing it.. there should be a communication strategy laid better to inform and communicate this to front line staff. - I think in some roles ( not my own ) aren't given the opportunity to expand on what they are doing they are placed in a box and have to wait their time to get some flexibility in what they can do / given a runway or roadmap ( this is just an observation on certain teams, this is not the case in my case ) so this maybe ill-informed."
3188,5.0,No cons seen so far. Even if seen i think it can be ignored.
3189,4.0,Rapid growth leading to tendency towards fiefdoms
3190,5.0,The pace is immense and can be overwhelming. You have to be disciplined in making sure you stop to take a breath! However the feeling of achievement balances this out.
3191,3.0,"The management, especially in the technical support team doesn't back their team and never try to understand the challenges from the team's perspective"
3192,5.0,- Pace can be relentless sometimes - Short term focus - Economy flights to San Francisco
3193,2.0,No value for the knowledge

3196,5.0,Not much to say here
3197,5.0,"Keeping up with all the products, their seems to be a new product every other day. Also the drawers of snacks and treats are too tempting!"
3198,5.0,- Low work life balance
3199,4.0,"Equality: There is a good focus on equality which is good as it is needed. In my eyes there is a lack of female managers or managers that understand how to use the strengths of having woman in the sales team. Overall, all managers have a checkbox they need to complete by hiring or interviewing woman, I think in the end they will be better in also give specific trainings to managers on how to actually manage a woman better. Remote worker: The biggest downfall of SF. A remote worker means they expect you to be in the office on a weekly base, rather more than less. Being used to work with Lync or Skype, there is a lack of the internal technology (acceptance) to make remote workers more involved remote instead of face to face. Everyone is using google hangouts or GTM. Internal presentations and meetings in my eyes should be 80% of the time remote."
3200,5.0,It's a fast pace work environment and change is the only constant here in Salesforce. With this dynamic environment brings stress and the pressure to perform as everyone is putting their best forward.
3201,4.0,"Not paid enough. Long working hours, not compensated for"
3202,3.0,Japanese Small Business Market is bad for cloud

3204,5.0,"Bigger and bigger, far from city center"
3205,5.0,"- Some teams don't practice all of the values of Salesforce, they only focus in on a couple - transparency is one that I feel needs to be developed more - London and Staines are very separate entities. By bringing more seminars and events to Staines, it will enrich the culture and lay some of the pressure off of the work space issue in London"
3206,5.0,"nothing, really great place to work"
3207,5.0,Career development can be somewhat limited
3208,5.0,"None as of now , there are no drawbacks as of now"

3214,5.0,No cons for the company
3215,3.0,"This company has serious pipeline issues, if they want to keep growing at 30%. They don't really care how this affects their employees. Quota is unattainable for most except a few ""favourite"" employees."
3216,5.0,nothing i can think of
3217,1.0,"Technically, the company is lackluster, yet has drunk it's own kool-aid, believing itself to be innovative. User interface is implemented with a proprietary framework (Aura) that is universally criticized by its users as inferior to Aspect and other industry standards, but is ferociously defended by company insiders. Similarly, storage is done via a proprietary layer atop a small number of massive Oracle databases. This means that one database outage affects a large number of customers. The Oracle centric mindset of the ""old boys"" has been incredibly resistant to change. Unit testing is slowly gaining acceptance, but is still by far the exception to the rule. The monolithic nature of the code base means that tests may take several days to catch regressions. Somehow, mediocrity and risk aversion have become the norm, perhaps due to the senior management blaming failures on the very staff who are doing more than the minimum possible, and are therefore ""visible""."
3218,5.0,no bad at this palce
3219,5.0,- Non cons as of yet
3220,5.0,Remote employees have to work harder to stay engaged
3221,5.0,"Chaotic at times, Higher management could be better"
3222,5.0,I don't think of any....
3223,5.0,Would like a wider variety of benefits.
3224,5.0,No office transport and food can be better
3225,3.0,"Senior leadership and culture. It is very political with an arrogant culture. It also tends to be ""helicopter"" leadership out of the States, when senior US leaders get involved in areas they know nothing about."
3226,5.0,Have to leave at some point
3227,5.0,Sales driven company requires to focus on Service as well
3228,5.0,Minimum development program for wmpl
3229,2.0,"I would not recommend anyone to work here!! Dont be fooled by the money and ""1 place to work"" Horrible culture, Great OTE waived at you but its (totally un-achievable) , People leaving everyday, such a unstable workplace.."
3230,1.0,"- Completely focuses on sales, nothing else. All that matters to them is hitting quarterly numbers. - High Churn of people due to lack of training, management and high pressured cooker demanding instant results. - Poor leadership in place - often people who have done well put into management positions with no exp or people skills. - Zero career development and growth. - No culture - you will just be another number. - Many people unresponsive and hiding. - Very political and packed with egos. - management seem to ignore and look down on more junior employees as beneath them. - Poor communication to employees."
3231,3.0,"Too many processes, not communicated consistently across the business - result most people are very busy - but not very productive! Looking to shoe horn acquired businesses into what are already broken core processes - consequence of which is frustration all round. Too much focus on trailhead and mandatory virtual learning, information overload and simply not enough hours in the day to get the job done. Compared to other enterprise software companies fewer class room based opportunities for learning. Painful on-boarding process, sink or swim. Surprising lack of resources. For many not a sustainable place to work."
3232,3.0,"Hired too many AE's. Made territories smaller and, as a result, less than a third of the AE's make their numbers."
3233,5.0,You need to keep the focus on balance between personal and work life. It is easy to get crazy when you start as a new employee because there is so much information and it is so easy to get it.
3234,4.0,"Shrinking patches make it harder to earn in some segments, its very much an american company with monthly targets , quarterly etc. Sometimes a bit over the top American vibe"
3235,4.0,lost the human touch and focus more on system
3236,3.0,Work load is more. Trying to balance the work and personal space is difficult.

3241,5.0,"At the moment i don't see particular cons except for the location, Dublin. If you like sales and you are competitive, this is the place for you"
3242,4.0,"- In some cases management has little interest in the careers of those below them - There doesn't seem to be much interest in hiring less experienced people (including co-ops) - Acquisitions need to be integrated in a faster manner, and don't let them think they will keep their own branding and processes for long - Because the company is so huge, you tend not to know what is going on in the rest of the organization"
3243,4.0,Growing quickly causes some pain
3244,5.0,"Not for the faint-hearted The sense of mission and associated demands will not be for everyone - be prepared to work hard. As the company gets larger and the product set gets wider, the resilience factor is increased. New employees need to be prepared to wait 9-12 months before things ""click""."
3245,5.0,Work can be extremely busy at times when preparing for the main events of the year: Salesforce World Tour Paris or Dreamforce.
3246,5.0,Fast Paced - if you are not used to a fast growing company this could be a challenge. Personally it has helped me thrive in the first 6 months and it motivates me to see the pace of growth and change
3247,4.0,forces benefit rules that don't always make sense.
3248,4.0,Becoming more corporate as the larger consultancies and service providers hemorrhage staff to Salesforce. But on the whole they tend to adopt the new culture.
3249,4.0,"Growth is sustained by carving territories for new reps. Frustrating to lose accounts you invest in, and need to drive bigger deals in reduced territory."
3250,5.0,"Its getting more complex, the change cycle is continuous, expecting to be selling something regardless of your role"
3251,3.0,"Lack of international market focus, Exec visits, investment, low standard marketing leadership roles that deal with politics more than actual work and delivery of progress. No action from top management."
3252,4.0,"Salesforce put a lot of Pressure on the account executives, territories are schrinking dramaticaly, not many AE achieve their quotas."
3253,3.0,"Politics, politics, politics. Pay increases ok but only if you started on the right amount. Tend to hire young, on a low salary and pretty soon falls way behind market value. Career paths for marketing non existent. Limited progression options. Top down approach. Hard to make a real impact from the bottom up. Need to wait for somebody senior to have the same idea or claim yours as their own. Hq driven. EMEA afterthought at best."
3254,4.0,Management politics significantly impact on the effectiveness of the organisation. Promotions and territory allocations are based on relationship instead of rep performance.
3255,5.0,Red tape in some processes
3256,4.0,"-Even though there's a general relaxed attitude, you can feel pressure coming from multiple and different fronts demanding results -There's a general trend in the whole company to not respect working hours or when someone is on holidays, and to demand replies to emails and actions even though people are not working -One of the two offices in Dublin, Central Park, could be severely improved: having a proper canteen with lunch and breakfast menus, more parking spaces, more desks (there are 120 desks for over 300 account executives), more meeting rooms... -Some decisions coming from the top management lately have been done, in my impression, with the sense of being improvised and without the sufficient transparency towards the rest of the organisation."
3257,5.0,Fast Growth can be harder to manage Limited parking places in the amsterdam office Have not Found too many disadvantages yet
3258,5.0,"Apart from the fact that the Dublin office isn't in a very central location, there is not a whole lot of negatives about the company."
3259,5.0,"Very intense, priorities often change too quickly."
3260,5.0,"With so many resources to access and great tools, Salesforce is highly process driven. The slight downside is that there is a need to maintain the personalised aspects of people management."
3261,5.0,They will make you work for the promotions. Example: you do 200% of your sales target and you're next in line for a promotion. Management will tap 3 people. You have now earned the right to interview for a promotion. You will be given a case study to present to senior directors. You will get beaten up in this meeting far beyond what any customer would put you through. At the end 1 of the 3 people will be selected to move up. The other 2 go back and wait until they are tapped again for a promotion. I watched a few friends depart due to not getting their promotion.
3262,3.0,"1. Pays less in accordance with same post in other firms 2. No joining bonus, salesforce doesn't have a culture of joining bonus 3. No company based cabs and even no reimbursement for daily travel 4. No gifts (atleast should give some gifts yearly or diwali)"
3263,2.0,Not the best leadership - extremely micromanaging and transactional.
3264,5.0,not enough time in the day to take it all in!!
3265,4.0,"The company is at something of a crossroads, wedded to some of the disadvantages of its start-up mentality: thinking can be short-term, with decisions accordingly myopic, and there is too great a value placed on the diving-catch. Too many fire-drills and a small number of capricious senior leaders who have been around for 10 - 15 years behaving in the same way. It is tiresome, disruptive and frankly counter-cultural but their tenure appears to make them untouchable."
3266,5.0,None that exist so far
3267,5.0,"As the company is quite young, there are not necessarily processes in place which can sometimes make things challenging, especially when it come to career development however, the lack of process gives employees the opportunity to build their own processes and own their own career."
3268,5.0,Nothing to say any cons about this company as far as I feel comfort and greate place to work I think it would be better in future
3269,4.0,Can be disorganised at times
3270,5.0,Management is wishy washy & indecisive.
3271,3.0,If you are a woman you will spend years trying to break through the extremely tight knit boys club. What makes it even harder is the PR about women completely contradicts the experience of many women who work here. The boys network will actively exclude women and block them as they fear they will do a better job. Mostly male leadership teams and now great women are leaving and being replaced by men.
3272,5.0,If you're not in San Francisco as an engineer or product manager you are far away from decisions and other options within the company.
3273,5.0,"Salesforce is not for everyone - cultural fit is essential. I would recommend that you investigate what makes Salesforce different in our Ohana Trailhead badge. If it resonates with you, then join in!"
3274,5.0,"** Only meant for Dublin office * Don't mistake it for real Salesforce Almost negligible engineering presence. Very little to share and learn for engineering and software development. All kind of games being played as small number of staff wants to push into management. There's a huge hierarchy and it may be good on a global scale. But doesn't quite makes sense to have that in Dublin office. Some people are stuck in monotonous work and see move to management their only way out and act in poor spirit. If you are looking for good work and team, don't bother. Join a startup instead. Current state of Dublin office is worse than that. If it wasn't for larger organisation holding it to a structure, the place had been much more chaotic"
3275,5.0,I like my job very much

3283,5.0,"none, i love it :)"
3284,5.0,Can't think about any yet.
3285,5.0,"-Reduced work-life balance due to bi-monthly business travels required to identify opportunities to build pipeline -Geographical distance from customers who are based in country -Growing sales teams means accounts per AE getting fewer with the targets not getting smaller -""Flexforce"" no seats assigned to AE -Weekly forecasting with monthly forecasts might not be suitable to everyone"
3286,5.0,"Challenges that arise when a company is growing in rapid space, having said that CXO takes excellent measures to minimize the same."
3287,2.0,"Failure in execution of vision and values at middle management If you're non-sales, you often get left out of company events / initiatives Promotion criteria (if actually issued) not followed consistently Constant expectation to do more with less Silos are everywhere - it's all about who you actually know and have a relationship with in other teams / functions if you want to find out what's happening / get anything done EMEA and APAC teams in support functions are an after thought - everything revolves around HQ and US Don't expect a work / life balance if you live in a time zone more than 2 hours different to San Francisco"
3288,5.0,"Salesforce is a global business with San Fran HQ. Working the timezones can be challenging sometimes, but this is also met with flexibility elsewhere."
3289,5.0,Always need to be switched on (great in a way)
3290,5.0,dublin office is far from city center so nothing to do near by
3291,4.0,night shifts support work long hours
3292,5.0,I cannot think of any.
3293,4.0,Not aligned to competitors when it comes to salaries.
3294,4.0,Release cadence of Core (3 times a year) is forced on the rest of the company even if it doesn't make sense for the product you're on. Forced to dogfood our own internal project management software (GUS) which only maintained by a very small team. Open headcount is distributed blindly to projects that are stack-ranked in priority and there's not much to go around after the top 2 or 3 start hiring.
3295,4.0,"Big company, so tend to lose the buzz or excitement that one gets from smaller start-ups. Can be a little political at times."
3296,3.0,As with many US based firms many of the mangers I had were based in the US. Most have zero idea on life in EMEA both business and culturally as they never got on a plane and been bothered to come here. This made them some of the most ignorant and useless people managers I have had the misfortune to work for and sadly nothing the UK management team could change or influence. If you join one of the companies which SFDC has taken over then good luck. It can take years for systems to join up and merged and this can lead to a huge duplication of effort and time. I did see some people make some good money here but lots running around chasing completely unattainable sales targets year after year. They seemed caught up in the hype rather than making money. Despite telling everyone that there are lots of career opportunities in the UK I did not see many at all. Again your career will be down to knowing the chosen three of four people within the business who can help you to get there. It seems like a long and tiresome process. Many of the management have come from the same background and company and this management style does show sadly. A few but not all where rude and unaaproachable despite constantly telling the company of their open door policy. Mark B is a charasmiatic leader and I wonder who would fill his large shoes once he departs.
3297,1.0,Where do I start . The only management in the Dublin office is a disgrace to salesforce and PARDOT. horrible person who rules with fear and causes more problems for everybody in PARDOT. But is protected from higher management. Over the last 2 years 70% of PARDOT employees quit and yet the company and management do nothing .
3298,2.0,Way to many execs in territories and greedy obsession with growth now means only 20% of highly talented execs make their targets. Territories are simply too small and the constant pressure isn't helping.
3299,5.0,"very few cons. You have to like change as it is a very fast growing company, and the pace of work can be challenging for some."
3300,1.0,Where to start.. The management alone is shocking. No leaders at all. Idea of leading a team is trying to trip then up and bully tactics. Egos come to play and there is allot of clicks in this business. If you not in the click you won't get promoted. What I really mean is if you don't do as they say and jump when they want.... You won't go anywhere. It's a real shame as the company based in the US where there is culture and values is not the same in the Dublin office. Management are doing you no justice as several people won't even apply for jobs as the word on the street in Dublin is there is one manager now promoted to a higher position who no one wants to work FOR. What happened to working with a company to succeed. But seems she is also untouchable as her click is supporting her. Real shame as in Dublin word spreads. Dublin office and managers in there are too far from the real culture of the company and the US Aren't getting the real story.
3301,4.0,Career progression and limited annual increases.

3305,5.0,should no give up some markets
3306,4.0,"Salesforce is a selling machine, in managing a sales team you work within specified parameters and having an influence on strategy isn't really an option. You're there to execute only."

3317,5.0,"you need to understand the culture to navigate your career, not always completely transparent"
3318,1.0,"Technically, the company is lackluster, yet has drunk it's own kool-aid, believing itself to be innovative. User interface is implemented with a proprietary framework (Aura) that is universally criticized by its users as inferior to Aspect and other industry standards, but is ferociously defended by company insiders. Similarly, storage is done via a proprietary layer atop a small number of massive Oracle databases. This means that one database outage affects a large number of customers. The Oracle centric mindset of the ""old boys"" has been incredibly resistant to change. Unit testing is slowly gaining acceptance, but is still by far the exception to the rule. The monolithic nature of the code base means that tests may take several days to catch regressions. Somehow, mediocrity and risk aversion have become the norm, perhaps due to the senior management blaming failures on the very staff who are doing more than the minimum possible, and are therefore ""visible""."
3319,3.0,Culture in the Netherlands. fast growth in people with different backgrounds and culture is hard to create an local culture.
3320,1.0,"Degration – Bulling – Favouritism – on a daily. No consideration for their peolpe – pay homage to people via money. No care or humanity shown. An appealing manifestation of how mediocrity wins out. All managment are arrogant and under skilled both form a sales coaching perspective and employee management perspective. Look into al there backgrounds in advance of joining. They all have had V/limited experience out side SFDC. Categorically - worst place I have ever worked. Made significant sums of money net monthly 30 / 40 K on occasions, and still left!!!!!"
3321,5.0,Long hours and travel mean time away from family . Flexible working hours and remote location working helps . Room to grow in channel is limited
3322,5.0,"Political, which is a given with the growth; middle management do not receive training in managing people and are often on power trips (likely based on insecurity); territories are far from equal and the company will double up territories for those they want to promote to make them look good and justify the promotion; too many people eg overlays, excessive levels of management trying to justify why they are employed and create a lot of extra work for AE's; takes away from selling and caring for the customers. Too much 'AE Enablement'...AE's are now Customer Success, Technical Support, Operations, Sales Engineers as instead of hiring resources, everyone wants to train AE's to do their job...not a good use of high paid employees and takes away from productivity and revenue driving activities. As AE's you are pretty much seen as a number and stat to 'stay in the box' without a lot of autonomy on how to spend your day. Lots of burnout if you get sucked into the monthly 'life or death' culture to meet quota or be ashamed."
3323,5.0,Nothing yet. I expect that it's not like a traditional large company and hopefully the teams are allowed to have autonomy

They will assign more work to you and during appraisal telgu employee will get more hike % , stocks, promotion everything and a non-telgu guy have to listen blame and bad feedback. They will sideline you in all aspect. 3. You can't raise your concern to the HR or ethics department because there also telgu management and at the end they will prove that you are wrong. 4. Managers and Recruiters will highly exploit the employee Referral program . They will only refer and hire there known person to add more Telgu person in the team.

Eg Associate SEs are meant to only shadow and support builds, but often do their own demos from month 3, and are forced to stay as 'Associates' for min 2 years until they are ""eligible"" for promotion. Would recommend coming in as Senior SE or above. Internal promotes get much much less than the external market rate.

3534,3.0,"Salesforce donates 1 percent of its software, 1 percent of its equity, and 1 percent of its employees' time to pay it forward. As a result, Salesforce has topped a list of workplaces that give back."

Also, they are NOT EVEN PROVIDED A CAB RIDE TO HOME with a security personnel - a practice which is followed even by smaller companies where women leave late at night from the office. This is a clear indication of denigration. Please stay away from such US-based firms, especially Salesforce, Bangalore"

3582,1.0,"Start up inside Salesforce - Huge workloads - Whitespace Role very few customers in UKI- CEO of your own business a line used by hiring manager during interview - No support for AEs - Toxic Culture from top down. Revolving door. Not a secure job. Teams are understaffed and badly managed, No marketing support - expectations are AEs will create and advertise own events. Very few resellers signed up in public sector space making it impossible to answer tenders."

3588,4.0,Not much except for wfh making it less interAction with the team.
3589,1.0,"Rampant bullying and aggressive toxic behaviour in sales that's never called to account if numbers are being made, even if reported. Ineffectual managers who are far more concerned for saving face and managing their ""brands"". A terrible product strategy reliant on trying to cobble together disperate solutions that don't work together. Marketing superseeds actual product engineering and delivery. Good luck trying to move internally. Don't believe the marketing around culture and the great place to work results! Talk to any former employee to get the truth."

Compensation barely on-par with Deloitte, etc. - Employees bombarded with too much information via multiple channels - Too many unwarranted acquisitions (Professional Services). Salesforce acquires Tier-III service companies for no apparent reason.

3622,5.0,None that I can think of
3623,1.0,"Definitely one of the worst decisions of my life. You’d expect a company like Salesforce to have a smooth process. But here’s the real story- My onboarding and interview was an absolute nightmare. This was my dream company, so obviously when I received an offer from them, I accepted it, even if it meant taking a huge pay cut. These guys would leverage Salesforce US culture into talking you down for salaries but would say shamelessly that Salesforce has a transparent pay scale. When I entered the company, I found out that I was the least paid employee in the team. Anyhoo, I accepted the offer and it was their turn to send laptop and other peripherals. Well they didn’t, their procurement team never replied, not on slack, not on calls, not anywhere and I had to bring senior management into this. Well after 15 days of joining, I had received the laptop but mind you even though you don’t have your company phone or company laptop, they’ll start evaluating your performance from day 1, because dude you are in Business Development. So you gotta be an Einstien and a God maybe to do 500 billion things at one time and managers even then would find a way to complain. They expect us to work for 10 hours every day, attend useless meetings, and work like a machine without taking a breath. And they’ll preach about the helping culture of Salesforce, lol. The AEs don’t respond on time, hell even the managers themselves don’t respond until you ping them again and again. And they want us to feel gratitude for the company bevause it pays salary. They have 0 empathy for their employees, they turn deaf ear to our problems. I am suffocating here but I can’t teach out to anyone because guess what everyone is the same. This is a typical employee exploiting company which has created a bubble of a good work culture. PS- this is just for India. I have some friends in the US team of Salesforce and they are having their best time."
3624,5.0,Can feel a little anonymous as it's grown so much
3625,5.0,Work overload due to high growth
3626,3.0,"However, the recent years' experience was more like a 2-3 star company. The culture is definitely not the same anymore. All the decisions are top-down. Some of the leaders don't even have domain knowledge. The culture became very political. Promotions were very unfairly done. No career band framework at all. People being overworked and dragged into political plays. You can't be your authentic self anymore, but have to wear a mask to work everyday coz your boss need you to be 'perfect'."

3635,5.0,I haven't discovered any cons
3636,4.0,Growth might be slow. Very large organisation also means customers might feel smaller companies can pay more attention to them
3637,5.0,Fast-moving nature of tech can make disconnecting from work more challenging
3638,5.0,Growing pains and process gaps abound with an increasingly wide footprint.
3639,4.0,1 - company is growing rapidly so things are constantly changed 2 - a lot of ambiguity around goals (per team) 3 - constant change in leadership 4 - when working with global teams you will find yourself working late/early hours 5 - lack of clear communication around true priorities. Everything seems urgent and high priority to leaders.
3640,5.0,There are no drawbacks to working at Salesforce!
3641,5.0,Working remote can be challenging
3642,5.0,- The org is primarily located in Utah and Boston. SF recruits are bound to have no in-person team gatherings - Legacy tech stack
3643,5.0,"It can be a little over the top liberal, but I like how they want to contribute to society."
3644,3.0,So big. Easy to be a cog. Everyone is a cog. Unending volume of stuff.
3645,3.0,Too many people to coordinate activities.
3646,5.0,Very big company. So some decisions are made at the higher level with no input from time engineers or individual contributors
3647,5.0,Not a real downside but something to note is that while working you have autonomy over your day to day actions. So just make sure you can motivate yourself and create your own structure. Also SF is big on building your own brand so you need to take ownership of your brand and put yourself out there for exposure and advancement in your career.
3648,5.0,Commute for me was a little too much.
3649,3.0,"-The company is still stuck in a market based compensation model, but they're not even in line with their current markets. They have yet to adapt like other big tech firms. -There are people placed in high level(SVP & EVP) positions who have little, to no, experience in the organizations and the impact is present by the mass exodus of tenured individuals. -The politics are some of the worst I've ever experienced. If you know people who have, or currently do work here, ask around."

3661,5.0,"While this is being worked on, promotions and factors around money are kept weirdly secretive compared to other big tech companies. Stocks and compensation are great for new hires, but they don't invest as much in retaining talent."
3662,2.0,"You're just a number Sell everything you can, even if the customer doesn't need it Customer Success is just an industry term as SF, but no real meaning behind it Political and social beliefs are paramount - if you don't fall in line then don't bother"

3678,1.0,"Culture too political, all based on who you know"
3679,2.0,"Your Account Executives control your destiny. I came in as an outside hire for the first 4 months in the role my Account Executives had no time for me to learn about their accounts, what their goals were and wouldn't let me into their key accounts to help set meetings. This affects my KPI's and was expected to perform with little to no direction. It's radio silent in my 1:1s and was asked to come up with points of view into their new logo accounts. They don't utilize their BDRs correctly and believe were supposed to research all of their new logo accounts and come in with a step by step plan. How am I supposed to do this with no knowledge or direction on any of the products or goals? I've been told by other reps that you have to internally sell you AE's on why things should be opportunities. It's very gamey and if you don't know how to play it...you're in for a rough ride."
3680,5.0,"Definitely can feel pressure at times to overwork - Not overtly from leadership, but there is a hustle mentality"
3681,3.0,"If you don't find the right mgmt team I find it to be a ""Never Good Enough Environment"" where doing right by the customer is under valued."
3682,4.0,Poor stock options Over compensation is not competitive for Software Engineering

3691,5.0,None! Was recruited for another position elsewhere which is why I left. It was a hard decision!
3692,2.0,"The promotion system is broken. Period. Only promoting 1-3% of your workforce every 6 months is a broken process and gives over-perfoming employees two options if they don't get promoted that round - wait and see, or move into a new role within the company at the higher title. Or, the route I took, leave the company. I understand putting a cap on the amount of promotions each team can have, but it can cause teammates to have to wait YEARS for a promotion they should have just been given. And finally, ""Ohana"" is BS in my opinion when it comes to those in leadership. Those not in leadership totally embody that spirit, but the amount of politics, backstabbing and egotistical leaders in this company is unacceptable. When you disagree with someone who doesn't understand your job but is in a leadership role, you are punished, get duties you enjoy doing taken away from you, and told to make things better without any guidance on what is actually broken. Salary is also way under in comparison to other companies. Salesforce used to be at the top of salary ranges, and have unfortunately not kept up with the times. Every year the employee survey continually highlights these issues, and now with some of the top employees in the company moving on to greener pastures, I really hope they tackle these problems. It starts from the top."
3693,4.0,Salesforce likes to innovate through acquisitions rather than engineering
3694,1.0,"- Reorg every year. I completed 3.5 years at salesforce and on my 5th manager - Middle management is extremely corrupt and there is favoritism all around. If you do not suck up to middle management, you will not grow at Salesforce - Seniors dating and marrying their direct reports (which explains the favoritism above) - There is no feedback loop for employees to provide their feedback to upper management. It all goes through middle management which is itself corrupt"
3695,3.0,These cons are specific to the HR Department. Other teams seemed to have been functioning ok. No work like balance Overwhelming stress Leadership is not responsive to feedback/needs of the team Low morale Micromanaging Low pay with a lot of work Not rewarding or promotion/career growth opportunities
3696,5.0,Honestly cannot think of any cons that are worth mentioning. Its just a good company and a lovely place to work.

3698,5.0,The demands can be very stressful and burdensome
3699,4.0,Fast growth with acquisitions provide some pain points
3700,5.0,"It feels more like a lottery with the accounts you receive to work. Some people do nothing and make tons, while others work very hard and make little."
3701,5.0,Better pay elsewhere and promotion process can be irritating
3702,2.0,not a good work life balance
3703,5.0,There are stupid middle managers everywhere
3704,4.0,Salesforce historically has higher quotas With Salesforce being the #1 CRM you are expected to perform at your best everyday.
3705,4.0,"- The senior leadership and some of the middle leaders in this department clearly does not align with Salesforce as a company. We sit in employee town halls discussing flex time and working from home, but the leadership in this department wants to micro manage their teams and press their thumbs down on everyone. This department has been watered down so much in the last several years and we constantly hear about how we need to ""lower the cost to serve"" while also trying to shove case closures down everyone's throats."
3706,5.0,Bachelor's degree required for entry-level
3707,3.0,politics jungle may be technically stagnant
3708,5.0,"Some of the processes can be a bit opaque, I am not always clear on what training is required and what isn't. Also, salary structure could be more transparent."
3709,5.0,"Mergers and acquisitions are exciting, but lead to constant change. Agility is required here! :)"
3710,5.0,Not enough prospects know the real power and value of Salesforce Industries
3711,5.0,Intense sales environment lots of org change
3712,5.0,"tech stack is not popular, you can barely use it outside of Salesforce"
3713,4.0,- Very demanding - Nonrewarding - Work/life balance - High turnover
3714,4.0,Hard to progress you career here. Every takes 2-3 years in each role. Lame for motivated people who can have opportunity to grab big roles.
3715,4.0,"stock refresher sucks , no guarantees on every year refresh 401K match only upto 5K per year Low developer productivity due to multiple security checks and processes"
3716,4.0,"Lack of management, not good at training new hires"
3717,1.0,Lower than industry avg pay Commission structure only benefits Salesforce Territories are super saturated with under utilized shelf ware Management is on a 1-year campaign tour if best - very transactional culture No territory ownership by your co-primes who just wait for you to usher in the c-level intros Super political - and not just Marc’s outspoken political stance Get ready to google yourself to knowledge as the onboarding is atrocious and entirely virtual
3718,5.0,The culture is amazing but a little cultural misappropriation
3719,3.0,Pressure to spin every campaign into a positive Culture is to do right by executives rather than the customer Very resistant to outside the box ideas
3720,3.0,Job satisfaction depends heavily on the org and team you are on…
3721,4.0,"Long hours sometimes, but needed in any company."
3722,3.0,Work-life balance can be better
3723,5.0,None so far( have worked for 4 years)
3724,4.0,Workload is larger than expected
3725,5.0,None I can think of
3726,5.0,Can be a demanding and stressful job at times
3727,5.0,Extremely busy given high growth Meeting heavy culture
3728,4.0,"-Depending on your management in IT, you will either get a innovative leader, or a leader stuck in old school metric driven decision making with disassociation their workers -IT process and metrics are micromanaged at times, especially on remote support during the pandemic -Talent retention with contractors during the pandemic has been abysmal"
3729,4.0,Big company so lots of politics
3730,2.0,"- Leaders aren't receptive to suggestions or feedback - Salary is not competitive - Limited enablement - As with most enterprise companies, territories are small"
3731,4.0,"Started in the business development associate role, then SDR, then BDR, then AE and the process took around 2.5 years to get into a closing role"
3732,2.0,"Base pay is terrible. I was promoted to AE and got an 8% raise. I share that with a teammate of mine, and I found out she makes that already. Can be a thankless job. You are not a sales rep. You set meetings for your ae’s. You must call a ton a day, email a ton a day, and management is on you about metrics. If you take pto you have to make up the emails and calls. When you interview for promotions, you get no relief from your metrics so you can’t prepare."
3733,5.0,None at this point of employment
3734,5.0,It is a big company and sometimes there are so many moving parts and lots of people involved to do small task.
3735,5.0,Inheritance tax return to your account
3736,4.0,Some poor management. Lots of attrition. The work's not particularly interesting and the developer experience of working on platform is painful at times
3737,5.0,No cons at this time
3738,5.0,Did not find any Cons to talk about
3739,5.0,I've had wonderful leaders at Salesforce and leaders who had a lot to learn. Look for teams with leaders you trust and admire for the best experience.
3740,5.0,"I am not going to sugar coat it, onboarding and finding your sea legs once you have your territory, in a remote environment is REALLY TOUGH. You will feel lost at times, and wonder how you are going to hit any quota. There are so many resources available for anything you are trying to do that it can seem overwhelming; the phrase everyone repeats when you start is ""its like drinking from a firehose"", which I brushed off initially, because what job worth doing is easy to get started in? but they mean it, and you should believe it. SOOO much info is pumped into your brain when you start, it seems nearly impossible to grasp everything. The comp plan is wildly complicated, so you really have to take the time to understand how you make money so you can focus your efforts appropriately."
3741,5.0,i do not have any cons
3742,3.0,Salesforce is a large company with many layers Knowing leadership and getting on their good side matters the most for promotions It's extremely important that you get staffed on a tier 1 client - visibility and career progression
3743,4.0,"- The better you are at networking and being outgoing, the farther you can go. - It is an intensely sales-focused culture, and that can be frustrating if you want to contribute but don't aspire to be a salesperson. - Working with senior executives is hit or miss. Some are amazingly supportive. - - Others are bogged down and distracted due to top-down pressure from the President's Committee. - The closer your orbit is to the company's top executives the, more stressful you life is likely to be."
3744,5.0,Not the best job for everyone
3745,5.0,"Just like any sales role there are a lot of moving parts and different procedures that you need to learn quickly, but they provide so many resources and everyone is so helpful that its not a problem"
3746,4.0,Compensation needs to be more competitive in order to retain top talen.
3747,2.0,"If you are doing work on the Core product, it can be frustrating, as it is a massive Java monolith. I believe there is a culture problem within the management ranks of the Digital Engagement division. SF promotes ""trust"" as their number one core value, but from what I experienced, certain individuals at the middle management level in this division of the company seem to embrace the opposite of that value, leading to an adversarial, rather than cooperative, relationship between teams."
3748,5.0,Big company so it can be challenging keeping up with all the new additions You better be someone that actually likes (and embraces) change. It is a constant over here.
3749,5.0,No cons so far that I can think of.
3750,5.0,sometimes had to work long hours
3751,4.0,- very large - compensation - equity refresh is uncommon
3752,5.0,Big companies can run decisions slow - sometimes takes time to approve certain projects
3753,4.0,Too political Too preachy Viewpoint discrimination - conservatives are in the closet Too many high salaried people that were hired to make the higher management look more diverse
3754,3.0,Rapid growth has caused ill equipped managers to promote too quickly and this has damaged the culture.
3755,1.0,"They think they have a good culture when really it's just a cult. Most people being brought in act like everyone should get a trophy and most frontline manager are feckless, political, little people with a true talent of thinking themselves as mini benioffs. It's really quite disgusting."
3756,5.0,"Salesforce is a big company that has been around for a while and with that comes less agility and more fixing tech debt, etc."
3757,5.0,Meeting sales goals and forecasting are an important part of the sales organization.
3758,4.0,Nothing much to say it was ok

3763,5.0,I don't have any. It's a great place to work.
3764,5.0,"I spend a significant amount of time troubleshooting source control, build, and test tools, which are often very slow. This doesn't seem to be unusual for large enterprise codebases, however, and the company has started making developer productivity a major priority."
3765,4.0,High pressure and ever increasing work load with low salary raises in same title
3766,5.0,no cons so far great place to work
3767,5.0,no personal chef available lol
3768,4.0,- low pay & terrible territory distribution
3769,1.0,Team collaboration is the worst I’ve ever experienced.
3770,5.0,Scale is slowing innovations...need to figure out how to do both.
3771,5.0,"Long learning curve, very complex and diverse company and business"
3772,5.0,i have no cons on the job
3773,5.0,"Long hours, company bonding, hard work"
3774,5.0,Big Company - That can be good or bad depending on your role.
3775,5.0,"High stress, not much PTO."
3776,5.0,Nothing outside of what you typically run across in corporate America
3777,4.0,"Must be able to fully drink the cultural Kool-aide, however I don't think SF realizes that a lot of customers don't want to be so political and would rather the software just work and be easier use etc."
3778,4.0,"team politics, no free lunch"
3779,4.0,"fast paced, compensation could be a little better to keep up with market"
3780,3.0,"Poor employee incentives after your hired, negotiate when coming in because challenging otherwise."
3781,5.0,"The recruiter I worked with wasn't great, and the interview process was awkward. Lots of change, constantly - I've already had a couple different managers in my 6 months here."
3782,5.0,Build process can be slow
3783,5.0,Salary not in pace with FAANG
3784,5.0,"There are not many downsides. The culture is really open and accepting. They are very accommodating to the needs of their employees, and they earn a significant degree of loyalty in return. Because this is such a great company, many people are willing to go the extra mile to keep this good thing going. There may be some mild challenges in terms of managing the culture internally, and ensuring that every group feels included, and part of the Salesforce family. Still, our leader ship clearly spends a lot of time focusing on the correct approach here, and ensuring that there are enough opportunities for people to connect with like minded coworkers, and to ensure that they are recognized and appreciated."
3785,5.0,Some metrics are a little out of reach
3786,5.0,Can be fast-paced at times.
3787,5.0,Everything in management last year
3788,4.0,high stress salary pay low
3789,4.0,- Technology updates every 6 months - Must be able to Adapt - Could be overwhelming if you're not tech savvy.
3790,4.0,Large company and team sizes
3791,1.0,"It's a shame that Glassdoor doesn't do a better job of filtering out fake reviews. A majority of reviews on here for Salesforce are fake, written by bots, and created by Salesforce themselves. In reality, this is an absolutely horrible place to work. You will be thrown into a meat grinder with unrealistic expectations pushed on you, and virtually no training or guidance when you start. You'll realize in a few short weeks that coming to this company was the absolute worst decision you've ever made in your life, and that reading reviews on this website are causing people to destroy their lives by coming to this company. It's all an illusion. The culture is horrible and toxic. You'll be chewed up and spit out without remorse. DO NOT COME TO THIS COMPANY!!! DO NOT BELIEVE THE FAKE REVIEWS!!!"
3792,5.0,I can't think of too many cons.
3793,5.0,A lot of internal reorg
3794,3.0,Everything is dependent on territory and they tend to put you in a non-performing territory if you are new to the team.
3795,5.0,I can't think of any.
3796,2.0,Was bullied and harassed and it wrecked my mental health. HR (ES and EthicsPoint) and UX leadership was aware but I received no help and was expected to continue working with a known bully. On a long road to recovery to get my mental health back.
3797,5.0,Could not think of any cons
3798,5.0,Salesforce is a very large company and integrating all of its acquired companies has been a bit challenging.
3799,5.0,There aren't any. I came back as a boomerang in less than 3 weeks
3800,5.0,No cons working at Salesforce
3801,5.0,Pay is way too low

3803,5.0,Some teams can be over working
3804,5.0,I have not encountered any real cons to this point.
3805,5.0,"It can be a bit unnerving sometimes if you don't have an entrepreneurial spirit inside of you. There is a lot of opportunity, but you have to be a bit of a self driver to take full advantage."
3806,5.0,"Good work culture and awesome team but with so many changes all the time, tough to keep up"
3807,5.0,"Sometimes slow moving, decisions can be hard to make stick"
3808,5.0,This company could step up its marketing for its current employees - lot of budget cuts
3809,5.0,"This is a challenge, not a con, but there is a wealth of knowledge at your fingertips, thus it can be overwhelming to navigate all the integrated tools."
3810,5.0,-Great option as a gateway to a sales career but you have to wait 3-4 years before reaching AE role if you start as an SDR.
3811,5.0,Pay is below average for a mule developer
3812,5.0,Non. Everyone seemed to be very friendly
3813,5.0,"The sales culture is sometimes a little bro-y, but I've not had any overt racism or sexism The organization is getting older and adopting more bureaucracy, but it's not an insurmountable red tape amount"
3814,4.0,"While quick pivots and adaptation are a strength of Salesforce, particularly Marketing, the frequency of change can also be its greatest weakness. I have had a higher than average number of managers, been through multiple reorgs, served multiple CMOs and GMs, and rewritten marketing plans multiple times a year. This puts strain on high performing teams to always deliver better results amidst constant ambiguity."
3815,4.0,Politically active and biased which turns off some customers.
3816,4.0,-Working in core can be sluggish
3817,4.0,lots of turnover on some teams
3818,4.0,Pace of innovation is slower than could be
3819,5.0,Unrealistic demands and pressure the last two weeks of very month!
3820,5.0,No cons at this time
3821,5.0,Your success will depend on these 3 factors in this particular order: 1. Territory 2. Timing 3. Talent Your territory patch will determine how successful you are at Salesforce. As an external hire you will not start with a good territory for your first year. Pay is also much lower compared to competitors.
3822,4.0,"- large company, easy to get lost"
3823,5.0,"Growth into senior executive level positions, VP and above, is often limited to internal leadership. These levels are recruited outside Salesforce and are recruits who are former Salesforce employees or at other organizations."
3824,5.0,Need to stand out with hard work
3825,5.0,- territories can sometimes be rough
3826,5.0,No cons to speak of at this time

3835,5.0,- Moves fast - Doesn't have stock options
3836,5.0,None that I can think of.
3837,4.0,Constant reorganization. Pretty political in senior roles. Acquire innovation rather than sponsoring it
3838,4.0,"With 70K+ employees, it's just another huge company- the heart of the culture is missing."

3847,5.0,Too much information to consume and implement in planning
3848,5.0,Hitting quota can be affected by few large deals vs many smaller deals - all depending on your territory
3849,5.0,Still trying to find something I don't like.
3850,5.0,Career growth opportunities can be limited Large Company Environment Overhead/Bureaucracy
3851,5.0,Promotion process is lengthly. need to engage quickly
3852,4.0,"Management centric, less technical growth, wasting time on bad process,"
3853,4.0,Too big of a company. Lost it's core. Too many changes in structure... feels like IBM
3854,1.0,"no control over the majority of your metrics, and therefore no control over your promotion timeline. You spend the majority of the day copying and pasting from linkedin to the org, your promotion is based on your meeting metric which is all about the BDRs performances not yours, as well as headcount which is also out of your control."
3855,5.0,Gets very corporate at times and re-orgs are happening more frequently
3856,5.0,Sales people are treated like hired guns. Few raises. Stock grants are rare. “You get compensated with commissions “
3857,5.0,sales is tough--get used to it
3858,5.0,Will take as much of your time as you'll give it...often without recognition for extra efforts. Lots of time and energy on big events that feel like oversized pep rallys. Can be moved around like an interchangeable part.
3859,5.0,"Rapid Growth, loose management structure"
3860,5.0,Have not found anything I dont like
3861,5.0,Nothing I can think of

3864,5.0,I Haven’t found anything yet.
3865,5.0,no cons from my standpoint

3867,4.0,Lots of orgs and the product is older
3868,4.0,Work life balance could be interesting
3869,4.0,"Due to size and growth, it's very difficult to make an impact in the middle ranks. Politics are hard to navigate. While top leaders (Marc Benioff and Brett Taylor) demonstrate the fun of the culture and sincere dedication to core values, I can't say the same about middle management. A great place to start your career or have a VP or above role."
3870,2.0,"The founder is a bully, unable or unwilling to listen to leaders or employees. Managers live in fear of “what would Marc say,” and Marc changes his mind constantly. They talk a really good game but they’re not nearly the altruistic place they want us to believe. It’s really hard to grow."
3871,4.0,"Because everyone wants to work for Salesforce, our sales metrics are very difficult to hit. You can make a good salary with commission but it is rare to hit that because they make our KPIs more difficult to hit than other sales companies do. And if you don’t like it, then no worries- there will be 100 people waiting for you to leave so they can take your spot. Employees stay for the benefits, not the pay."
3872,5.0,Only thing I will say is the hiring process is slow due to checks and balances on equality etc
3873,5.0,Nothing I can think of
3874,4.0,Slower career growth. Promotion is really manager and org dependent
3875,3.0,"Executive turnover rate, the internal instance of the product"

3877,5.0,"Some folks in the leadership positions are self-serving and misuse their position to steal complete-credit from their subordinates, while pretending to be people leaders."
3878,5.0,Not many come to mind
3879,3.0,"No growth, long hours, shady management"
3880,3.0,Career growth is very challenging.
3881,5.0,"Sink or swim mentality can make it hard to move up , sales seems to hire outside of the company and moving up is hard within the org unless you have a fruitful customer base and numbers to show for. It’s not gonna cut it having a good personality and referral- you have to show them the money , literally."
3882,5.0,- Work life balance can be a challenge at times ( however very typical for high performing sales orgs )
3883,5.0,Very large company that could be intimidating for some.
3884,5.0,"I find it less socially satisfying to work remotely, but this is just the way things are these days. It also has many advantages. But I do miss the connections you make when you work for a small company."
3885,5.0,New to company and cannot opine now

3889,4.0,Large company can be hard to navigate
3890,5.0,small territories for account executives

3892,4.0,No cons to share as of yet.
3893,4.0,- slow software development cycle because of enterprise customers.
3894,4.0,Workforce is increasing year over year & it's not great for recently acquired companies
3895,4.0,"Became increasingly corporate. I liked the small company I joined; and didn't love the one that I left. The leaders I loved are gone. As a sales leader, work/life balance is tough."

3903,4.0,Not much career development you have to be your own boss and carve the path for your next steps
3904,3.0,"High Highs and Low Lows, underpaid (received one pay raise in 5 years), culture is meh especially during remote work, teammates can be hit or miss, if you're in sales you're stuck with your accounts which can be good or bad, a lot of it you can't directly impact"

3909,5.0,Dont know yet To be updated
3910,5.0,"The ramp up is pretty steep and takes serious effort. The internal libraries documentation is a little lacking. For better or worse, I end up spending quite some time reading / running code to learn the ropes. Thankfully the code base is good quality in my opinion. On the functional side, taking many training modules on Trailhead slowly gave me a picture of our offerings."
3911,5.0,Fast moving company acquiring new products. Constantly learning and yea hung sales how to position new products
3912,5.0,No cons for my current position.
3913,5.0,I believe I am underpaid in this market (100k base + 10% bonus)
3914,5.0,you are worked an used as a machine part

3918,3.0,Too big to advance. Hard to grow your career
3919,3.0,People are hired in or promoted into incorrect jobs. Working with acquisitions is tough.
3920,2.0,"learn how to network, otherwise your career is stagnant"
3921,2.0,Front line management are the most feckless/worthless/stupid people I've ever come across. All they care about is politics and looking good for themselves and promoting their people. Yes the 'good ole boy' network has new clothes but it still very much exists.
3922,5.0,None! Was recruited for another position elsewhere which is why I left. It was a hard decision!
3923,4.0,need to negotiate salary each year
3924,3.0,Pay is not what it should be. Promotions/raises are too structured.
3925,5.0,Odd hours but not too bad
3926,5.0,"Sometimes upper management makes less than ideal decisions without consulting the front-line workers, but this is hardly unique to Salesforce."
3927,4.0,Very demanding - while WLB is talked about - work load and expectations do not lend itself to balanced life style.
3928,5.0,Core AE's - 2 years min in role to get promoted

3933,5.0,It's a big company with many levels of management
3934,5.0,None at this very moment.
3935,5.0,"Constant change and innovation... which means processes are in constant flux. There are so many programs, and training opportunities that it's easy to get distracted. Onboarding at the team level is somewhat unstructured, but its getting better (and I am helping.)"
3936,5.0,Trying to find some. Still looking hard.
3937,5.0,Difficulty to find ways to stand out
3938,5.0,No cons I could think of
3939,4.0,stress level can be very high
3940,4.0,Growing quickly Lack of transparency internally Not very competitive salary before commission Hard to move up
3941,4.0,In certain areas of the company it is difficult to get promoted. If you get a bad patch it could take you 2.5 years to get promoted when it might only take someone else 1 year. The pay is good but again depending on your patch you could be making the minimum or be making 250% more then your coworkers
3942,4.0,"- the promotion process is very bureaucratic and - adjust salaries based on the ""cost of talent,"" which is a moot point in a remote ""work from anywhere"" world. - A lot of swirl causes work to become redudant"
3943,3.0,"Deliverables are aggressively demanded at the last minute with a hard impending deadline but there is no clarity on what the project itself is or any of the basic logistics necessary to move forward on it. Many of these details are dependent on higher ranking people's opinions and communication, which do not come down through the ranks until much too late in the process, causing extreme stress and anxiety for everyone involved (including external partners and customers). A very reactive culture rather than preventative or retrospective. No clear upward trajectory path in general."
3944,1.0,"Very political. If you're not politically connected, you will be shuttled into a dead-end position. Shady and unethical comp practices."

3953,5.0,"- Need to build relationships to have certain work opportunities. If your a ""I like user stories"" kind of person, this will become a problem after 1 year. On the upside you get to pick what assists you work on. I would often pick up the more interesting coding requests like an Eagle. If you hate flows, you don't need to work on flows if your already busy! I'm not sure anyone was aware of my Eagle strategy until I told them. Watch like a hawk and take what you want. - Too much front-end, not enough back-end. But you could say this for Salesforce tech in general. - To HR management: Leveling system should be fixed by +1."
3954,5.0,Work pressure More meetings/ long work calls
3955,5.0,Growth opportunities can be limited.
3956,5.0,Lower pay on average compared to the industry
3957,5.0,1. Work is fast paced. Initially it will take time to get into that mode.
3958,5.0,"- The job itself is not ""easy."" Because the company is always innovating, always bringing new products and solutions to market, and always striving to stay at the forefront of the most pressing business challenges and trends facing our customers, there's constantly new information we need to learn in order to be trusted advisors to the clients we support. It's a lot to learn and stay enabled on; this is a company that thrives on fast-paced change. - Additionally, because our platform literally does everything, there are a variety of ""point solution"" competitors big and small that we have to constantly stay one step ahead of. Fortunately, Salesforce invests in product specialists, competitive intelligence teams, and other resources to support you. - You can definitely make a lot of money here if you are a top performer. That said, I get the sense that our base salaries are less competitive than comparable software sales roles at other high tech companies. That's a tradeoff to working at the best company though. Once you work here, you can get hired wherever. In fact, many people leave the company in order to get a MUCH more senior role somewhere else, and then leverage that to come back to Salesforce at much higher role and salary band. Staying at Salesforce might mean that your upward mobility is slower."
3959,4.0,"A lot of products and sometimes not the right amount of support, lower comp then most other places but make up for it with ESPP and other perks"

3968,5.0,Lower pay than FAANG Hard to get to senior positions
3969,5.0,"There is a lot of pride in Salesforce's culture, which can often feel a bit cult-like. I joined Salesforce through an acquisition, and the leaders at the acquired company seemed much more used to tough questions than leaders that I observed at Salesforce. There's also a lot of internal training stuff through their internal trailhead platform that seems more time-consuming and less value-packed compared to other companies I've worked at."
3970,5.0,It is a huge company with many processes in place.
3971,5.0,"The pace of work. While it's perfectly fine for me, the quick pace and ability to pivot might not be fore everyone."
3972,2.0,"Wages are stagnant, not keeping pace with inflation-in the United States is 6.8% for the 12 months ended November 2021, meaning with the 4-5% raises we are expecting, we enter 2022 behind. Attrition is becoming a serious issue. Getting VERY big and a series of promotions from without and seemingly disingenuous internal promotion systems (you cannot brag about how many new roles are open when a majority of these new roles are already spoken for by the people in the roles you killed off). This make it the best dead end job you'll ever have. Salesforce has reached that place where leadership thinks only outsiders can help make change vs. looking who they work with and their capabilities. After a decade, if I had a good opportunity come up, I'd leave."
3973,5.0,Lower pay than FAANG Hard to get to senior positions
3974,5.0,"Not many cons, but often a lot of work is expected from you, i.e. 50-60 hrs/week."
3975,5.0,The con of Salesforce is the compensation is a bit on the lower end.
3976,5.0,"Often times it's all about Territory, Timing, Talent"

4001,3.0,Sales plan based unsustainable targets plus penalize you when customer doesn’t renew
4002,5.0,Need to be able to be flexible and adaptable and a continuous learner in a high pace environment (con is the speed of change and demands to keep up with it but also it creates the opportunities for personal growth).
4003,5.0,Be more selective when choosing managers! People leave managers!
4004,5.0,"Unclear promotion path, constant change"
4005,4.0,Hard to navigate the politics Hard to move up

4007,5.0,$100/mo wellness actually comes out to be about 60/mo after tax
4008,5.0,"Company is getting bigger quickly, not making short term tradeoffs and continuously bringing in great people to maintain high standards will potentially present challenges."

4010,1.0,Leadership team has opportunity for growth
4011,4.0,"Comming from acquisition, roadmap is unclear"
4012,4.0,"People managers have very limited budget to retain top talent, and equity is far from competitive. Even at annual review period in Feb 2022, very few “raises” even matched inflation for a proper COLA, let alone performance based award incentives. This makes it very difficult to keep the best people around long after their first couple RSU vests, as competing offers elsewhere are much more lucrative."
4013,3.0,"Low Salary, Terrible Management, Lots of folks overworked or sent on projects while underqualified"
4014,4.0,Promotions aren't super transparent - takes longer to move up internally vs if you come externally
4015,1.0,"They think they have a good culture when really it's just a cult. Most people being brought in act like everyone should get a trophy and most frontline manager are feckless, political, little people with a true talent of thinking themselves as mini benioffs. It's really quite disgusting."
4016,2.0,"CSG / Professional Services - miserable, incompetent, toxic."
4017,5.0,Coworkers in different time zone
4018,1.0,"The pay is a joke here. It doesn’t matter how good you are. There is nepotism going on and you can’t get promoted unless you leave the company and come back. I liked it when I started but the pay is too low, it’s not worth it anymore. Management doesn’t care. You can have solid data showing you are more than capable of people in higher levels than you, and they always come back with answers that are all fluff."
4019,5.0,Too flexible at times makes it hardwe to fet ghinfs done around everyone's various stuff
4020,4.0,"Work is super demanding, and bureaucracy started to building out as the company continued to get bigger. Decision making process can be very slow depending on certain department, which could lead to a lot of rework."
4021,4.0,"Salary and pay progression, managers, promotions,"
4022,3.0,"The work life balance has gotten absolutely horrible. The company acts like wellness is important, but the expectation has become to work endless hours and always be available to respond to notifications. The co-CEO structure is very odd and they have a strange dynamic. Also have heard rumors of a hiring freeze."
4023,5.0,Build process can be slow
4024,5.0,"Most individuals are being onboarded remotely, which is not a smooth transition at any company since these are new processes due to the pandemic. While Salesforce is probably ahead of the curve, you will be inundated with LOTS of self-navigation resources during your onboarding experience. It can be a lot to organize and digest."
4025,5.0,Could not think of any cons
4026,5.0,"Not for people who can't create content and communicate product value to an audience. Part of the interview process requires you to put together a presentation for a panel of interviewers. You give a 15-minute elevator pitch. with only an outline provided. You have to go create your presentation based on research, and the marketing materials that are available online. I felt like this gave me an opportunity to showcase my individuality and unique style, but others might feel overwhelmed."
4027,5.0,Not really a con but a watch item is maintaining the great culture while the company continues to grow rapidly.
4028,5.0,So many tools available that onboarding is like drinking from a firehose.
4029,3.0,"Marc is the only decision-maker at Salesforce. He will revert the decisions of tenured & seasoned executives, his ELT, or any C-team member in a second. This devastates the teams and people doing the work. Competency is not a criteria for C-level jobs. Marc's favoritism is. One needs only to look at the exodus of Marketing talent (at all levels) in 2021 to see the impact of his most recent CMO selection. With an army of talented leaders, but very limited opportunity for them to actually make decisions, the battle for ownership of the remaining work is more important than doing the work itself."
4030,5.0,pay is not as competitive
4031,2.0,"Quotas were practically doubled this year (FY23), while territories were ""streamlined."" No amount of C360 kool aid can hide the fact your commissions will be lower this year. Compared to the previous fiscal, you need to work twice as hard, with less business, in order to earn your commissions (not to mention the typical internal battles to keep accounts that have international offices and/or were acquired). If you're a realist, you see very slim chance of hitting your number, unless you are lucky enough to have a handful of hyper growth accounts (in a downturn economy). I guess that's what the company needs to do in order to hit $50B. I expect quite a bit of sales churn in the coming months."
4032,3.0,Continuously changing promotion goals Bad pay compared to industry
4033,5.0,Sometimes too big but big has pros
4034,4.0,Only con is that you have to be serious about the hunt. You are calling executives which in my opinion are harder to sell to than consumers. There are also a lot of certifications you have to take which can be annoying when you want to just pick up the phone and dial.
4035,4.0,"Not great pay A little “cultish” Leadership, team and accounts change frequently"
4036,5.0,Low compensation for my role and low growth opportunities

4045,5.0,No cons working at Salesforce
4046,5.0,Too flexible at times makes it hardwe to fet ghinfs done around everyone's various stuff
4047,4.0,Leadership disregards/ dismisses concerns raised by reps in role Overall not a lot of transparency from leadership Didn't adjust salary according to inflation or give any kind of YOY increase Close to no chance for early promotion Commission is basically nonexistent even when you hit your numbers Long work hours (7:30am-5:30pm) Increasing turn over rate due to poor pay
4048,5.0,Pressure to perform. Potential to get a weak territory due to the market saturation.
4049,5.0,"There are so many things to do! It can be a bit overwhelming if your time management skills are efficient. Your career and development is totally in your control and there is more than enough opportunity to stretch yourself thin if you have difficulty committing and not committing to events. Drinking from the fire hose is the analogy most often used, for good reason."
4050,5.0,Change is constant and you need to work through ambiguity well.
4051,5.0,None from me at the moment
4052,2.0,For people who like to manage their own business Salesforce is not the place. They micromanage to an incredible level and have a very used car sales feel at times.
4053,4.0,Hard to get approval for conference speaking engagement The pace of work can be fast at times The type of work can be checkbox security at times
4054,4.0,"long hours, too much competittion"
4055,5.0,If you are right out of college you are in but if you are older forget it they dont want you!
4056,3.0,Pay is not what it should be. Promotions/raises are too structured.
4057,3.0,Doesn’t care about employees Promotion process is 6+ months of networking Quota doubled and territory shrunk this past year
4058,5.0,Pressure to perform. Potential to get a weak territory due to the market saturation.

4065,5.0,"With positions being remote, if you are hired as a remote employee its hard to connect with coworkers, but SF does a great job closing that gap."
4066,5.0,"There's a corporate koolaide flavor to the rah rah, but that's to be expected. More and more clients are giant enterprise behemoths, so working with them is a often a grind."
4067,5.0,I have nothing bad to say about it
4068,4.0,Takes 50 people to do anything
4069,5.0,Processes sometimes take a long time
4070,5.0,There is none so far!
4071,1.0,"-Fake image of goodness. Genuinely feels like a cult. -Many think they're special because they work here. Don't be a sucker for really good corporate marketing like I was. They're selling you a dream. You don't need a company to feel special. -Lots of red tape and arbitrary, made-up rules -Low pay, shady comp plan -Very likely that you'll work under toxic, incompetent, hypocritical, tyrannical, self-serving leadership. You will be gaslit at this company. -Endless admin tasks -Cringe-worthy jargon -Manuel processes (funny, for a company that's all about improving business efficiency) -Incredibly messy CRM (funny, for a company that invented CRM) -Most reps have no idea what they sell and lean on SEs all day -Nonstop power games -You're just a cog in a machine"

4087,4.0,"Extreme title inflation compared to tech company peers Some big egos - you have to know how to market yourself and your accomplishments to be seen / advance (it is a sales & marketing company after all!). More than once I saw this happen even if actual underlying performance was mediocre or if the person was harsh towards junior team members or peers. Big budgets - teams spent $$ on things that really didn't need to be bought. Use it or lose it culture as it related to budget. Financial margins could be bigger if spend could be better controlled, but the spend culture created a challenge. If the company needed to control spend, hiring and/or T&E were the levers used creating sudden starts and stops in both these areas."

4157,1.0,"I believe that the REWS leadership is very much lacking. We are forced to baby REWS leadership like royalty to ""show off our hospitality skills"" but don't give the same treatment to even our most exclusive customers. I'm talking Starbucks three times a day with multiple drink options, extravagant catering setups with ridiculous dietary restrictions/preferences, gifts in the hundreds and hundreds of dollars for each exec for each visit, flowers and local fare being supplied in their hotel rooms, etc. These folks live like rockstars on the road. When COVID first started, we had front desk personnel crying because they were forced to stay at the desk. This same org was the first forced to come back into the office. Guidelines were set that everyone were to come back, no exceptions. Yet, we were finding out that exceptions were being made in other offices (unfair). The REWS leadership outwardly encourages employees to look for jobs outside of the org because, although they won't say it, there is no opportunity within it. When promotions or openings upward come available, they are given to those outside the company. The REWS team is the lowest paid org in the company and is treated like a cog in the machine. Very few people feel empowered to advocate for themselves or their teams. I can't remember the last time my team had a team-building, let alone a team-wide meeting. Managers only care about making sure they are seen in a good light for execs."

If you land in a bad territory there's nothing you can do - all territories are set for 12 months. I'm on a team of 5-9 AEs and we have one SDR for support. At a world class sales org, you'd think you'd have more support to generate meetings and interest. Lots of cooks in the kitchen on every deal.

I only met a few people who actually knew what the Salesforce platform was, how it was used for different verticals and what the benefits were for customers. Trying to to use the product internally was a comedy of errors. No one understands how it works or how to use it. Too many siloes, even the siloes have siloes. 1200 tiles on okta, are you kidding? Lots of politics and backstabbing. Many problems caused or perpetuated by the very people who say they are trying to fix it. Leadership was more cliquey than high school. From what I saw the opportunity for advancement comes down to who your manager is, but sadly there are a lot of managers who are not qualified at all and are simply afraid of talent."

4188,3.0,"The not-so-great: Salesforce is focused on growth and that means squeezing every penny out of its customers. To do this, they put a lot of sales reps into small territories. Sales reps are tasked with selling with big quotas and small territories. On the aggregate, Salesforce does well but individually it is becoming more and more difficult to hit quota. Less than 30% of Account Executives (AEs) actually hit their number if that tells you anything. Further, the resources around AEs internally are becoming more of an obstacle than a benefit. The hardest part of this job is getting others internally to do their jobs. If you raise your concerns, someone will hear you and then nothing will get done. You will just be making excuses. There are a lot of great sales professionals at Salesforce. However, with smaller territories, the good AEs are leaving. The newbies who are still learning are the ones trying to sell to customers. Customers complain about the constant churn of account teams. One of the top complaints is employee burnout and nothing seems to be done about it."
4189,5.0,- Felt like we missed out on some product training during the onboarding BUT Salesforce offers such a wide variety of products for us to help solve our clients needs if we did deep dive training on each it would be years before we got in front of clients and learning in the real world

Because this is such a great company, many people are willing to go the extra mile to keep this good thing going. There may be some mild challenges in terms of managing the culture internally, and ensuring that every group feels included, and part of the Salesforce family.

Things are never expected in a timely manner. -Goals are a joke. Majority of reps never get close to them so your actual take home pay will be much less than you anticipate regarding commission -You'll want to scream it's so frustrating. You'll feel very alone.

4250,5.0,"The company moves very quickly, and if you don't put boundaries around your calendar, it will consume you.

4286,3.0,"Underneath its grandiose, towering presence and pristine public reputation, lies a dark reality in the sales organization. I could never recommend a career in sales at Salesforce for these reasons: Compensation: Salesforce's base and OTE's are well under the market rate for Account Executives. On top of that, you are punished financially for being promoted within the company, and will receive a base/OTE that is 10-20k lower than external hires. Due to this, there is incredibly high turnover, as long term Salesforce sales employees bounce to other companies to receive proper compensation and many of the sales teams are constantly dominated by new hires. Territories are created in a way in which only about 20% of reps will hit their annual number so base your expected income on your base rate and how comfortable you would be living off of that number. Customer treatment: Salesforce redistributes territories every fiscal year, meaning customers are given a new Account Executive every year. This leads to extreme frustration and oftentimes, customers being sold solutions that they don't necessarily need. Expect to be dealing with many angry customers during the first part of the fiscal year, and cleaning up the mess created by the previous AE. Management: From my experience, I have had some of the most micromanaging and condescending bosses of my career at Salesforce. Even though I am a remote employee, I constantly feel as if my boss is looking over my shoulder through the constant Slack messages and tracking of my daily activity (call/email volume). The worst part is the culture of toxic positivity. Never admit that you are struggling either with work or in your personal life, as that will be used against you in one way or another. Favoritism is rampant and is gifted to those who go out of their way to express immense gratitude, compliment their boss, and NEVER admit frustrations, even if valid. Sorry, but I'm too old to act like a corporate robot monkey. Career mobility: As I mentioned above, in the sales organization, your pay will hardly change as you go up-market. Switching into other departments is nearly impossible as you must seek VP level approvals, navigate the lousy internal recruiting teams, and build up a case as to why you are more valuable than external hires. This is why there are so many Salesforce boomerangs... Ultimately, I had really high hopes for the Sales Organization at Salesforce, but was super disappointed by my experience. I understand that not every experience will be the same, but I think it is important to look past the facade."

Several coworkers described experiences of being horribly berated by hatchet folks in HR based on ""complaints"" that HR would not clarify or explain. They described being pulled onto phone calls and told they have to ""apologize for what you did"", and when asked what they were talking about, would be told ""it's impossible that you don't know what we're talking about and if you don't then it's even worse than we thought."" Some have hypothesized this is how Salesforce rattles employees they, for whatever reason, decide they want to leave ( inside scoop indicates this is another maneuver by some VPs to create ""opportunities"" to shape an org the way they want when they get key folks to self-select out) but have no reason to push them out or worse yet, the employees were actually considered high performing by prior managers. I highly recommend anyone considering Salesforce to stay away unless it is the best you can get because its a huge company, if you get on the wrong side of just about anyone it could get really bad for you and there is nothing you can do."

4380,2.0,"I don't know what the culture is like on other teams, but my team is not diverse at all. I'm the only black person on my team, and even on our larger 30 person team, there are only 3 people of Asian descent (which is nuts considering tech demographics overall), everyone else is white or white-passing, and I don't see that changing anytime soon. There has been a lot of marketing recently about Salesforce meeting its 50% underrepresented goal a year early, but that number includes all women, and if it didn't they'd never meet their goal. A lot of middle managers are not interested in diversity and definitely not inclusion. Even if you're hired here as a black employee, you won't be treated equally and people will question your experience and abilities constantly. It's demoralizing, and it explains why retention is so low. I wouldn't recommend working here unless you have a bigger goal in mind for what you want to do next."
4381,1.0,"Make no money, each year they make it harder to make money. No multi-year payout. To many things to list. Just dont work here, you'll learn some, but will hate your life after about 3 months"

You give a 15-minute elevator pitch. with only an outline provided. You have to go create your presentation based on research, and the marketing materials that are available online.

4520,4.0,"- The better you are at networking and being outgoing, the farther you can go. - It is an intensely sales-focused culture, and that can be frustrating if you want to contribute but don't aspire to be a salesperson. - Working with senior executives is hit or miss. Some are amazingly supportive. - - Others are bogged down and distracted due to top-down pressure from the President's Committee. - The closer your orbit is to the company's top executives the, more stressful you life is likely to be."

Was told several times during my time ""stop trying to develop relationships, you won't be covering that account next year"" and ""it's not your problem if the implementation fails, just sell the licenses and someone will worry about it later."" Was shocked by the level of micromanagement, time wasted on internal meetings, and sense of self-importance. Also, reps (often with manager support) spend a remarkable amount of time ""gaming"" the internal system. Setting up dupe accounts to manipulate commissions, a practice that often creates internal confusion which ultimately impacts the customer experience."
4534,2.0,- Worked for Revenue cloud. Too much politics and favoritism. Systemic discrimination against women. The VP would give promotions and rewards only to his favorites from past companies.

4540,3.0,"Marc is the only decision-maker at Salesforce. He will revert the decisions of tenured & seasoned executives, his ELT, or any C-team member in a second. This devastates the teams and people doing the work. Competency is not a criteria for C-level jobs. Marc's favoritism is. One needs only to look at the exodus of Marketing talent (at all levels) in 2021 to see the impact of his most recent CMO selection. With an army of talented leaders, but very limited opportunity for them to actually make decisions, the battle for ownership of the remaining work is more important than doing the work itself."
4541,5.0,The company is growing rapidly and sometimes you're unsure how you fit into the larger picture.
4542,5.0,With rapid growth comes challenges such as finding information and resources. Growth also means that things can be disorganized at times. I have heard some departments complain of workloads.

4565,5.0,Hard to keep up with the growth in product portfolio
4566,5.0,A very complicated bureaucracy which occasionally results in people working together who have somewhat competing agendas.
4567,5.0,Nothing bad to say about Salesforce after working there for almost 3 years!
4568,3.0,"Salesforce is better at buying outside talent than it is at developing its own people which is why there are so many boomerang employees. People leave to get the experience they need to go to the next role they want. There are no formal performance reviews meaning being promoted to your next role is very subjective depending on whether or not your leadership team likes you. Additionally, for the all the talk about showing up to work and embracing your authentic self, at the end of the day all anyone cares about is how you show up on a dashboard which incentives people to log things they did not do sometimes to an absurd degree like someone logging that they worked 70 hours a week every week for a quarter and then getting an award for most hours logged. Relatedly there is a huge emphasis placed on managing your personal brand. If you come from a cultural background where you are taught to do your best work day after day and expect that to be noticed in merit of itself, you will be disappointed working here at least in the sales organization. You have to have the desire to talk about yourself a lot and be a self promoter. Lastly, I want to share something I personally observed while working here. In my first sales team which was predominantly white, we had one female person of color on the team. She was exceptionally hard working, eager to learn, and dedicated to her job. Management and her colleagues did not support her in the way that was needed for her to reach her full potential. Moreover I believe they made work difficult for her in an effort to push her out of the organization. I never understood why. Maybe she didn't fit a type that her team was looking for. She later left to join another company where she is, unsurprising to me, doing very well. I would have thought that retaining and supporting talented employees of all backgrounds would be a priority but especially employees of color given how much Salesforce as a company talks about diversifying its workforce."
4569,5.0,Nothing that I can think of at this time

4584,4.0,"Tons of ""top down"" information drives and initiatives, very regular training assignments related to overall company mission and strategy"
4585,4.0,"Can be very stressful at month/quarter/year ends. Deadlines can be incredibly hard to meet - even when working with teams of some highly motivated and intelligent people. Generally speaking, people are very passionate which is great, but can lead to conflict if there are competing interests. This can be uncomfortable, but is something you have to get used to. Upper management is 50/50 on saying the right thing vs saying something completely tone deaf (though admittedly, this ratio is still much better than most places). Work life balance is often talked about and encouraged, but when push comes to shove, the work has to get done, and sometimes you’re left holding the short end of that stick."
4586,3.0,Clicky politics did not develop talent Sabotage behavior
4587,5.0,Salesforce is growing at an enormous pace and sometimes the quick growth brings a lot more red tape in conducting business.

4591,3.0,"I came into Salesforce like every rep, excited and eager to get my “MBA” in sales. Working here you’ll have to be prepared to give up everything just to stay afloat. In the first year you will most likely be given a terrible territory and what you do with it will decide your future here. Things you will need to juggle effortlessly or will lead you down the road of being let go are: - Activity- lots of calls. People who fib numbers here are celebrated by leadership but frowned upon by reps - Opp rigor- the amount of fields you will need to update are mind numbing - Pipeline- with a terrible territory be prepared to pipe aspirational pipeline that will be highly scrutinized - Prep meetings- there are endless prep meetings before calls. Due to schedules each person involved will require a prep meeting, leaving your day with little time for anything else. - Team selling- be prepared to sell with folks much junior than you and not held to as high of standards. If the deal falls through, it’s on you. There are a few coprimes that are skilled sales reps - Your “brand”- It’s important to maintain appearances, even on bad days. Your brand is determined by how involved you are in diversity, volunteer work, and leading the team, which requires tenure. -Manager 1:1’s- these are a trap to look out for. Salesforce preaches trust as one of it pillars, but beware that everything said in those meetings will be used against you when they have soured on you - Time management- working a 12 hr day is table stakes. There are endless distractions you will need to navigate and make hard decisions on “brand”/ appearance maintenance vs selling The work/life balance is very heavy on the work side. The exec team repeatedly say their biggest regrets are not spending enough time with family. This will never change if they don’t take it serious. There is a lot you can learn here but at the expense of your self confidence as some managers make you feel worthless when your awful territory isn’t performing. If that isn’t enough to make you steer clear, the pay is very low and less than 20% of reps hit their annual numbers The “Ohana” culture is a mirage. There is nothing remotely familial about the culture. It is an ultra competitive pressure cooker. I just had such higher hopes for my experience left disappointed..."

It's made acquisitions the past few years and it takes time to understand those companies/products and how to incorporate them into how translate business value for customers.

4598,5.0,I don’t have much to complain.

4627,2.0,"As someone whose been with the company many years, it has transitioned from a smaller, agile, product-focused company to a Marketing and Sales holding company that does little or no product development. Nearly every major product announcement over the last few years featured huge fanfare, but resulted in the product dying a quiet end within 2 years. Pretty much every major product announcement now is just a Marketing 're-alignment', rebranding existing products, not actually developing anything new. All innovation is bought, not developed internally, and there is little sign that the various acquisitions (Mule, Tableau, Slack) are actually creating a 2+2=5 effect. It really feels like a bunch of independent companies that are owned by the same conglomerate. The focus on growth by acquisition also means very limited growth opportunities internally since the existing products aren't really growing or innovating significantly, it isn't creating new positions. A new, related phenomenon is that in order to retain talent, many low-to-middle managers are getting 'promotions in place', i.e. they are getting a bigger title and more money without additional responsibility because their orgs aren't growing. So you see lots of VPs with only two directs who are also VPs, creating lots of unnecessary layers of management who all feel they have to micromanage those below them in order to show they are 'adding value'. This lack of organic growth means a lot of people are attritting because they don't see any real career path. Career development isn't a focus beyond the first line of management. After that its all operations, process and programs. Manager success is evaluated on how many programs did you develop and market, not how many employees did you develop or how productive and happy is your team. Another issue is the split between the company image and Sales. While I do think a lot of product and engineering people do really believe in the company values, remember, this is a company founded by a Sales Guy. There is a very cutthroat sales mentality inherited from Oracle that often sees sales reps and leaders blatantly ignore values like trust, equality and customer success in order to hit their quarterly number. Sales is really the #1 value. The large and not rationalized product stack means that often sales reps are pitted against each other because they have overlapping products, and the result can be the customer gets the product of the better rep, not the product they need. Many products are 'zombie' products with no future product development and virtually no support staff, but because there are reps with quota on them, they are still being sold despite the fact that the customer will likely attrit in a couple of years once they realize they've been sold a lemon. Turnover in the Sales org also means a lot of inexperienced account execs who have zero understanding of the products or the company culture but are still being put on big accounts. Over and over you'll hear how solutions teams are the most vital part of the sales organization, but every award, spiff or shoutout goes to the sales rep. You'll hear about some amazing demo that sold the deal but the only names you will here are 5 different reps/AEs, like they did all the work themselves. They'll pat themselves on the back, go off to sales club and collect a massive commission and the SE will get back to work. Another thing most new employees won't notice at first because they just got their nice offer package, is that Salesforce hires at much higher dollar amount than it pays existing employees. Pretty much every new hire will make a LOT more than everyone else on a team. It's joked repeatedly that if you want a raise or promotion, your best option is to leave the company and get re-hired in a year. Stock is incredibly stingy. Unlike most tech companies that do yearly refreshes, you will be lucky to get new RSUs every 3-4 years, even for very top performers. Many relatively senior employees (15+ years overall experience, 4+ with company) have NO stock. A team of 10 might get 2-3 stock refreshes in a year. This is the #1 retention tool, and yet Salesforce consistently lags behind all competitors here. A lot of lip-service is given to the 'giving back' part of the company. When I joined this was for real. You got a week of VTO time, and if you used all that you'd get a sizeable grant to give to a charity of your choice. They removed the grants a few years ago without making any real announcement. The VTO time is still there but if you are above a certain level, you are on 'unlimited' PTO (which means you can take what you want, but only if your manager is cool AND you don't feel guilty about taking off during whatever crisis is currently happening). This makes the VTO time meaningless, since it just gets blurred in with PTO and sick leave."

4630,2.0,"-Terrible onboarding and training for external hires. Literally expects you to just jump in and start closing. -Micromanaging environment. All they care about is numbers and deals closed. -Tons of politics involved to get promoted. All about who likes you and if you're sipping the company kool-aid mindlessly. -Low pay. Company is not competitive and relies on brand recognition to lure talent. -Territory cut in half and quota increased. Very few reps hit monthly number. -Sales processes and tools are limited and outdated. -Lack of diversity. Seems to be focused on women only with little energy on supporting/hiring more people of color within Sales org. In all Salesforce is a mature, ""stable"" company and isn't for those looking for an innovative, hip, diverse, and product driven environment. Also if you're looking for lucrative pay this definitely isn't the place. Beware."

4668,3.0,"The not-so-great: Salesforce is focused on growth and that means squeezing every penny out of its customers. To do this, they put a lot of sales reps into small territories. Sales reps are tasked with selling with big quotas and small territories. On the aggregate, Salesforce does well but individually it is becoming more and more difficult to hit quota. Less than 30% of Account Executives (AEs) actually hit their number if that tells you anything. Further, the resources around AEs internally are becoming more of an obstacle than a benefit. The hardest part of this job is getting others internally to do their jobs. If you raise your concerns, someone will hear you and then nothing will get done. You will just be making excuses. There are a lot of great sales professionals at Salesforce. However, with smaller territories, the good AEs are leaving. The newbies who are still learning are the ones trying to sell to customers. Customers complain about the constant churn of account teams. One of the top complaints is employee burnout and nothing seems to be done about it."

4672,1.0,"-Not up front about role and territory before hiring (may give you a terrible role and you won't find out until it's too late.

Be ready to work with tons of people who think they are God's gift to the world. They'll be super fake but not help. -Be ready to learn everything on their internal Google that is terrible. Need help? Log a ticket. Got a question? Log a ticket. Have an issue? Log a ticket. Ticket didn't help? Log another ticket. -Training takes weeks and will be unrelated to your actual job -Internal support resource teams will say no most of the time and RVPs don't have the ability to do anything about it -If an internal team does help, be ready for them to take months to actually do what is asked. Things are never expected in a timely manner. -Goals are a joke. Majority of reps never get close to them so your actual take home pay will be much less than you anticipate regarding commission -You'll want to scream it's so frustrating. You'll feel very alone. Be careful before deciding to work for this company. The media shares how wonderful it is but realistically they do not care about you at all and treat you like a robot."

A little more focus on a combination of the two and finding the right balance between numerical metrics and knowledgable skills & know-how needs to be recognised/implemented. - Exposure really only to sales vs. other business units.

4822,4.0,"Sales driven, political, entrepreneurship, creative, focus"
4823,4.0,"Unfortunately the on-boarding process, in my experience has been terrible. It is very much a sink or swim and sadly I had very little guidance on getting upto speed in my first 6 months which I feel has hindered my development. There is an opportunity to enable and engage new employees in a much better way. I didn't get to shoadow anyone for a week or two and 90% of things I have had to figure out on my own."

4831,5.0,Not proper communication through management
4832,4.0,"Due to the fast-growing nature of the company, work-life balance takes a hit."
4833,5.0,"- Sometimes unrealistic sales / business management expectations from product resulting in oversells, it's a solid product but there's a lot of work needed to get to a setup that will do well on the enterprise scale. Smaller setups can work but if you are looking for the big benefits it requires time investment. - The 'family feel' push internally. This is really nice when you are newly immersed in it but you also need to be wary of assuming it's like a perfect family. Families have fights, internal squabbles and sometimes break apart so always look after your own future don't expect that completely from the company. - Steep learning curve if you've never worked on Salesforce product(s) before but there is lots of help there. Still a great place to work and earn professional experience or build your career. Genuinely love the company and everything they've done for me to date."
4834,1.0,"It's not for Salesforce as a company but for some specific teams like Heroku where politics is at, it's best. People who work will get nothing and those who don't will get promotions. Even if you do your best you will not be appreciated and some who are close to the manager will be appreciated for no reason. Had a good experience till 2persons joined the team and spoiled it fully. Never supported by manager to grow in career."
4835,5.0,"Change happens constantly, and sometimes it's uncomfortable, or jarring, even. You're not suited for Salesforce if you're looking for a cushy role where you can just 'settle in' and relax. The company is always evolving, and you have to be adaptable to go along with it. A large company also means that increasingly, more operational processes have been installed. Is it a pain? Yes, sometimes. But is it bearable in the grand scheme of things? Also yes."
4836,3.0,There is no work life balance at this company

4838,4.0,Shifts Nothing much Carrer growth Unrealistic targets No regular working hours
4839,1.0,No yearly performance reviews. No yearly salary increase. Change management every year. Toxic environment. Self-centred people. Back-stabbing culture. People higher up take credit for work others have done. Everyone is there for the money and pretend to make the world a better place. If management doesn't like you they'll make sure you won't progress in your career.

4852,4.0,Not enough time in a day.
4853,5.0,"- As an SE, we’re often times spread very thin. In addition to pre-sales, we provide booth duty (marketing) and enablement (post sales) support. This leaves us no time to get the real work done, so we use nights and weekends to build and solution. - Marketing is usually 6 months - 1 year ahead of the products themselves. - Our customers love Salesforce but I spend most of my time education customers because they are confused on the products we offer. Putting Einstein and Lightning in front of every product confuses the crap out of everyone including internal employees - 3 weeks vacation for non exempt employees could be better - I often find that in order to use my VTO, I’m working overtime, because my work still needs to get done even if I’m doing volunteer work - Way too many all hands meetings. - Administrative overhead in general is extremely time consuming: time and expense reporting, activities entry, DCs, and administrative quip docs. - Turnover with our AE counterparts can impede on our ability to sell"
4854,5.0,"Boring and Corporate. People were nice, but that's about it."
4855,4.0,Lack of direction in Infrastructure
4856,3.0,"The problem is that they continue to acquire companies, and within those companies individuals who are less than qualified or do not fit the Salesforce culture also get acquired. If you happen to become apart of one of these products and teams, it's extremely difficult to get out of and Salesforce takes years to fire individuals that desperately need to be removed from the company. Management says that their hands are tied with Employee Success and Employee Success drags their feet, causing teams and clients to suffer dramatically. The Marketing cloud is notorious for this behavior and has an internal reputation from Salesforce Core to not hire individuals that come from the Marketing Cloud due to the individuals that do not represent the company and the Marketing Cloud well."
4857,5.0,"It can be challenging to make a vertical or horizontal move out of a sales role without spending at least 2 years in sales, which is frustrating,."

4859,4.0,"People end up getting stuck there, career growth in limited, very siloed teams."
4860,4.0,"As a developer, the career ladder is rather unattractive. It doesn't really feel like there's much that distinguishes people with the various titles, and in many cases it seems titles just reflect time with the company as oppose to meeting the ""requirements"" outlined in the descriptions of said titles. That said, there's not much emphasis placed on titles and I've never noticed any lack of respect between those in different places in the career ladder."
4861,3.0,"Constant growth cuts in to resourcing to do the work already present, i.e. company wide travel bans. Some business functions are awash in money and people; others are thread-bare, with no discernable difference in impact or “importance to making money” Pay is below industry peers"
4862,2.0,"Boiler room mentality, customer success is more of marketing-Customers are harassed constantly to keep up with monthly close and cadence.No long term strategy in enterprise accounts and customers are getting fatigued by this behaviour-Micro managment who only care about monthly ACV in Strategic accounts -High turnover in upper end of strategic sales.-Terrible mid level management who manage based on fear over mid 40s experienced sales team for Carolinas and Atlanta-No work life balance"
4863,1.0,"The politics in play prevent you from doing your job. You are not recognized for performance, and there are limited opportunities for growth. Salesforce overworks and underpays employees in key roles while rewarding employees in roles that are less critical. You are subjected to trial by fire with little or no management support."
4864,4.0,Too many changes too often.
4865,5.0,Chicago is a new office for Salesforce.com. The company is trying hard to maintain a small company feel and culture but it is a challenge with over 8500 employees.
4866,2.0,"SFDC is struggling to figure out how to be a big company. Has hard-nosed, win at all costs Oracle-type culture. You need to decide if you're into that. Sales mgmt has no problem berating entire teams in conference calls. Mgmt within the Platform team is unfocused and not very seasoned. Company turns a blind eye to hyper aggressive field sales people who run over their fellow employees."
4867,2.0,"Terrible culture, finance team had long exhausting hours, the work was not rewarding, people not rewarded, long timers earning tons but new comers do not feel valued after a short period of time, no mentoring etc. There is a lot of talk about work-life balance but finance did not live up to the ""chatter"""
4868,5.0,"This is not a company you can coast at. It is filled with A players, so if you're looking for an easy ride, this isn't it."
4869,5.0,"I think it is common with large companies to have a lot going on (info overload, lots of moving pieces) and it can be a bit overwhelming at times. Not a deal breaker by any means just on par with what I'd expect similar companies to experience."
4870,5.0,"Be more competitive with perks, e.g. free meals or more shuttles Non-HQ offices receive less love Some promotions seem to be a popularity contest"
4871,4.0,"benefits are expensive, have to pay for parking."
4872,4.0,It's a big organization so can be hard to get recognized.
4873,3.0,The culture can be a bit overwhelming. The place is under constant change and sometimes feels like there is no rhyme or reason and ignorance of the obvious; Although the company is 19 years old there still lacks a lot of process and procedure. It often feels like our CEO and some of our senior leadership they are more interested in politics than what is best for our company.
4874,5.0,The possibility of job burnout is high with long hours and high stress. There is a lot of writing for MBR and QBR documents. Difficulty in getting to the next level
4875,1.0,"Ruthless and unethical. You will get kicked to the curb faster than you can blink, regardless of how precarious your life circumstances may be. Absolutely untrustworthy."
4876,5.0,Wouldn't be a con but very fast paced so must be something you are comfortable with
4877,5.0,It’s a big company.
4878,5.0,"no lunch, snack is not good"
4879,4.0,- Insane amount of work - Too many conferences
4880,5.0,Commute to san Francisco is bit pain. Any office in South bay could help people. Salesforce could also provide more stocks like apple google
4881,1.0,"The HR, IT, and other functions that are not core to the sales or development departments are poorly run and managed for those working in satellite locations. We are told the push is to hire internally and we should be given stretch opportunities. However, when you apply for these positions they go with outside candidates and say you need more time with Salesforce to understand the Salesforce culture or other made up requirements, which were not included in the job description. If you are in a non-core position and you do are not in San Francisco or Indianapolis you need to work 3 times as hard and 2 times as long to move anywhere in the company."
4882,4.0,Company's fast growth and expectations from employees to meet the goals may stifle innovation and culture at times
4883,2.0,Sales execs really do not care about customer sat. Sales execs are competitor focused vs customer focused. Salesforce used to buy selective technologies to integrate in our core product... now Salesforce just buys companies to drive our stock up.
4884,5.0,- Lack of conference rooms - Some employees are rude and selfish (this happens everywhere)
4885,4.0,Focus is on internal politics vs sales. Promotions are not merit based and more time is spent selling internally vs to customers. Cloud sales role does not have a clear value to the organization or customers creating constant ambiguity and difficulties in achieving quota.
4886,5.0,Can't think of any cons
4887,5.0,Not an easy job takes a lot of hard work and dedication to be successful

4892,5.0,"As they grow and expand the tribal knowledge can be challenging. Gmail and suite is TERRIBLE! Hours are wasted in finding, sorting etc., email. Calendar and conferencing tools need improvement"
4893,5.0,The size of the company has changed the culture and while we are all one ohana there is greater distance and separation between divisions within the company.
4894,5.0,"No lunch provided? maybe that's the only thing i could think of, but we are helping the community. :)"
4895,5.0,not really an cons I found
4896,3.0,"Like any company, if your manager isn't good you leave. They don't hire managers and onboard them effectively."
4897,3.0,"Mediocre pay, politics, easy to get lost in the shuffle"
4898,5.0,Like any sales org with lots of horses in the race... you sometimes spend more time fighting internally than selling.
4899,2.0,"Where do I begin.... *pay is a joke compared to other large SaaS and tech companies. Even if you hit quota, which by the way barely happens. Please, please, please, don’t believe the hype. Less than 20 % of the people hit quota. I think in GRB it’s less than 10% for 2017. Regardless it’s a joke. I’ve worked at other tech companies and I’ve never seem anything so pathetic. *terrible middle management, I mean terrible. Keep in mind this review is coming from someone who was cosidered realtively succssful, and still think this place is a joke. Anyways, I digress.... Middle management for the most part is made up of people who lack leadership skills, talent, experience. It’s actually joke. It’s like a weird cesspool of account executives being promoted to management. One day theyre your peer, the next day, they’re your superior. Not saying they’re racist or anything, but holy hell, talk about 95% Caucasians Being promoted into these roles. Overall, management (based on my experience, observations, talking to peers,etc) literally brings NO value. They just sit at their computer and run reports, show up late to customer meetings, sit awkwardly/quietly in a conference room during a customer call, but during 1on1s (these are also frequent, redundant, waste of time), they offer to sit in on calls/meetings as if They are providing value. If you’re one of the unfortunate suckers/victims to work for Salesforce please please please understand, your entire success, compensation, will be 99% based on the territory handed to you. That’s it point blank. All the other BS, is Just that BS. Run a few reports and you’ll see the top performs get most of their ACV from organic aka gimmes or flips aka warm leads handed to them by the inside biz dev team. Team. Yes, working hard and doing everything the right way (by the book) will give you a very slight edge, but if you’re not handed a fruitful territory you WILL NOT hit quota or make money. Pleeeeasse, please take this as the truth. Again, I was a top 10-20% person, and I’m leaving this review. I could go on and on, but I’ll end it with this. If you’re an experienced sales professional, do NOT work here. You will regret it and regret it fast. If you’re a developer/coder then Salesforce might be a legit landing spot, otherwise look elsewhere."

4915,3.0,"The technology stack used for development is old in many of the projects most of the work is about maintaining an patching legacy monolithic apps.

Make sure that you understand the policies when you enter this company (schedules, flexibility, wfh, if you are on work visa and want to start a PERM process make sure your type of visa is compatible with their policies for that concern), also make sure that you have good communication with your manager as different managers seem to understand the company's philosophy, values and policies in a different way."

It is a large company and different areas do things differently. - A ton of middle management and time spent in meetings. - While it is great to be a part of a global company, there are challenges involved in working at a remote location (i.e. not in San Francisco). We are often not a priority when SF is involved, so factoring in the time difference, you can be waiting day(s) to get issues resolved. - As with many companies of this size, a lot of ""hurry up and wait."" Get your work done according to a deadline, but watch it sit due to bureaucracy or changing priorities. - Salesforce isn't immune to a lot of the issues that plague software engineers everywhere. Requirements changing after work has already started, stakeholders not appreciating the complexities of the work, etc."

4940,2.0,Below average people Bad executive management Terrible MS culture in infra
4941,3.0,"- A very unsafe culture. Predatory behavior in meetings. Only a white can do such a thing and not face any consequences because trust is a right for the whites and for colored it is a loosely hanging privilege which might be lost anytime and needs to constantly work on earning the privilege. I saw people even at Sr.Director level (who was colored) just leaving the meeting not knowing what to say or do. Eventually that Sr.Director (who was top notch) left the team in the name of personal reasons. Believe it or not, those whites even got promotions and MVP awards. - Nepotism is prevalent. I was fully surprised by the way an engineering lead was lifted up to a top level leadership level so quickly (< 3 months since joining) without producing any good results. He was referred by another well positioned person in the team. The guy lacked humanity and was untrustworthy. He was aggressive, inconsistent, unresponsive, over-confident and was stepping on others toes a lot. Even providing feedback in the feedback app with facts to stop doing such things didn't help. - Absolutely no transparency in promotions. People who did great things didn't get promoted and they left. I was a founding engineer who worked for closely 2 years. Many of the peer reviews were extremely positive. I was involved in some of the top level architecture meetings, was openly stated in those meetings that this is a really critical piece so i was needed to do it and ultimately got the job done from me, only to let a white take over the project once it was done and I saw others getting promoted who built on top of the work I had done. My manager didn't say any bad things in our 1:1s, he promoted others, resigned and just before leaving he talked to me for a minute over a phone call and we never met. I was the biggest fool to trust these people. - I was low balled on the pay and the recruiter lied to me that salesforce doesn't do any sign on bonus and negotiations. - Extremely operations heavy culture. Once a product is built and released to the customers, the pace at which things move is unbelievably slow. Leadership kills innovations, condescends on engineers who innovated and worked hard to build the product and makes everything operations centric."
4942,3.0,"Office politics here are killer. If you're great at backstabbing your colleagues this is the company for you. Little attention paid to strong performers. Instead, it's all about who can brown-nose the most. If you're good at this type of thing, salesforce will be great for you. However, if you're looking to be awarded for your achievements rather than your networking skills, look elsewhere."
4943,5.0,-Company is starting to get so big that the entrepreneurial atmosphere it had is disappearing -Promotion rates are becoming slower
4944,2.0,Salesforce came in and completely change the dynamics of the sales team. Quotas are unrealistic and those who are actually achieving their numbers have 4x the territory than those who aren't. Management plays favorites. It went from a positive environment to an extremely negative one where one isn't motivated to perform well. It feels like Salesforce is trying to manage people out and I don't expect the Pardot sales team to be around in a few years.
4945,4.0,"Pressure. There is a constant, unrelenting pressure to hit your numbers. Normally in sales one faces a 3 EOQ's and one EOY push. At salesforce, you face 11 EOQ's and one EOY push. Basically, every month is like a quarter end. Territories are not intentionally unbalanced, but it does happen. A lot of the success you may or may not experience will be a result of a great or poor territory. Some managers understand this and work with you to maximize your results until the next year when things can be re-balanced, others are quick to terminate. As a result of this territory lottery, success and failure can come quickly. I've seen folks promoted on a single deal in which they made over 70% of their annual number but otherwise similar results."
4946,5.0,Selling the organization to Salesforce made sense but changed the opportunities within the organization.
4947,5.0,Not many come to mind. Sometimes a little too much red tape to get a decision made.
4948,4.0,"Large company bureaucracy (red tape), difficult to work your way up in the company (in large part due to large size & red tape). Work can be monotonous at times (somewhat turns you into a one-trick pony), but, all-in-all, is typically fulfilling on a day-to-day basis."
4949,5.0,"Hard, challenging work (if you don't want to be challenged this could be considered a Con)"
4950,5.0,Global company with two strong an HQ (San Francisco) center of gravity.
4951,2.0,"I joined a smaller company Salesforce owned that was eventually swallowed whole by the larger Salesforce company, and we were fully integrated into one of the major clouds. Things were very pleasant and work was interesting before the roll over into Salesforce. However, once my team joined the larger company, is when things took a turn unfortunately. I believe things took a turn because Salesforce is built on top down management. The bigger the title the bigger the voice you’ll have. People use their title as weight when making decisions. The overall design culture is perceived as a second thought to a lot of teams. Due in part that your engineers can and will make decisions for you based on seniority. Not all, but most teams have a hard time getting their engineers to innovate and work with them. This behavior also comes from the previously mentioned work life balance. Anything that looks like it may take an extra hour, will fall off your design quickly. Be carful of Kool-aid drinking. They use the term “Ohana”, family in Hawaiian culture (which is also cultural appropriation) to describe their own internal company culture. The management team uses this type of thinking to determine if your a team player or not. The type of “family” culture they perpetuate creates a lot of passive aggressive behavior. Add the behavioral issues onto the top down management, and you have a recipe for ladder climbing, favoritism, yes men, and brown nosing. The executive running the design on my cloud showed incredible bias and fueled this behavior. As well as some very questionable hiring and promotional practices. I felt their behavior was highly unethical, and they felt no remorse for their actions. The product you build at Salesforce will only ship 3 times a year. That’s if it ships at all. The pace is incredibly slow moving. I can not stress that enough. Changing an icon can literally take 9 months. This can make it hard to retain the talent that comes from a start up environment. Which Salesforce is in desperate need of. The salary is adequate at best for most designers. I found out later that I actually made much more coming from a different company and rolling into Salesforce. RSU’s are some of the lowest you’ll be awarded in the tech industry for a company this size. Most director level people get any meaningful stock refresher. Like I mentioned, top down management. I negotiated cash over RSU’s (which made my offer compelling). While a lot of what I wrote can seems very negative, not everyone I had the chance to work with made me feel this way. I did have the opportunity to meet “some” talented designers and engineers. I had the opportunity to volunteer and help others. The work I was doing at the time had impact up to certain point and I did learn a thing or two while at Salesforce. TL;DR: Top down management creates passive aggressive behavior. Slow moving development time, Salesforce only ships 3 times a year. Design is a second thought for most teams (but not all). Base salary is average, not competitive. RSU’s for a company this size are some of the worst in the industry."

4960,2.0,"They title people as Field Account Executive however they do not truly operate this way. The culture is 100% IN OFFICE (nothing wrong with this but just be honest when bringing new folks on board). Very little work life balance as my team was unofficially ""required"" in office for 55+ hours every single week. It's a great place to work if you want to simply live just for SFDC, and feel like you're a hamster running in a wheel 24/7/365."

4969,2.0,"This is from our experience..yes OUR because multiple people have expressed identical concerns. General managerial inconsistency and poor and undefined career development Subjective management with unclear expectations and lack of constructive feedback Lack of knowledge and account/opportunity strategy from superiors Unavailability as a resource – poor coaching and lack of involvement with accounts / opportunities Complete lack of trust and transparency with direct line management Inability to coach, mentor and guide effectively – no structure for 1:1 meetings and lack of agenda - Continuous belittlement and criticism despite efforts to improve – general disengagement, lack of proactive coaching resulting in negative retrospective feedback Lack of fair judgment and unprofessional communication in open forums- topics to be discussed in 1:1 posted openly with a belittling nature Unfair and unequal treatment amongst Salesforce employees, specifically at AE level Internal political nightmare with unjustified promotions Unequal territories with no realistic probability of quota attainment unless provided multiple territories with high AOV band Lack of true sentiment for customer success – Many oversold accounts, unhappy customers and forced purchases encompassing a bullying demeanor Lack of true equality in the workplace – Majority of the Southern California hub is Caucasian, where there is a true lack of diversity, where it appears that minorities are hired to meet quotas Distraught office culture full of fear and lack of “Ohana” despite how Salesforce portrays itself Low compensation compared to fair market value for AE per segment False claims of “equality” (approximately 65% White, 79% Male at Salesforce) Continuous micro-management with call center mentality for tenured Account Executives On a final note, there are some extremely judgmental managers, one specifically who came from the Chicago office. Constant complaining, throwing people under the bus and tattle tale mentality making it a completely uncomfortable work environment and actually having people who would rather quit than put up with ""it""."
4970,5.0,Processes make code commits lengthy.
4971,5.0,The reason why they put so much energy into training is because lots of bureaucracy. I guess being this big its tough to stay PCI compliant so lots of rules to follow. Just need to learn to navigate.
4972,5.0,Very competitive and a lot of great talent. You need to advocate for yourself to get in front of new opportunities/promotions as opposed to being chosen strictly by your performance.

4976,2.0,"Very childish people seem to work here... Coming back from PTO I find that things on my desk have disappeared, only to find that my boss takes them and throws them at people around the office. I often have to duck so I don't get hit by flying objects that he throws when he is angry. My boss is a bully who doesn't believe in company culture, so although we have such great opportunities, I am rarely able to take part in any of them. Pretty disappointed after hearing so many rave reviews about this place."

4980,5.0,"None at this time, since I have only seen positive things."
4981,3.0,"Hybrid Engineering has pros and cons. However, in Indy, the strategy for hybrid transition is causing a significant loss in engineering productivity. First, Pros: 1.) Hybrid engineering has brought more focus on using contemporary tools for automated testing. 2.) This helps in improving system reliability and make developers better at their jobs since testing is not considered an afterthought anymore. 3.) Huge investment in automated testing upfront is a good overall strategy that will help in system scalability and reduce buggy software releases. Cons: 1.) The idea for depending more on automated testing than on manual testing has translated into demanding all manual / semi manual qa testers to learn how to code. 2.) This is the strategy that has not panned out at all. While, the self help tools like online courses, mentoring resources and in-team guidance have been a proactive ongoing effort, this approach is taking massive hits on productivity for developers as well as for testers all around. 3.) You can find developers on any given day spending quite a bit of time (hours at times) going over basic step by step process (over and over again) with the testers to resolve minority non-mission critical bugs. 4.) Testers, especially who are not from a programming background / havent coded in a while, are overwhelmed and stressed out about the tickets they have to complete each sprint. 5.) For a company that champions engineering productivity and no interruption time for developers, developers are spending less time on quality features/innovative/disruptive work and more time getting bogged down by the process+manual testing+ incremental work . Dont get me wrong, the notion of ohana is embedded deep in the organization and engineers are glad to help their peers anytime. However, this is a massive hit on productivity."
4982,5.0,Haven't come across any so far.
4983,4.0,"As I’ve only just started all of my comments are about first impressions, so please take that into consideration. I have gotten the feeling that the company has grown so fast it is suffering from some growing pains. By all means a good problem to have, but it means process workflows can be a bit clunky."
4984,5.0,"Working at previous company, a south bay EHR startup, which was full of favoritism and messy but oh well it was a stepping stone to this"
4985,2.0,"Losing sight of the core values the company was founded on. Growing to fast and not able to keep up with overall growth. Seeing lots and lots of angry current customers... 8/10 if you don't have 5-6+ years of inside/outside sales experience, you will only be considered for an SDR or BDR role. This could be fine, but the role should incorporate more closing of business if you are basically expecting people to take a demotion for the role and not articulating the position clearly (this could just be an issue with my office though). If you are on the BDR team you can be the hardest working person and still not hit your number because of how your quota is attained. Your manager will ""help you"" come up with ""strategic plans"" to hit your number (basically just tell you to make more calls/set meetings) but it doesn't matter because if you AEs refuse the meetings, don't feel like moving them to a stage 2 (everyone perceives what this means differently), don't have time to take them until the next month, etc. then you are screwed. BDR management doesn't align with AE management at all. Therefore, they don't care about anything except their AEs closing deals (I don't blame them!), they are annoyed when BDR management comes complaining that their AEs aren't working with their BDR... This is just not a conducive business model and doesn't help growth initiatives. Not everyone is measured the same. You could be aligned 2-4 AEs or 10-15 AEs as a BDR. Either way, these people are expected to generate the same amount of ""stage 2"" opportunity. If you have 2 AEs that are busy, don't work in your office or don't have the ""need"" for a BDR to generate pipeline - then you have NO chance of hitting your quota. SDRs, BDRs and AE's are all expected to generate their own pipeline - which makes sense but it is causing people to compete with each other which takes away from making the customer #1 priority. This is especially bad since the Mulesoft migration... (from BDR POV) Although Salesforce always talks about endless internal growth opportunities, this is def not something that I have seen to be encouraged. You are pretty much forced to take the typical promotion track. BDR Management is way too pushy with BDRs setting new meetings and business, while this should be a significant responsibility, lots of customers get mislead, forgotten, or treated with poor customer service which eventually will backfire (I have already seen it backfire a few times!) As a BDR you could generate $5mil in the pipeline one month, but only have 2 stage two opptys on the board (you need around 6-8)...which means you will miss your quota. Others could have 6-8 opptys on the board which only adds up to $300k in pipe for the month, but they will hit quota.. Doesn't make sense."
4986,5.0,"-Having to pay for parking each month is a hassle, but it is hard to find a con about this company so far."
4987,5.0,No real cons. The only thing is that it is in San Francisco where the cost of living is through the roof.
4988,5.0,"Large company, with the processes and amount of job titles it implies. Overwhelming amount of information scattered across a lot of systems."
4989,4.0,"Due to the growth, employee working space and privacy are both commodities that are somewhat lacking. How can you concentrate on your job when there is noise and distraction so plentiful? Over the summer, some workers are literally shoulder to shoulder."

4993,1.0,"(marketing cloud) Not a good place to get anything done. It has become too big of a bloated ship to steer. People with inflated titles coming in with no knowledge of the space or customers - and no desire to learn. They just come in, prioritize the wrong projects and don't listen to the people who have been there for years and know what is actually important. I've seen it many times and became disgusted, ultimately deciding to leave. The CEO (Bob) likes to yell and has a shoot first, ask questions mentality - extremely disruptive and people are leaving in droves because of him."
4994,4.0,Experience can vary widely based on what team you are on

4998,3.0,"If you're already very disciplined, have a strong presence and can articulate technical challenges in a manner that relates to business impact, salesforce may be too slow a path for you."
4999,5.0,- I am not sure what promotion opportunities/career path looks like for me at this time but with the speed and scale of growth I am hopeful for more opportunities for me in the future
5000,5.0,None that I can think of.
5001,2.0,"No career path or growth and terrible compensation. Nobody has a clear Understanding of responsibilities. Terrible management, there is little to no support from them. Low morale as a result of all of this."
5002,1.0,As far as a sales job goes it is one of the worst I have ever experienced. The territories or account decks are not distributed evenly and there are only a handful of sales people succeeding despite the incredible numbers reported to Wall Street. Managers DO NOT coach; their only job is to manage your pipeline so you are left to out there on your own. As a result turn over is higher than anything I have ever seen
5003,5.0,I change managers two times a year. It seems like there are a lot of shuffling within middle management.
5004,5.0,- On boarding is a bit overwhelming...but thats normal anywhere. They do the best job they can making you feel welcome. I was happy with my on boarding.

5007,4.0,"It's extremely fast paced. Your expected to be available most of the time, given notice. For instance, it's not uncommon to have calls with teams in other countries at night. I've been on calls that started as late as 10pm EST."
5008,4.0,"cons will always depend on your group, team and manager"
5009,5.0,Very different from the ad agency model. Difficult on-boarding. Sometimes the sheer size of the company gets in its own way.

5012,5.0,"typical growing pains, but fierce focus on customer-centricity and employee success"
5013,2.0,"Mid Market AE’s get 8 total install accounts, only 2-3 of which will actually buy anything, particularly on the west coast (very small amount of accounts compared to Mid Market territories at other companies). I’ve seen lots of highly successful AEs come to Salesforce and leave after less then a year after being dealt TERRIBLE territories mostly due to lots of upset oversold customers with lots of shelfware. Also, lots of poor implementations due to prior AEs not insisting on customers bringing in business partners when they should have because they just wanted to close deals....Many customers who look good on paper aren’t buying anything for these reasons....in many cases hard work has nothing to do with hitting your number - if you don’t have good/satisfied install accounts in your territory (total toss up btw) there is no path to success whatsoever as decent net new logo deals are few and far between (in Mid Market) - the expectation at Salesforce is that you won’t hit your number - you’ve been warned... Culture is another toss up depending on the RVP - they preach “Ohana” but in lots of cases it should be “nohana” - be VERY careful if you are looking at a job in one of the the coprime aka overlay AE divisions as it can be very toxic if your product set isn’t service cloud....be sure to really feel out your managers leadership style before you take one of these roles because there really are some brutally awful RVPs. If the RVP you are interviewing with is brand new to Salesforce CAUTION Terrible new AE product enablement - they give you marketing fluff and that’s it"
5014,5.0,"The company is growing and with that comes some bottlenecks in getting things done. For it's size though, it is still incredible how fast Salesforce is still able to innovate."
5015,5.0,None that I can think of besides a common tech company perk - food
5016,5.0,Several years into my career at Salesforce and I can't think of one specific to my current role. Is that cheesy? Maybe. Is it honest? Absolutely.
5017,3.0,"Fake culture - depending on your department, all the ""best place to work"" image isn't true. Salesforce spends a lot of money making the company look amazing but internally, they don't treat their employees that great (depending on department of course). Company also wastes a lot of money on frivolous things just to add to this image"
5018,3.0,"Forcing all employees at a location to attend the all-hands in person by not providing conference call information shows how desperate this ""head of technology"" to fill the room."
5019,5.0,Our internal complexities are sometimes difficult to shield from customers.

5021,5.0,I do not have any cons
5022,4.0,"- Hierarchical - Young, undeveloped management team - Over saturated sales talent pool"
5023,1.0,Has become political and unable to live up to its innovation aspirations.
5024,5.0,I have been working in Salesforce for the past 5 years and I have not found any cons working there till now
5025,3.0,"Inconsistent people practices - Too many sales leaders in here are focused only on deals and volume of metrics versus quality work, what's best for the customer, and their people. What about the hearts and minds people, you just might be surprised. Relatively weak enablement - our own instance is a mess and not optimized for us to truly succeed the way we should be. I shouldn't be embarrassed to show my cluttered configuration. Compensation appears to be getter lower and lower around me - only a few appear to be making great money, the rest end up either just ok, but more frequently I'm hearing that other AE's have to take on debt in their so called ""Dreamjob"". Am I next? Give us back some reasonable territory please."
5026,5.0,"Like all companies, there comes time to grind it out and work overtime. Although, it is not often but worth the rewards."
5027,5.0,"Making hubs more corporate, less like the local culture."
5028,5.0,There really aren't any I can think of.
5029,5.0,Not as nimble as smaller organisations.
5030,5.0,"Overwhelming information and excellent learning possibilities, however you have to focus again and again to become a Salesforce ninja in your core areas and then keep on going learning from minute one in every possible minute of your daytime otherwise your quickly lost."
5031,4.0,Sales numbers often take precedence over actual customer needs.
5032,5.0,"Personal con is that my commute takes now longer. Luckly, Salesforce provides shuttles to/from SF."
5033,5.0,There are no downsides to working at Salesforce!
5034,5.0,Not a great fit for people who prefer to work in very small teams and companies.
5035,5.0,Things move at a face pace. It's not for everyone but I find it to be a lot of fun
5036,5.0,Extremely fast faced environment can sometimes overwhelming. If you are not good at managing your time and producing output quickly it will be a challenge.
5037,5.0,The security that Salesforce puts on laptops makes it hard to do certain things but it's a tradeoff.
5038,1.0,-Incompetent people with titles as 'research scientist' and 'research engineers' -You would instantly lose attraction to companies like Google/Facebook/Apple/Amazon if you go here. Common perception is that they hire lazy low-tier engineers/scientist -Many of the 'researchers/research scientists' do not even have a PhD. They are students/friends of the people in management who hire them without rigorous interviews - You won't learn anything since there is no innovation going on here. This will be problematic if you try to get a job at a real company and they ask you about your past experience.
5039,5.0,Not many but commute if you dont live in SF and WFH policy is very subjective to manager . Majority of Managers are totally kool with it but their are few who dont like it
5040,5.0,"The innovative culture is starting to be tainted by the recent ""Big Company"" feel and imported Sr. Management from Oracle. Very hard driving culture leads for little to no work/life balance."
5041,5.0,Comp plan lacks clarity and alignment to results
5042,5.0,Really not much to say here. Even if I did not get the job I would have just applied again until I got it.
5043,5.0,"Unpredictable hours, cyclical with high demands in Q4, YMMV by department. Advancement-hungry middle management can apply unnecessary pressures and derail individual trajectory in many ways. Potential for short-term outlook to negatively impact book of business long term. Top down management principals need to better discriminate by market segment."
5044,4.0,Some people are not nice.

5048,5.0,"The company is growing and with that comes some bottlenecks in getting things done. For it's size though, it is still incredible how fast Salesforce is still able to innovate."
5049,3.0,"Promotions and seniority is completely based on tenure at the company and relationships. CSG is specially dysfunctional - too many people doing busy work and not really being productive. As someone who has over 25 years of experience, I feel like people should be doing a lot more, and recognition should be more forthcoming."
5050,4.0,"- Fast pace and high pressure are a common thread throughout the company, which can make it hard to balance the demands of family life"

5053,5.0,People can be extremely competitive.
5054,5.0,nothing that comes to mind
5055,5.0,No complaints. Great place to work at!
5056,4.0,Politics and aggressive culture. Managers aren't well trained and sales trump long-term strategy or product direction. Values are inconsistently practiced depending on which area you work in.
5057,5.0,It is becoming very large and lots of people will struggle to feel the same excitement as they did when they joined.
5058,4.0,EXTREMELY fast-paced and sometimes disorganized.
5059,1.0,"If you're a Software Engineer looking to learn new technologies, create innovative technical solutions, or grow your career, I cannot stress to you enough to RUN AWAY from any opportunities at Salesforce Indy. The company culture would have you believe that Security/Trust trumps everything. Development machines are tightly locked down, and access to new technologies requires a multi-level approval process that can take months. While Security teams claim to ""partner"" with engineering teams, they impose security restrictions without any input from engineering and require layers of ""evidence"" as to why a restriction should be lifted (we're talking simple things like installing Docker). I was once told that ""Powershell is banned, access to it is completely forbidden"". Furthermore, the company claims to be Agile and is anything but. This is typical for large companies with internal software teams, but frankly I expected more from a company like Salesforce. User stores and bugs are tied back to epics that are ""committed"" to specific releases. They require stories that tie back outlining the project from start to finish, and individual stories are broken down further into ""tasks"" that really just lead to a tedious ""check the box"" workflow for most projects. If for some reason the project doesn't make it in the committed epic, prepare to be asked by multiple layers of management as to why it was dropped/delayed. If you're a developer looking for a 9-5 gig with the best benefits in town and an easy-going atmosphere, this might be for you. If you're a developer that wants to work with newer technologies and create truly innovative solutions to existing problems, look elsewhere. This job will not help you develop a better skillset, it will not help you work with newer tech, and it certainly won't allow you to come anywhere close to creating innovative solutions."
5060,5.0,"The work can be demanding, requiring 60 and 70 hour weeks at times depending on the season (business reviews, product launches, events, etc.)."
5061,4.0,Had no idea what they bought that led to massive layoffs.
5062,1.0,"First, It is very much the same old type of network. Don't be taken in by the facade of empowering women. It is just one step off Weinstein-like mentality (there is no harassment of that type but the mentality is ""women, know your place"".) What I specifically mean is this: men have a way of doing the Sales, R&D, IT, and programs like Ignite. Women have to scurry along and just make nice. You dare not speak up. Some small amount of benign questioning will be ""allowed"". If you really challenge the unproductive practices, a swarm of managers and their managers and their managers will put you on ""employee success"" plan. This goes on your HR records. Once it does, you cannot transfer, get promoted, get a letter to attend Business School or get a good reference to go to another company. A multitude of other good things you might have done and your hard work will go down the drain. It makes people suicidal. This culture does not understand that this job is food on our table. Second, many former Google, Facebook, Nvidia, Microsoft and 5 Agency employees are welcome if they just about have a pulse. Hence, high ranking executives will come one or two days to work; will not have full comprehension of client's current/future stages; treat all engineers as inferior; and publicly chide team members. Third, Veterans are hired in droves. Hiring is all they do. That is all. Then a handful of hyper-gamified, substance-less Trails are thrown at them along with a ""mentor"" program. Most new hires, especially veterans, struggle between not knowing how to navigate the million tools and the embarrassment of asking colleagues on how to do things. Fourth, Salesforce attracts prospective employees in with a seemingly high pay. But, a large part of that is commission or bonus. IT IS IMPOSSIBLE to attain quota or utilization. This is another way for managers to crack the ."
5063,5.0,None. Everything is great about this company.
5064,5.0,There should be free food :(
5065,5.0,Some legacy code Alcohol is gone :(
5066,5.0,Product management leadership focused on flash instead of substance
5067,5.0,"Lots of internal politics, no surprise at any big company this isn't Salesforce specific it happens everywhere. Promos are about timing mainly."
5068,4.0,We spend more time being account managers than we do selling; and the web to solving customer problems is so massive that it takes weeks to find answers.
5069,4.0,"They will pay for you to get certifications, but it can be hard to get hired without having one or more Salesforce certifications, Trailhead training badges, or a Linkedin profile that really shows you are ready to provide great customer support."
5070,5.0,"Some high stress moments, but otherwise great-"
5071,5.0,I haven't found a con yet
5072,5.0,Pay is a little low
5073,5.0,IT could reduce the number of communication tools.

5075,5.0,With insane year over year growth inevitably comes growing pains.
5076,1.0,"Salesforce is the most toxic organization I have ever worked for, and I've worked for a lot of organizations as both an FTE, contractor, and consultant over the past two decades. Trying to pare down what I want to warn others of is difficult. I'll just bullet it out and you can decide what would wear you down, disrupt your sleep, and leave you paranoid, the most. - 1:1s with senior management where the most hateful things are said about your character, etc., and then afterward, the manager acts as though it never happened. -Pressure to give Salesforce a glowing Glassdoor rating after less than 30 days at the company when you do not know enough to provide an accurate review. - No written reviews, something called a 9 box where management provides their opinion of you and tells you it exists but then says you are never allowed to see it, per H/R. - If you want to apply for an internal position, you must have your manager's permission first. If you tell your manager you want to apply for the role and he/she does not want to lose you, he/she just says, no, you do not have my permission. Game over, you are going no where. - If you are allowed a desk (many have to submit to hoteling and never knowing where they will sit day to day), no personal plants, photos, or non SF toys allowed. They want a uniform look to the desks. -Forced volunteerism, if you do not log your 50 hour minimum of volunteer hours per year, you will be shamed at team meetings. Doesn't matter if you have kids, sick parents, 60 hour work week, whatever, you are expected to make the minimum. -No criticism of Benioff permitted. And don't ever say out loud that you found it disturbing to see a laying on of hands and someone praying over him as though he were a prophet at an internal company meeting. Management will quickly remind you that he is leading the 4th industrial revolution and he is the leading mind of our time. -If you are managing young hourly employees, be prepared to be instructed that you are to tell them they MUST go to team dinners, volunteer events, and SF ""fun"" activities but this is not work, so they don't get paid. If you push back, you will be reprimanded for ""not being Ohana."" - Teams are run by popularity. Backstabbing, shaming, and shunning are used to get the teams to stay quiet about how bad things are. People who speak out about behaviors, lack of professionalism, etc. are labeled, ""unOhana"" and told that they are not acting like family. - When you interview and you take a position, there is ZERO guarantee that the role you interviewed for and were hired for is the role you will be doing. The management opinion is to hire highly qualified people, they will be so grateful to be permitted to work at Salesforce, they will do whatever job we give them. I kid you not, you may have more than a decade of experience, be highly technical, have managed teams, and be hired for a technical role, then be told you are going to do data entry level work and you will be glad you are permitted to be at this company doing that. -If you are uncomfortable participating in some public events, e.g. parades, events, etc., and SF is participating in one, there is incredible pressure to spend your weekend in the parade or event. The expectation is that Salesforce and its needs come first. I cannot stress this enough, you are told that Salesforce is YOUR family and your family comes first. A lack of loyalty to the company will get penalized far more significantly and quicker than complete incompetence, maliciousness, or even harassment. Salesforce demands absolute devotion."
5077,2.0,"The work hours are long, and practically no work life balance. The projects are mismanaged and teams that are doing well and good are reorged for no apparent reason. There is also little recognition at a job well done. Managers treat employees as commodities. They stunt the growth of senior members and bring in new grads to add pressure and get work done."
5078,5.0,"On the verge of becoming a larger company. As such, trying to balance encouraging entrepreneurship with requirements of scaling as a large enterprise. A lot of snap decisions are made in terms of business goals, metrics and expectations without discussion of a larger roadmap on the departmental level or larger business context."
5079,4.0,"Getting started is still rough. Weeks of training, setting up your computer, waiting for other people to give you access to resources you need, and finding out information about anything is tough. We use chatter and google docs to keep track of random information like where to get a company phone or what API to use for integration with such and such. But both resources are a conglomeration of obsolete and inapplicable information. While we do pride ourselves on having an open culture, it isn't necessarily a very exciting, friendly or personal culture. You're generally free to do what you like, but many (maybe most) teams don't go to lunch together and aren't friends with each other. They just have small talk and do what it takes to get the job done well. Since your team is who you're with all day and who you talk to most of the time, it's kind of important. I wish it was the other way around, where my team was wanted to talk too much and spend more time hanging out than I did. The employees are kind of old here, so it's just not what I'm used to I suppose. Also, spoiled as I already am here, I will always be jealous of companies that have free cafeterias because I can't cook."
5080,5.0,There is no free lunch :(
5081,2.0,"Mid Market AE’s get 8 total install accounts, only 2-3 of which will actually buy anything, particularly on the west coast (very small amount of accounts compared to Mid Market territories at other companies). I’ve seen lots of highly successful AEs come to Salesforce and leave after less then a year after being dealt TERRIBLE territories mostly due to lots of upset oversold customers with lots of shelfware. Also, lots of poor implementations due to prior AEs not insisting on customers bringing in business partners when they should have because they just wanted to close deals....Many customers who look good on paper aren’t buying anything for these reasons....in many cases hard work has nothing to do with hitting your number - if you don’t have good/satisfied install accounts in your territory (total toss up btw) there is no path to success whatsoever as decent net new logo deals are few and far between (in Mid Market) - the expectation at Salesforce is that you won’t hit your number - you’ve been warned... Culture is another toss up depending on the RVP - they preach “Ohana” but in lots of cases it should be “nohana” - be VERY careful if you are looking at a job in one of the the coprime aka overlay AE divisions as it can be very toxic if your product set isn’t service cloud....be sure to really feel out your managers leadership style before you take one of these roles because there really are some brutally awful RVPs. If the RVP you are interviewing with is brand new to Salesforce CAUTION Terrible new AE product enablement - they give you marketing fluff and that’s it"
5082,2.0,"extremely cliquish for new comers. Employees are lifers and move around departments with little to no experience in new roles, then ignore expertise of outsiders brought in. VERY cutthroat environment. Wants results yesterday with no regard to planning."
5083,4.0,"repeatedly cutting back perks (breakfasts, lunches, team outings, massage therapist), not agile software delivery (3 hard deadline releases per year), very limited travel even with valid reasons, attempting to corporatize/homogenize everything in the office (bland white walls, very stock image-type 'culture galleries', nothing can be customized to the city the office is in), work is becoming more high-stress with arbitrary limitations on how you can perform your job, many layers of research required before being able to implement changes due to overly complex/legacy nature of the software monolith"
5084,4.0,"Office Sucks really bad (NYC 3rd ave) . They have a call center layout so you're sitting side by side next to someone for 8+ hours with absolutely no sense of privacy for 8 + hours.

""what are you eating, who are you on the phone with, what are you doing , where are you going, etc etc..."" Horrendous. The office air quality is poor, the desks are old and the tiny desk partitions are small and dirty looking. Hopefully the Tower will be better."

5091,4.0,"Marketing Cloud, at least, is still going through transition pains years after acquisition. Many processes have not worked out kinks yet, and it felt like San Francisco dictated to our office without taking into consideration our unique needs. During my time in Marketing Cloud Support, we were extremely under-staffed, with a discouragement of using overtime and yet we had to call every customer, every day, and provide them with a two-hour window during which we could call. I have been told that since I left rules have become even stricter. With tight SLAs, little overtime available, and a severe lack of staff, employees were extremely stressed and turnover became a real problem. We did not feel that the company cared whether the requirements of the job were impossible to perform in an 8-hour day. The team that existed when I left earlier this year looks nothing like the current team because of people feeling they had to leave to get out of the situation. Team leads and managers in Indianapolis were as supportive as they could be given the situation and pressure on them as well. My team often felt that we had no agency in this issue, as leaders in Indianapolis could do nothing against the executives in San Francisco making decisions for us."
5092,5.0,It can feel like a large company at times with red tape.
5093,3.0,"Because Salesforce is growing so fast – doubling its workforce and revenue over two years – many things get lost in the shuffle. Some teams have crushing workloads, while others are virtually forgotten. The prevailing infrastructure of the company is a parochial network of vice presidents operating independently. This leads to disconnection, and occasionally chaos. Teams duplicate work, work in contradictory directions, and compete pointlessly. Territoriality for budget and resources is rampant. There are no centralized checks and balances. If you have a bad or unethical warlord, you may be asked to do things that are counterproductive or even hurtful. The patchwork of fiefdoms across the company is so disconnected that many teams are unaware of similar teams within the company. Efforts to organize or connect strategies are met with resistance and sometimes hostility. A chief strategy officer with a team of connected project managers could address this, but many VPs don't want accountability. The result is work that doesn't rise above mediocrity. Salesforce is a great company comprised of dozens of mediocre companies. Those mediocre companies don't want to connect and be great because their leaders don't want to lose status. Once you see that you can't unsee it. Many workers grow cynical as a result. The famed ""Ohana"" (Hawaiian for family) doesn't penetrate the 300-yard stare of hardened coworkers who don't say hello in elevators."
5094,1.0,"- Every year Marc and Keith think it's ok to slash our pay and make it difficult to make any money. - 10% of AE's hit their annual number and OTE at SB and GRB segments - No enablement - Hire to many externals that have ZERO clue how to run an evaluation clogging up the promotional timeline for internal employees trying to advance. - Lowest Salary and Compensation in the market - even though we have the most expensive product - Keith Block is turning Salesforce into Oracle and culture and talent is fiercely diminishing. - No one is happy besides Upper Level Management - People go into management for wrong reasons (maternity leave so they can get 80% of OTE and be out office for 6-8 months providing no value to team and having no pressure of individual quota) - Marc uses Salesforce as a platform to promote his ridiculous political beliefs alienating all republican employees. - 50K base salary - Sales Ops and Finance dont pay people on time....EVER.. takes month for you're pay to reflect your title in Xactly. - Cant log the amount of hours you work because ""You should be able to get your job done working only 40 hrs"" They dont want to pay us. - They pay us like dogs and expect the world from us - Every year your territory shrinks, Quota's go up...Managment response is since we acquired more companies, new products should make up for added quota. - Internal recruiters do absolutely nothing to get anyone internally promoted (still unsure what they do all day) - Did I mention we only make 50K base?!!"
5095,4.0,"The pace is sometimes overwhelming, but no different than any other startup - still that mentality after 20 years. Benefits could be better. The peer certifications are exhausting and a requirement for going to the next level in all SE positions- some managers are less strict than others - pray you get one of those!"
5096,2.0,"The company moves at a fast and relentless pace, don't expect a break. There is great pressure to keep the leadership position in the industry and employees feel this each day with the amount of work expected of them."
5097,4.0,"Innovation means constant change - not all employees can succeed in the environment, it's very demanding. Chaotic environment, less experienced management team. Focus is on growth. Some infrastructure in place but it's not the priority."
5098,4.0,"Their engineering practices are still evolving and are somewhat primitive. Most of the technical staff are from a small number of places, and don't seem to have a lot of perspective on what they're doing."
5099,5.0,"Sometimes the work can be overwhelming, but between release, it's heaven."
5100,3.0,- Does not like to change very much. Likes to stick with old technology. - People sitting on temporary desks. Spacing issues. seriously salesforce????? - No pay increases per year. They don't promote you based on your performance. Some low performers getting promotions and other hard workers staying at the current positions for years.
5101,4.0,"Not many cons, great company."
5102,5.0,Location if you leave outside of San Francisco.
5103,5.0,none I couldn't find any cons till now
5104,5.0,More red tape than they convey. Strong emphasis put on tenure over job performance
5105,4.0,"The following below is a reflection of the company: - Acquired a bunch of companies, especially during 2015 - 2016 which made career advancement tough. - Constant changes and initiatives being rolled out that makes it challenging to adjust quickly The following below is a reflection of the team: - Onboarding experience wasn't that great. I had to figure out how to maneuver around the system by myself often - There wasn't really a culture on the team. A lot of people kept to themselves which made it hard to build rapport. Integrating members from acquisitions also was a bit awkward as there wasn't any announcement / formal introductions. - Difficult to advance and grow within the organization as the company was growing so quickly. - The work you put in in terms of recruiting, events, VTO, etc.. can sometimes be overlooked since the org was so big. You may get lost in the shuffle - There were a lot of questions about leveling that the organization leaders were working on right before I left."
5106,4.0,- Managers micromanage. This is a very metrics driven org where KPIs are assessed every week. - Territories are getting smaller and smaller - OTE is achievable but it's hard to hit your monthly quota month over month.
5107,4.0,Cannot think of any.
5108,4.0,"Confined to a team, Not easy to transition."
5109,4.0,Many people work from home regularly --> fewer face-to-face collaboration
5110,4.0,"Lots of good people are leaving in droves, Salesforce has become the epitome of corporate bureaucracy when it comes to process killing innovation, product has many dated aspects and is not innovating to be truly competitive in the space, the bean counters are taking over with layoffs and consolidations being labeled as efficiencies or things that are ""best for the business"", roadmaps and direction shift constantly, product managers and their teams are sometimes left to work from their own roadmaps until ""grand plans"" are solidified and communicated down"

5114,5.0,Fast paced environment - Must be a self starter.
5115,5.0,I can't think of any cons. If you work hard and play hard you can find an amazing balance and success here at Salesforce.
5116,5.0,Always getting bigger (change is slower at times) Some employees don't appreciate how great it is
5117,1.0,No different than working for an Intel or IBM other than the walls are just more colorful. Overbearing micro-managing bosses that treat you as just a object. An engineering culture of scoffing at work-life balance. Outdated infrastructure.
5118,5.0,"Lots of change, sometimes too much too fast."
5119,5.0,Ramp up is painful at the beginning.
5120,5.0,Recently there have been what appear to be missteps on the transparency front. There is a distributed/remote policy that management's not able to clearly articulate and communication has been very spotty to the people affected. I have faith that the company will properly communicate the final decision but months of waiting without any substantial progress doesn't seem very Salesforce-like.
5121,5.0,- I honestly cannot think of anything I would like to change at this company
5122,2.0,"It's Like College: there are a lot of bright engineers with wonderful, though impractical, theories, and operations often suffers due to a lack of people with more grounded, experienced perspectives It's Like College...you can even graduate early: If you're promoted, you're even more likely to stay less than four years, being a VP in operations is like being the drummer in Spinal Tap, you'll mysteriously leave one day and be replaced by someone else...who will also also leave under bizarre circumstances in 9 months It's Like College: when you make it to five years, you start to feel like all your friends have graduated and moved on, and you're the old guy telling stories about 2009 It's Like College: much of the technology the company uses was developed when I was still a university student It's Like College: there's a lot of unusual PR that's used to help sell the place to new recruits It's Like College...in North Korea: Your job is a dream! Post that to your Facebook and LinkedIn, and do it now!"
5123,5.0,"None at this time, but work-life balance is something to consider, as this is a high-pressure job with high expectations. As long as that is considered beforehand, there should not be any surprises."
5124,5.0,Still got a lot of growing to do so is somewhat tactical compared to other enterprise software companies. If you join - come planning on helping to create solutions not follow someone else's plan
5125,5.0,"- big company so work feels specialized - so many interns spread throughout multiple buildings, made it harder to meet new people"
5126,5.0,"The only con is that if you are under 21 you cant drink, and drinking is a big part of their company culture."
5127,5.0,"Very fast-paced, reactive culture may be difficult for some."
5128,5.0,"It's an enterprise software company, i.e. the product doesn't necessarily impact the world in a meaningful way but it is a great product! The 1:1:1 model helps this 'con' though."
5129,5.0,"It does take some work to navigate larger tasks like expense reports and benefits, but that is to be expected at such a large company and there are plenty of resources to help."
5130,5.0,"Fast moving with the training and projects, seems a bit like drinking from a firehose."
5131,5.0,None so far. Nones so far. That's one way to meed the 5 word minimum
5132,4.0,"Lack of diversity in management, especially C-Suite. Retention of people of color is appalling. It's hard to find a person of color who is an a management-level or higher position."

5140,5.0,- Organizational change is difficult. Everything changes every month on the Marketing Cloud Support team. This will calm down as the Marketing Cloud assimilates further into Salesforce practices.
5141,2.0,Sales Management is driven to grow at all costs. Culture of the firm is very positive and philanthropic messages are very positive however the maniacal need to grow 50% y/y puts customer success in second position over deal completion. The growth messages are coupled with sales culture that is not long term relationship (Trusted Advisor) messaging that the overall company convey's to the market.
5142,5.0,new building in SF has its design flaws.
5143,5.0,An atmosphere where things are always changing can present challenges in trying to keep pace.
5144,5.0,None that I can think of
5145,5.0,- Very corporate environment - This can lead to a lot of 'office politics' which could be viewed as either a pro or con - Less than competitive compensation
5146,4.0,"Salesforce is behind on Data Science. The leadership does not yet promote the technical infrastructure, institutional support, or data literacy to carry out modern data science."
5147,5.0,"Some growing pains but they recognize and act upon it quickly, rather than blaming employees Employees work hard here, yet management emphasizes wellness to avoid burnout"
5148,5.0,Not for everyone Monthly Cadence Lots of Pressure

5151,4.0,Don't get to know the team before you join

5153,5.0,High turnover in sales management. Job satisfaction dependent on direct manager. Sales driven organisation
5154,3.0,"I feel the need to share this because I don't believe I was given an honest picture of Salesforce when I was interviewed for my role: * It is a fast paced, frenetic, competitive workplace. If you're good with that and you are hungry to be #1, this is your company. * You need to stay high energy and never take your eye off the ball. Early on, you need to ""establish your brand"" or you will disappear in the malaise of communication and collaboration."

5159,5.0,Big change of human resource management happened while I was interning.
5160,5.0,Environment is intense and sales has monthly quotas which is intense.
5161,5.0,For me at-least commute is too long. Everything is perfect. no other cons i could think off.
5162,1.0,"- Was sold to me as a ""strategy job"" but don't be fooled this is 80% sales ops - The hours, you work like you're in a start-up without any of the equity - Pay is low for this type of role, even in comparison to most start-ups - The team is very short staffed and cannot handle the workload it's constantly given - The systems used are terrible, slow and outdated. Performance issues with the analytics tools can easily add 2-3 hours to your day. - I really can't stress enough how bad the hours are"
5163,3.0,"The culture has changed, I joined two years ago and there was such a great air of optimism no matter who you talked to, now that air has been deflated from the company. It is quickly changing into a slow corporate culture."
5164,4.0,Leadership in some orgs is questionable. Too much red tape required to make process changes. Any changes passed tended to be from those that had personal friendships with leadership.
5165,3.0,"Very strong politics and somewhat negative orientation in the market for their customers. Rely on big services and other upsells. Widely varying levels of success depending on the integration partner. NOT focused on new features and innovation, but milking the existing stack for maximum revenue."
5166,4.0,"Why is drinking such a big part of the company culture? It saddens me that even a below-21 intern feels he/she can't participate fully in the ""culture"" because drinking is such a ""big part"" of it, as seen in a recent Glassdoor review. I don't drink for health reasons, and I often feel like work events (holiday parties, team celebrations, Dreamforce) are less rewarding for me because the non-alcoholic choices are an afterthought. Can I have a $20 gift card instead?! I've seen a lot of employees misbehaving and embarrass themselves through alcohol. Time to cut back. Alcohol is not the same thing as a company culture. Second, I have no illusions that working remotely is a perfect situation. I know I miss out on a lot in the office and I am ok with it. That said, I think the company could do more to make Salesforce better for non-SF members of the Ohana. I also think there should be better career paths for those who are not managers. Because I'm remote, I have been told I don't have much room to move up since I can't manage remotely (even though my manager manages me remotely... and that seems to work fine). The company expects so much of us during Dreamforce (12+ hour days for a week), but we never see any time off as a result of that."
5167,5.0,"Work life balance can be hard. If you don't like ongoing change, it is not the company for you :)"
5168,3.0,- lower level management is poor in regards to management skills - weak H.R department when it comes to representing employees concerns - a TON of politics to deal with
5169,5.0,I have nothing negative to say.
5170,5.0,Some of the onboarding and process documentation is lacking.
5171,4.0,None at this point. Might be little hectic based on what work your are doing.
5172,4.0,Difficult to change roles internally.
5173,5.0,"Not many I can think of truthfully. Salesforce is a large company, so a lot is happening around you. It's up to you to stay up on things as they move."
5174,1.0,management is incompetent. many of the staff are incompetent. the titles are very much over inflated. They blatantly do not protect customer data. They place emphasis on loyalty over experience and expertise. They are very discriminatory.
5175,5.0,Big learning curve in learning the technology. Behind the state of the art in some areas. Possible to get lost in big organization.
5176,5.0,Cannot think of any cons at this point.
5177,5.0,HR can be a little slow
5178,5.0,- Company kind of slowing down on innovating new things. Market is moving so fast. Competitors are growing everyday. We might need to speed up a little.
5179,5.0,"Work Load, nothing else I can think of"
5180,4.0,small territories can limit earnings
5181,5.0,Pace of change is exhausting sometimes!
5182,5.0,"Community culture or not, business is still business which means ultimately decisions will always get made for the business first."
5183,2.0,"If you are looking at Salesforce...stay away from the retail team. Leadership within this group is non-existent. Often times they talk out of both sides of their mouth. This is not a group that cares about the customer. They care about growth, growth and growth. Retail and Consumer Packaged Goods is a ""boys club"" plain and simple. If you are looking to join Salesforce, make sure you have a strong leader. and, ask to speak with other people on the team under the Regional Vice President of the team you are looking to join."
5184,5.0,None. We work very hard :).
5185,3.0,too many changes too fast
5186,5.0,Nothing I can think of....lol
5187,5.0,Very Fast Moving High Expectations Competitive Challenging Big
5188,4.0,Inside sales is high pressure and a lot of call center type of sales

5190,4.0,It's a lot of work
5191,5.0,"Fire drills. Our company is rapidly growing and we are constantly innovating, which is great! But, it also means that the game plan last year is different from this year's approach. There are fire drills, and strategy shifts. The culture is supportive to the needs of working parents, family needs, personal issues... but anyone considering Salesforce should know... you'll see a few fire drills now and again."
5192,5.0,Rapid growth is making alignment and prioritization more challenging.
5193,4.0,"A LOT of middle management. Too many 'bosses' and C-level execs accumulated from all the company acquisitions...way too much 'fat', too many cooks in the kitchen and any other metaphor you can add here."
5194,5.0,nothing ...... ...... ...... ......
5195,1.0,Middle line Management discriminates against women. Set male counter parts up for success with better accounts and slam dunk opportunities. Derogatory comments against sexuality and being women is tolerated. Good Faith complaints do not hold water. Only a very few percentage of sales account eexecutives actually make their quota and are making accelerators. Quotas and territories are not consistent and products and messaging in Marketing Cloud have failed year over year. Employee Success/HR protects Management team. Do not use this process as it means nothing.
5196,5.0,Nothing really anything to add here
5197,3.0,"- The sales teams tend to be very young. This leads to a very clicky, high school type environment. A lot of drinking in the office and gossiping about other co workers. - A lot of people are more focused on networking to climb the ladder than on their current jobs. - Underpays for industry. - Territories are not divided evenly. They tend to play favorites with the best accounts. But everyone has the same goals."
5198,5.0,Not the best on-boarding/training....didn't feel very supported throughout my time as I actually began doing the job. I was often times told to read articles or ask someone else vs. being offered assistance from my manager or direct team
5199,5.0,I haven't experienced many negatives throughout my time at Salesforce but I understand it's a different experience for each employee. There is of course a substantial amount of change but it's part of the natural evolution of a company innovating and growing at this rate.
5200,5.0,Since I'm not located in a hub office or HQ the visibility with management and opportunities for advancement seem less.
5201,3.0,"- Its not engineering company, let me clear, this is Sales/Market, they do it very well and they are great at it and they know it very well. - Half finished products, over marketed to kill competitors - Work at google/facebook, you realize the products they realize are how developers first, and how salesforce products are 'Sales' first - Work Life Balance - You better be ready to for it, you get burned out so easily, because of repeated release you are always in deadline and pressure to finish. Upper management in Evangelist Team should be engineers Dreamforce : Life is hell for employees, ready to work late hours, when I say, its mean 1 am in night and back again by 8am (Though excitement of carnival keep your motivated) - Salary low comparison to other competitors, you make more as Salesforce lead in other companies than salesforce itself - Stop politics in upper management, learn from Facebook/Google - Slow growth in Developer Relations/ Evangelist Team, you work hard, hard and hard and smart speakers takes the credit, you will be give 'bare minimum credit' of what you innovated or created from scratch - It is not an engineering company, you won't see real engineers in Facebook/Google for the most, they are innovative but deadline is more important that robust technologies, so clearly yes its not proper engineering company - Ask this question, how much Salesforce is used inside (Technical Evangelist) team, they know the platform is limited, but go in dreamforce, you see whole different story - Working both outside and inside Salesforce, I see major flaws in marketing of products and they way they actually are, clients are super pissed because of repeated and constant updates and low backward compatibility, they purchase and are stuck"

5205,5.0,I have been here almost a year and still haven't found any.
5206,5.0,"Fast-paced, very innovative. Great environment for someone who can think on their feet but not if you are not adaptive to change."
5207,5.0,The company has grown tremendously in past few years. Sometimes it feels like a massive company in terms of the number of the people.
5208,5.0,Travel kills if you don't live in SFO city.
5209,2.0,"Broken promises: I was assured when I came on-board that the job was a contract-to-hire, but after the initial contract period was over, I was extended on the same contract and told that no full-time would be available. I was also told upon my initial visit to the office that I'd be visiting the office in-person several times a year, but after 7 months, there is no repeat visit on the horizon, so I feel very disconnected from the team. The only thing we actually do is build a web app that helps people send out marketing e-mails. I was excited about being part of something big that sets the industry standard, but I eventually figured out that couldn't care less for the company's product. My manager was changed halfway through my contract to a person who is a great coder but who has virtually no management experience, and she had two modes: ignore me completely and tell me everything is great, or micromanage my work with a critical eye and tell me I am going too slow and I don't deserve to bill for a full week. It didn't seem like she was capable of paying attention in a way that was really supportive. The last complaint I have is that priority decisions were made in a very top-down way without an intelligent eye on the effectiveness of work that's being done. Lots of automation coverage was built around medium to low priority test cases that were decided arbitrarily, while outstanding known defects and other important things were ignored."
5210,2.0,"Management - Many Managers, Few Leaders - Moral is low. Few are making quota. Micro management is pervasive. Management wants to own all the deals and tell AE's what to do and how to do it. There is no trust in the AE's ability to drive a deal to close. Management attempts to drive rep behavior by fear and focusing too much on the volume of activity. There is a lack of focus on being out in territory vs volume of remote calls / meetings. Management needs to do a better job of using the app to reference next steps and activity. AE's are asked to repeat what is already in the app and often a waste of time and meetings. Quota Attainment and Resources - Very few people are hitting quota and throwing more bodies at the problem is not solving it. We are short of SE's and SE management. We have way too many co-primes units and need to dissolve the service cloud co-prime role. GB and Select comp plan is not aligned to a ""monthly cadence"" and only can make , few people are achieving quota and management is terrible. Management constantly complaining to reps about activity, expense reports or closed business. Monthly cadence for sales isn't aligned to the comp plan for GB and Select roles. A lot of politics. Limited Work Life Balance and Always on Call - We are not doctors or solving the world's most important problems. We are sales reps for a tech company. We should not be on call every night, weekend and on PTO. Reps are NOT encourage to take time away to re-energized and refocus. When reps try to take time off, they are getting daily emails from management. Managers Get Unlimited PTO / Reps Get Very Limited PTO - Managers not get unlimited PTO due to a policy change in April 2017 where Director level and above (management) get unlimited PTO, Meanwhile AE reps are limited to about 2 weeks of PTO and still filling out weekly time sheets! Everyone should be on the same policy - unlimited PTO. Credit on Deals - Another example of the politics and toxic culture is having another AE get credit and commission credit for a large deal they did not do any work on. This impacts the moral, work environment, and obviously commission. Management often overlooks doing the right thing and being inflexible."
5211,3.0,"Diversity Being a white male is a much better chance of moving up and certainly moving up at a more rapid pace or getting to any VP+ role. The ranks of non caucasians across the board in senior roles is small and you can see that the diversity racial numbers are largely inflated by lower level employees. Certainly there has been strides in recent years for diversity and upward mobility for women but by and large this is just white women. Ultimately the saddest part to it is that while Salesforce hired a non white person to lead diversity, his role has largely been symbolic and for external macro political reasons. As tangible cases of diversity issues have arisen on an individual employee basis, invariably it has been the side of the tenured white Salesforce leader who has won the day. Being an employee of color is frustrating at Salesforce because over time things do become patronizing as you are told if you do A, B or C you will increase your chances of getting a reward or a promotion. Yet clearly others do none of the above and those same rewards come their way. Writing this may sound like sour grapes but ultimately the numbers don't lie with employee diversity numbers across the board in middle to senior roles as well as tenure to promotion ratios for whites vs. non whites. Salesforce is not alone in tech let alone the wider corporate culture with this issue. However it is a company that prides itself on being progressive here and it really is not when it comes to employees within the company. Diversity is not a PR headline as we so often seek, it is actually people's lives."

I shouldn't be embarrassed to show my cluttered configuration. Compensation appears to be getter lower and lower around me - only a few appear to be making great money, the rest end up either just ok, but more frequently I'm hearing that other AE's have to take on debt in their so called ""Dreamjob"".

5224,2.0,"I started out as a Technical Solutions Architect. 3 years into my career I ended up under a particular manager that, according to multiple sources, was not a great manager. I've told my story unbiased to several other managers and co-workers, and they ALL agree that I was really given a raw deal. I was never given any solid opportunities to sharpen my Marketing Cloud skill-set, and the opportunities I was given (working on Accelerators) I excelled at. Every feedback received from customers (via Accelerators) and co-workers alike was nothing less than extraordinary. However, none of this mattered for some reason. I've kept a document that noted every piece of feedback received just in case I had to have something to back my story up with. I feel, along with others, that my manager had a personal vendetta against me and was working to get me dismissed. I was never given opportunities to work on real Marketing Cloud projects therefore, couldn't really get some good feedback going from that perspective. I was given the bare minimum to work with and often, I was left without work to do. In the end, I got tired of this treatment and began looking for other opportunities that really valued what I brought to the table. If you don't have a great manager, then there's no opportunity for advancement. No real skill set sharpening opportunities either. Get a good manager."

5235,3.0,"Salesforce is surprisingly political, especially when you consider how the brand is fun and there's a genuine ""do good"" ethos of philanthropy at the company. Salesforce attracts high performers, which is great in many ways but also leads to a very ""type A"" aggressive, win-at-all-cost environment. Add on top of that the fact that Marc likes to make multiple bets and encourage internal competition (it's why there are two customer service products that sometimes directly compete, two salesforce automation products, etc.). So you end up with a workplace culture that, while exceedingly positive and gracious on the surface, is actually quite cut-throat and reliant on personal connections over merit. I saw multiple examples of mid-level managers making decisions based on what would most impress the boss over what was best for the company, let alone the customer. There's an obsession with BSOs (Big Shiny Objects) that cost a fortune and have little impact on the business but can be touted internally in presentations to leadership."

5258,2.0,"Unfortunately there are a lot more Cons then there are Pros, which is a reflection of the location I was at: 1. The Management in Technical Support could use some Management training. Call Center management is well known for creating drama, poor morale, and inconsistency within the workplace. 2. The Managers create a toxic environment by not caring about employee welfare and falsifying information to employees. The company prides itself in transparency, but it doesn't seem that, that is the case. 3. If your not based in the headquarters office, it is extremely difficult to move into a new position, especially when your Managers has little to no interest in helping you grow professionally. 4. Employees are not held to the same standard as their peers. If your Manager likes you, you can get away with whatever you want. If he/she doesn't like you, you should plan on finding a new job as they will lie to upper management. 5. Upon starting a position with Salesforce, do not expect training because you're not going to get it. They would rather have you slave away fixing their previous mistakes, rather than properly train you to be efficient and knowledgeable about the product. The ramping up process is an absolute joke and an insult! 6. There is not one Manager who can do your job. None of the Manager's know the Salesforce platform or have any technical aptitude. 7. It is easy to get burnt out. For example 10 of the 12 months of my employment has consisted of 50 hour work weeks, full of insane workloads and the pressure to maintain specific metrics. They will squeeze every last bit of sanity and work out of you and all you get in return is the Managers cooking breakfast for you, which is an insult. Not only can they not manage, but they're also terrible cooks as well. 8. There is a lot of self-serving people in Technical Support and on Account Management teams. Rather than being one united team, people only look out for themselves and will quickly step on your toes if it suits them. 9. Your peers may appear to be on your side and want to make positive change with you. But they will be quick to stab you in the back if it means they will get in trouble.. Major lack of ""testinal fortitude"". 10.The morale in the office is equivalent to a prison. 11. As a Manager you should leave personal opinions and judgments at the door. 12. You can be extremely lazy, but have a good attitude and you will be treated like a top tier employee. If your a top performer but have the occasional bad day due to the high work volume and terrible workplace environment, your career will not flourish. 13. Managers are never available. And when they are, if you have questions or concerns, it is a huge convenience for them. 14. The platform UI is straight out of 2005. Who uses i-Frames anymore? 15. There's a lack of tools and resources available to do our jobs and Management will tell you the resources are coming, but they never do. Of if you do get them, it is too little, too late. 16. The company has lost its vision.. Being innovative doesn't involve buying other platforms/software and integrating it into your own. It is creating the product on your own."

5273,4.0,Need more diversity and people of color in management positions
5274,3.0,Salesforce tends to acquire with little emphasis on actually integrating behind the scenes outside of the products - something exacerbated by them acquiring Demandware when the dust of Demandware acquiring Tomax hadn't yet settled. The Salt Lake City office has a very different vibe than other Demandware or Salesforce locations. There are some passive aggressive personalities in it due to some painfully obvious coddling by prior (and some present) management. Many hold job titles that are not at parity with industry guidelines and somehow think that they are 'special' when they wouldn't survive a month in that role elsewhere. People tend to withhold information whether it's dodging questions they know the answers to or refusing to document things because they view themselves as more valuable with secrets locked in their heads. For the technical professional who wants to come in and get things accomplished the SLC office culture will wear on you. It is the opposite of collaborative except for a few key people working hard to change the dynamic.

5285,3.0,"New AEs or people considering coming to dot org – there is a caveat and buyer beware! It’s starting to feel like a sink-or-swim culture with so many new people coming onboard. I’ve been asked to work with numerous new AEs as they stepped into their role since fall/December of 2018. It’s become very clear that we are not taking the right steps to onboard them. New AEs are overwhelmed with the boundless options and tools we give them. Not to mention, for December hires, their RVPs were busy closing FY ’19 business, so our most vulnerable new hires were left to fend for themselves. Hopefully, they’ll get RVP support once FY ’20 kicks off. Bottom line: our intentions are good, but our execution fails them. It’s interesting that we constantly, almost self-righteously, talk about “the pace of Salesforce” as if it’s a badge of honor that only a few can achieve. Most new AEs coming into higher ed want to achieve and catch onto this pace right away. However, unfortunately we’re sabotaging their success by everything we throw at them (and again, often without RVP support). The enablement and RVP teams need to do better jobs of sequencing and blocking off the new hire content. Instead, we are throwing everything plus the kitchen sink at them – all at once – and expecting them to make sense of it all. No wonder I get panic-stricken phone calls and text messages at all hours of the day/night from rookies. Many RVPs are telling down their throats for answers, yet we haven’t paced their learning. In our current state of onboarding, I don’t know if even I could make it through this process given the “throw-it-all-at-them” approach we now take."

5290,2.0,"A few months ago, there was a large surge of hiring. Most of the hires came from a third party vendor that was closing. Some of the new hires from this location were previously denied applicants. I discovered that these new employees were being hired in Senior positions over me, making more money than me, and were even given relocation bonuses that I was told I could not have when I relocated in the previous year to work for this company. When I was first hired, the interview process seemed incredibly difficult to get through. Once they had seats to fill, it became a mad dash to find anyone with any Salesforce experience to fill the seats, and they seemed to do anything to get those people here. I am now left feeling worthless and insignificant in my surroundings. My experience, hard work, and dedication to this company is now meshed into a field of call center employees dashing to meet metrics. On top of the new employees that were hired from this vendor, they also hired managers. I know that people take time to adjust, but these managers are killing our vibe. Salesforce prides itself on transparency. These managers keep secrets and treat employees like worker bees. We have had multiple interactions with upper management where they will talk about a big change, and act surprised when they find out that those of us at the bottom didn't know about the change. The new managers don't understand the need for work and life balance. We previously had options to work remotely when we were ill, or even having an off day. Where we were didn't matter as long as we were doing our jobs. Now, if you are sick and want to work from home, you are asked to take PTO (since you are not given Sick time, you need to use your vacation time)more often, which encourages sick people to come to work and spread their illness throughout the building. Talent seems to mean nothing here as well. It's all about how many years of service. I know of employees who don't put in the effort , who barely get their work done, and they are promoted because of how long they've been here, while I train other employees, mentor, and do still meet metrics, and I'm stuck at the same level. You report to a manager here, but good luck finding your manager if you need something. The Managers are presented as people managers, but when it really comes down to it, they are project managers. I end up doing many small tasks for my manager, that my manager doesn't have time to do, in order to keep my team running smoothly. By no means do I blame my manager for this, but they need to take some of this off their plates. They seem to work 24 hours a day. We recently had a huge push to get our case load down to a specific number. Our portion of the Organization spent 10 weeks squeezing every last drop out of every single one of us to close as many cases as possible. The communication that was sent out read as ""I know you are working hard and thank you for your efforts, but work harder"". After week 8, everyone around me was miserable. There were daily meltdowns from ""Analysts"" who were mad at customers for needing help, when the real problem was the amount of work they expected us to do, and the free time outside of work they expected us to sacrifice. Of course, management didn't see these meltdowns because they were off running Reports on metrics and trying to over analyze the reason behind xyz. When I first came here, I really thought that this was a career. It now feels now different than any call center or retail job I have worked in. This is the longest I've ever worked at a company without receiving a promotion."

The Lightning release was a shining moment for how the company's culture can facilitate great things. However, there have been a number of changes over the last year that have slowly eroded the magic - starting with some of the new leadership. Our group has become more fragmented and less collaborative. There's more fear of making mistakes and the general sense of trust and support for our work from our leadership has gone way down. The transparency and access we had upwards is becoming more hazy largely because of layers being added. My autonomy and empowerment to make decisions is slipping away. Politics were always there, but now they're something you have to consider daily. You used to be judged based on the work you created and what you shipped, it doesn't feel that way anymore. Some of my favorite people have already moved on. Perhaps it's just the nature of a company growing this fast. There's not a clear avenue for safely giving upwards feedback for our group. My hope is that someone up top takes notice and makes corrections."

5317,2.0,"Inept managers, toxic politics I worked with ""the creative group"" within the marketing organization. The creative team is full of creatives that are half asleep and just there for the check. The team structure - product vertices, aka ""clouds"", paying for your position as a creative/ Program Manager/ media etc, but not considering a part of their cloud per se is weird and causes a lot of issues. Middle management in this group is inept on a good day. I feel like I actually lost ground on skill development while here. Overall some of the worst politics I've ever encountered."
5318,5.0,Workload can be very high at times
5319,4.0,"Comp plans reward AE's, SE's not so much. High growth causes issues with quality of mid level management HQ/SF focus, remote employees seem to have a harder path to success Incredible title inflation, over thousand+ VPs Co-prime bus rolling into complex deals creates competing goals Need to proactively manage your career or you may get run over."
5320,5.0,"I could be greedy and ask for free food, but I'll settle with the free cafe and boujie coffee"
5321,2.0,"Management - Many Managers, Few Leaders - Moral is low. Few are making quota. Micro management is pervasive. Management wants to own all the deals and tell AE's what to do and how to do it. There is no trust in the AE's ability to drive a deal to close. Management attempts to drive rep behavior by fear and focusing too much on the volume of activity. There is a lack of focus on being out in territory vs volume of remote calls / meetings. Management needs to do a better job of using the app to reference next steps and activity. AE's are asked to repeat what is already in the app and often a waste of time and meetings. Quota Attainment and Resources - Very few people are hitting quota and throwing more bodies at the problem is not solving it. We are short of SE's and SE management. We have way too many co-primes units and need to dissolve the service cloud co-prime role. GB and Select comp plan is not aligned to a ""monthly cadence"" and only can make , few people are achieving quota and management is terrible. Management constantly complaining to reps about activity, expense reports or closed business. Monthly cadence for sales isn't aligned to the comp plan for GB and Select roles. A lot of politics. Limited Work Life Balance and Always on Call - We are not doctors or solving the world's most important problems. We are sales reps for a tech company. We should not be on call every night, weekend and on PTO. Reps are NOT encourage to take time away to re-energized and refocus. When reps try to take time off, they are getting daily emails from management. Managers Get Unlimited PTO / Reps Get Very Limited PTO - Managers not get unlimited PTO due to a policy change in April 2017 where Director level and above (management) get unlimited PTO, Meanwhile AE reps are limited to about 2 weeks of PTO and still filling out weekly time sheets! Everyone should be on the same policy - unlimited PTO. Credit on Deals - Another example of the politics and toxic culture is having another AE get credit and commission credit for a large deal they did not do any work on. This impacts the moral, work environment, and obviously commission. Management often overlooks doing the right thing and being inflexible."
5322,5.0,At times very fast paced environment
5323,5.0,"People revere Marc Benioff a little too much Strange Hawaiian theme (Salesforce ""Ohana"", cheesy company theme song) Huge focus on the sales department, which can sometimes have a culture clash with engineering"
5324,3.0,"Over engineering things at times, some teams and managers are terrible to work with. People in some teams do a lot of politics, and managers conceal problems and do not admit them. After the recent orgwide change to hybrid engineering, felt that some managers from the former QE background are extremely incompetent to manage a scrum team - particularly ones with developers that have been too long with one team. Rather than solving the problems with the team, and addressing concerns with team dynamics, managers are just political and focus on purely increasing velocity."
5325,5.0,"Work / Life can be tough, things seem to change for the sake of change"
5326,5.0,nothing that I can think of at the time.
5327,5.0,"As with any growth company, there are som immaturities - sometimes it feels as if we are making it up as we go, which can be good but can also pose challenges within a larger company the size of Salesforce. Also, there can be compensation challenges for some sales roles."
5328,3.0,The culture is becoming Oracle. The original salesforce culture is gone. Very political. Too much time spent managing perception and not enough serving the customer.
5329,5.0,sometimes job can be slow
5330,5.0,So far I have not found any
5331,5.0,"It's fast paced company, with 3 releases every year, but that is not really a con for some people including me."
5332,5.0,HUGE!! therefore slightly hard to gauge opportunities to move up..
5333,5.0,"High stress High intensity If you are a top performer today, be prepared to re-adjust your personal/professional standards. Your best will more than likely only put you mid-pack"
5334,4.0,Work/Life balance can be tough
5335,5.0,"It's hard to keep up with all of the new functionality released. Many new features in the product, released 3 times a year."
5336,4.0,There are not enough Indian restaurants available which is a shame considering majority of the employees are vegetarian.
5337,3.0,- lower level management is poor in regards to management skills - weak H.R department when it comes to representing employees concerns - a TON of politics to deal with
5338,5.0,"This is a big company with a human size. From my experience, there is no cons about working at Salesforce."
5339,5.0,Extremely fast paced and high pressure.
5340,5.0,"Adherence to G Suite for office software is annoying, and big company meeting culture inhibits ability to get important work done."
5341,5.0,"Depending on your position, there can be a lot of mandatory training/certifications and not all of them are actually applicable to your everyday job. This isn't a big con, more of a minor annoyance that we all learn to live with."
5342,4.0,Little work life balance. FY18 objectives have grown exponentially without commensurate support.
5343,4.0,"Within marketing cloud, product and support structure suffered owing to several acquisitions that put client facing people in a lot of very challenging spots without good answers. Tough career mobility outside of SF office."
5344,4.0,A bit challenging for remote Employees
5345,4.0,"Lots of politics (both internal and, of course, external) almost all of which revolve around left-wing ideologies. Sometimes, support from supervisors can be hit or miss. Easy to get into a rut where monotony kicks in. Sometimes advancement opportunities can be lost because managers don't actually want to promote from within."
5346,5.0,"The only con is the fast pace of the environment... not necessarily a con, but it is easy to fall behind if you don't prioritize your time."
5347,4.0,"Promotion paths and skills at certain titles vary drastically between teams, as do expectations"
5348,1.0,Quality of people declining Quality of culture declining
5349,5.0,"Can not think of any tons really. Based in San Francisco, so commute will be bad if you are traveling from s bay"
5350,1.0,"This was the worst job I've ever had. Management talks down to you like I haven't been doing this for 10 years (and my boss has less experience with half the success).... And I was #1 on my team and #11 in the country. They claim compensation is great but when based in Atlanta you get the most bottom of the barrel accounts and this means everything (you have to deal with it). I've never worked so hard for a $2K deal... in. my. life. In my previous life, I never glimpsed at anything under $100K. That was for newer reps. If you sell a $100K deal, you will be at the top for the month and everyone freaks out. So what this means.... what they say you will get paid is a FAR stretch from reality. I was above my number and didn't make what they claimed because when I got my sales compensation package there are all these other factors. Therefore, I made SIGNIFICANTLY less here than my last job. The base was higher but that was it. I'm a hunter and have always been one. Here, it does NOT make sense to focus on hunting because you get new accounts every year and for a prospect to switch CRM's this decision isn't made overnight. Don't let the recruiter tell you otherwise. Trust me. Every current client that I did get, I had to do damage control from previous reps trying to squeeze every dollar out of them. The previous sales reps had their own agenda and it really hurt our clients. Because you get new accounts each year, the previous reps didn't care about the future. They did whatever it took to get $ and then dumped the client. I spent the first 6 months trying to get our clients not to leave us. The office is LOUD because the desk are on top of each other with no sound barriers and all the conference rooms are booked. Clients made many comments about the background noise and it's embarrassing."
5351,5.0,You can often struggle with your work/life balance based on the YoY high-growth demands.
5352,5.0,Kind of obsolete build tools
5353,5.0,Orgs within the company work in silos. Growng pains as the company rapidly expands
5354,5.0,I haven't really experienced any cons so far.
5355,5.0,"a bit of an overwhelming pace, but well worth it!"
5356,4.0,"Its very easy to get stuck- company is growing much too fast and your own individual team is really ran like its own company, which is not always a positive. Extremely political- buckle up if thats not what your used to. Very hard to get in, and even harder to move around once you're here."
5357,5.0,"-long ramp time, 6-8 months"
5358,5.0,Need to look at alternate cities that aren't so expensive as San Francisco
5359,5.0,Sometimes managers do not appropriately recognize and reward for the work you do.
5360,5.0,#1 advice- get used to change!
5361,5.0,Quickly growing company. Hope it maintains that entrepreneurial spirit.
5362,5.0,Growing a very rapid pace that may result in a loss of culture. The perks do not compare to other large tech companies in the area.
5363,5.0,Really can't think of any cons.
5364,5.0,None at the moment. Please hire more guys like me!
5365,5.0,Peaceful atmosphere and the numbers are great too.
5366,5.0,"Large company, red tape, too many systems and apps"
5367,4.0,"Paths to promotions can be a bit of a ""grey area,"" in which politics seems to play a large part. Fast-paced environment means that there can be an overwhelming number of firedrills. High-up decisions sometimes seem to be made on a whim."
5368,5.0,Less of a Con and more of a challenge to be aware of: You will have lots to learn--even if you previously worked in the Salesforce ecosystem!
5369,5.0,"Not many cons to be had, some may find the volume of work to be difficult to handle though. Work pace is fast and sometimes chaotic."
5370,3.0,"In my career at Salesforce, I saw many individual contributors promoted into people manager. While it's great for career development, unfortunately, in most cases these managers are unprepared to manage other employees. Taking manager training is not enough. Inexperienced managers become abusive and micromanager. They don't know how to treat their employees. Unfortunately, management allows this as long as work gets done."
5371,1.0,Too much annoying bureaucracy. Your tenure at the company dictates how valuable your ideas are instead of its merit. Huge technical debt and age old technical stack. Code takes few hours to compile and is terrible. Most of the developers are fresh grads or been with the company for an extensive period of time. Engineering executives are non-technical but have been with the company for a long time. Lot of QA folks have been promoted to Director and Sr. Directors as they did a good job buttering up the executives. Too much title inflation in Product and Engineering. Hectic work life balance in San Francisco HQ. Change in Direction of the Product and Reorgs happen almost every few weeks. Mediocre developers keep on changing groups in the Open Opportunity Market and still survive.
5372,3.0,Have nothing against the company
5373,5.0,You can often struggle with your work/life balance based on the YoY high-growth demands.
5374,5.0,The only Con was I couldn't stay on longer.
5375,5.0,"Definitely some politics going on, but if you can find a good manager, you'll be protected"
5376,3.0,"Lots of posturing, no trust and micro management. If you are not in the office they think you're not working even though the position is customer facing sales. They hire young and the arrogant and if you happen to be older (35+ ) you will not fit in especially if you have a family."
5377,1.0,Makes excuses and has autocratic style
5378,3.0,- Solution Engineering turning into Nepotism based growth path - First time in my career here I felt I am back to the starting line - Al(most) ex-CBU members favored for promotions and next level positions - No career coaching/path programs. Cannot do everything using Trailhead
5379,5.0,typical....really cool company gets really big and loses a little bit of its edge.
5380,5.0,None To Report Right Now
5381,4.0,"Office location culture does not match HQ culture, which is a big deal since that is the main reason for joining. Issue is around team co-operation and trust in people."
5382,5.0,The company's big and it's hard to know everything that's happening.
5383,4.0,Culture can be a little over the top
5384,5.0,Can't think of anything to saw
5385,5.0,Internal politics but much less than most companies.
5386,5.0,Some old technology. Salesforce is a successful business running on an 18 year old application.
5387,5.0,not much to complain about
5388,5.0,Fast pace in a fast growing organization will challenge you in a good way so be willing to bring your A game to the job!
5389,5.0,"Big and sometimes confusing who has the right knowledge, Extensive on-boarding can feel like drinking from a firehose"
5390,5.0,"Competitive, need to make a brand for yourself since the org is so large"
5391,5.0,Required to do trailheads every other week it seems like.
5392,3.0,"Only Product jobs are in Indy. Comp is only great if you live in the Midwest, if you're hired to work in a remote office be prepared to work with clients of similar skills sets that will make a lot more than you. Benefits are not equal per locale, some offices get parking, food, gyms, subway passes, etc. Simply because that's the bare min to acquire people in that locale, too bad for you if you don't live there. PTO is really poor compared to our parent company SalesForce Benefits are not up to par with our parent company SalesForce, try to find ET benefits and then find SF benefits. You'll notice ET's benefits are impossible to find and SF brags about theirs. That should be your sign. If you're assigned to SOW in Services or Support, there is little to no incentive to move you into something challenging. Most changes are done because of attrition as the organization are pretty flat outside of product. Salary bands don't exist, or if they do they are very lax. It's common someone on your team negotiated really hard and someone just took a college entry job. HR still doesn't have a classification for all skill sets in the field. SaaS margins puts a huge amount of pressure within Support/Services orgs, teams are currently being forced to find ways to offshore aspect of their work to India."
5393,5.0,"Transitioning from a startup to an established enterprise corporation and learning new processes that used to work but don't, now that we have scaled and grown."
5394,3.0,"Fast growth has led to certain challenges, specifically in terms of onboarding and complexity. It also feels like we're an afterthought to Salesforce. We're starting to get some of their benefits, but salary and especially bonus discrepancies continue to be the norm according to Glassdoor reports."
5395,4.0,"Lot of changes, politics in technology, expect more than usual from employees, if you have a large commute and kids to handle then you will suffer and feel hard to do *everything well, stocks will handcuff you so beware and move on if you are saturating"
5396,5.0,* Technology decisions made high up in management.
5397,1.0,"Base pay will be lower than their competitors. You'll be expected to work long hours, a lot of overtime and practically live there at the end of each month and quarter. Hard to obtain quotas, but you'll get no sympathy if you speak up or ask for support. It's a machine...a hard-core, cold-calling environment. Your phone WONT ring just because they're ""Salesforce"", despite what they'll feed you in your interview. If you're headed there...prepare for the stress and long nights!"
5398,5.0,None in my opinion. Salesforce is a great company and good people overall.
5399,5.0,"Growing pains as a result of fast growth but given the rate of growth, the organization recognizes this"
5400,5.0,Sometimes feels like loosely organized chaos
5401,2.0,"Management glaringly incomplete / arrogant! the wave analytics product should of never been released...at least another 18 months of basic development needed... Couldn't do basic analytics functions, nowhere on the Gartner Magic quadrant, and dropped price so much that reps can't make any money unless it's an added line item on a large non Wave deal"
5402,5.0,Can't think of anything to saw
5403,5.0,Only complaint is that it can get political sometimes - all about the brand
5404,5.0,undefined measures for promotions - can be less of a meritocracy in some departments.
5405,5.0,Meetings and distractions that come working for a huge corporation.
5406,4.0,"Little room for advancement in some of the sub-clouds, unless you worked at whatever company got acquired to create that cloud. Can be hard to move up or onto different teams of your own volition. Constant reorganizations of mid-level management make it hard to get established as a newer employee."
5407,5.0,"Entrepreneurial, ie., Lots of do-it-yourself administrative work with little administrative assistance."
5408,5.0,Nothing to report here.
5409,5.0,No cons at this time
5410,5.0,"- Parts of Salesforce is still old, so it may be hard to work in those areas. - Company changes constantly so if you want to succeed, you must adapt"
5411,5.0,It's an awesome place to work at. No Cons at the moment.
5412,4.0,Highly competitive to grow in the company. Most growth opportunities are in Sales and Technology.
5413,5.0,They could put more thought into how they determine individual quotas.
5414,5.0,Easy to get lost if you don't pay attention!
5415,4.0,"company has become too large. With so many people is hard to propagate a culture of trust, transparency and collaboration within all departments and teams"
5416,3.0,- Promoting killer salespeople to management doesn't breed the best leadership culture - Expecting massive growth YoY is a grind
5417,5.0,"Like any other large company, there are reorgs (probably 1-2x/year), but I haven't felt the negative effects of those so far"
5418,5.0,"I can't think of any, though cons could be perceived if you aren't comfortable with an extremely fast paced publicly traded organization. That's not an organizational fault, but solely a byproduct of how fast Salesforce is innovating to continue leading the industry and serving our clients."
5419,5.0,Churn rate in staff in some areas
5420,5.0,Constant Changes in Management
5421,5.0,"In such a big company, paper works sometimes could take longer than you think."
5422,4.0,"-Some engineers who are at and above principal/architect levels have antiquated skill sets and (strongly) tend to stick to the old ways of doing things, which can clog the fresh ideas. When a word comes from the people with these job titles, it can carry more weight, and sway the product decisions toward old ways keeping the company from trying out new things"
5423,4.0,Communication could be improved for certain areas.
5424,3.0,"Some teams are very underresourced which is very challenging when you are supporting a huge and growing sales organization, which is (not surprisingly) the engine of the company. If you aren't front and center in sales, don't expect a lot of support from the organizatoin."
5425,1.0,"I was sexually harassed by my direct manager (who later tried to have me written up for inappropriate conduct). I was repeatedly harassed by my next manager for years. He would belittle me and chastise me, call me out for doing something wrong even though I was the top seller. HR did nothing when I came to them, the head of the department said I ""stressed him out"" to hear about these problems."
5426,5.0,Salesforce is a large company and can sometimes get lost in the politics
5427,4.0,Lots of changes all the time and directional pivots. What you get hired for maybe a completely different job in a few months.
5428,5.0,wish they extend more contracts. Now they have two years.
5429,5.0,Still in my first year so there's not much I haven't found to be very satisfied with. As we grow and the industry consolidates my one concern is over extending on acquisitions that may negatively impact culture or cost more than necessary. Keep them strategic for our vision.
5430,1.0,Parking is scarce difficult and expensive
5431,5.0,"At the time, the company was still a bit disorganized, especially the Enterprise Business Unit."
5432,5.0,"like any place, there are politics, but management is good at recognizing real contributions * I like to work, so don't mind putting in extra time to get work done. Some may look at this as a con"
5433,5.0,"Growing fast, difficult to keep pace with offerings and all associated products."
5434,5.0,Being a contractor in a department without growth
5435,4.0,They continually change direction on customer success before completely seeing the historical results with programs.
5436,4.0,Work/life balance isn't always there and it's inconsistent depending on the team you're on Some teams are more hierarchical than others Is becoming a bigger company
5437,5.0,"* like any place, there are politics, but management is good at recognizing real contributions * I like to work, so don't mind putting in extra time to get work done. Some may look at this as a con"
5438,5.0,The company has grown tremendously in past few years. Sometimes it feels like a massive company in terms of the number of the people.
5439,5.0,"You can get lost, growing so fast that management is bringing on their crownies"
5440,4.0,Promotions are not based on delivery rather who know who.
5441,5.0,It can be a bit of a grind.
5442,5.0,"could not find any , Great place to work."
5443,5.0,Not the place to go if you don't like change
5444,4.0,Lack of HR functionality and very hard to advance the career
5445,4.0,"Growing, company needs starting to overshadow employee needs. Also, the territories for Account Executives are extremely small and competitive, most Account Executives don't make quota. Hit or miss. Not very good training."
5446,4.0,Pushing product add-ons to customer that they can’t adopt
5447,5.0,"Fast-paced, very innovative. Great environment for someone who can think on their feet but not if you are not adaptive to change."
5448,4.0,"It's a very fast-paced culture requiring high-commitment. At times, work-life balance suffers."
5449,5.0,"Other than the fact that they don't see virtual work with keen eyes (weird for a cloud company), I loved this work."
5450,5.0,The hours were long and tiring. People expect you to work more than your assigned hours.
5451,2.0,Salesforce is now a well-oiled machine. Rules of engagement make it nearly impossible to do your job and most territories/patches have been saturated. They are also now putting more AE's in territory.
5452,5.0,If you are looking for a 9-5 job - salesforce is not the employer for you
5453,3.0,"In Indianapolis, the company treats contractors as second class citizens. They cram them into over crowded rooms with little space to work. The rooms are hot and uncomfortable making it hard to work. Add in the personal hygiene of some workers and you get the idea. Exclusion from company events and support is the norm."
5454,5.0,"Like I said depending who your team and what building is, you will either enjoy it or not."
5455,5.0,The free snacks can challenge weight management.
5456,5.0,Too big a company to make some real change or big impact
5457,4.0,"While the culture is great, there is a burn out factor...most likely because of tough patches, still large company with growing pains. Opportunities exist within for sure but limited in some aspects. Must be in office (if not in Enterprise), especially if you want to move into management role."
5458,4.0,Stressful work environment Always tensed colleagues
5459,5.0,"An unbelievable amount of information to learn before truly becoming effective, not really a ""con"", simply a fact of life."
5460,3.0,"As a women working alongside Alpha sales males, I have come across more men at Salesforce than any other company in my work history, who think it's okay to be condensing and not respectful. There are different ways to manage men and women, and some of the sales leaders at SF don't have an understanding of the basic respect and cross collaboration it takes to be a good leader to a female."
5461,5.0,This is not a 40 hour a week job. We work hard and play hard.
5462,5.0,I don't really have any cons at the moment
5463,5.0,It is an established company that has slowed down in the speed you can progress through the company. This has made it harder to get recognized and stand out amongst peers.
5464,5.0,"Higher up management seem to be missing the reality of what occurs, but the managers do bring this to them at times."
5465,5.0,Some of the tools used are outdated
5466,5.0,Typical Politics that come with the corporate
5467,5.0,Work hours - long & stressful
5468,4.0,"A natural impact of the company growth is that there starts to be a ""big company"" feel when it comes to metrics and performance."
5469,4.0,"It's good, no issues, I would recommend the company to anyone. Trying to get to the 20 word minimum, don't know what else to say"
5470,5.0,Long stressful hours/days seem to happen weeks or months at a time.
5471,5.0,"Nothing really! Location (DT Palo Alto) is kind of a pain, since interns can't get parking permits."
5472,4.0,"Some disconnect between senior management and the workers (like every company). Lack of integration between products makes product development frustrating because we constantly fight fires while trying to improve the product. One or the other has to give all the time. Every employee event feels a little weird with Hawaiian music, Buddhist prayers and cartoon mascots. The outside reputation of Salesforce being a cult are far overstated, but it does feel like the culture overall is a bit hodgepodge and unfocused. While promotions are frequent, it's a very flat organization, so there isn't a ton of room for upward mobility. Most people just get a ""Senior"" or ""Director"" slapped to their title, and then if you want more, it's either lateral or out. The problem is that lateral moves are kind of limited without learning an entirely new job function."
5473,3.0,"Most Engineers are much older -- not much of a youth culture. The work is also extremely boring, as you are not solving any really interesting problems."
5474,5.0,Very large company. It's easy to get lost in the crowd. A lot more policies and procedures than we have had in the past.
5475,5.0,"As Salesforce becomes a larger company it becomes more difficult to maintain a ""start up"" culture. Everyone is committed to making Salesforce a great place to work and as a result I don't see this as a big issue."
5476,5.0,Salesforce pace and speed is not for everyone. You have to bring your A++ every day and a stumble while permitted can be cut throat the higher up the food chain you go.
5477,3.0,"New AE product enablement is embarrassingly bad. The first 12 months are sink or swim, and aside from self-enabling yourself, the territories are hit or miss. Sales reps that have crushed their quota at other companies often struggle due to poor territory carves and slow enablement ramp time. Furthermore, Marketing Cloud basically acts as its own company within Salesforce. Collaboration with the CRM business is weak at best, and Marketing Cloud's biggest competitor has been its own internal solution, Pardot. Last, sales managers here are mostly just that, managers. True leaders in management are few and far between. For example, struggling AEs are mostly on their own to figure it out, which is resulting in higher AE turnover."
5478,4.0,Too many products and admin issues taking away from selling time. Annual re-org fraught with issues that takes months to iron out.
5479,5.0,"While the account coverage is manageable, the needs of every customer differs dramatically. This is a positive, in that you are not doing the same thing for every customer every day. However, it does require that you have tremendous breath to provide guidance, best practices and practical advise in many solution areas."
5480,5.0,"Things move fast, it can be hard to keep up. The first few weeks have been a real challenge"
5481,5.0,"The tech stack is getting pretty old at this point. Don't plan on advancing your knowledge in new languages and platforms if you're working on core. Front end folks have our new UI platform to work with, but it has a load of sharp edges. There's a lot of indoctrination and cultural training, but it generally has the end goal of getting people to be good to each other and to work together well."
5482,4.0,"Pace of growth and quotas getting more difficult to support. Rapidly maturing product suite,"
5483,4.0,"Stale systems, low stock compensation, finance role can be slow moving and lacking in innovation. Interview process is often rushed"

5487,4.0,Stingy about giving RSU. There is no incentive for folks to stay in Salesforce if their compensation is falling behind.
5488,3.0,"Zero Growth. No Internal Opportunities. Out of 10 roles one applies internally, you get selected for none. If you are lucky to get an interview - the scrutiny is so severe that you wonder - what did I do in Salesforce for so many years that one needs to still prove their worth!"

5534,4.0,"- Work-life balance is missing, especially now during covid, you will work long days and sometimes also in weekends. Work never ends. - Very performance driven, always high pressure to sell more, a lot of forecasting and at times micro-management. - Management is lacking coaching/people/leadership skills, you are heavily managed on opportunities and numbers, but very little on personal improvement. - Politics are present, as well as ego-centrism within sales & mngmnt. - Achieving your target depends on the distribution of accounts and opportunities, which changes every year. - Very complex internal organisation that can come across as impersonal at times. eg no HR and if you have questions you can only log tickets."

5537,5.0,"- Sometimes unrealistic sales / business management expectations from product resulting in oversells, it's a solid product but there's a lot of work needed to get to a setup that will do well on the enterprise scale. Smaller setups can work but if you are looking for the big benefits it requires time investment. - The 'family feel' push internally. This is really nice when you are newly immersed in it but you also need to be wary of assuming it's like a perfect family. Families have fights, internal squabbles and sometimes break apart so always look after your own future don't expect that completely from the company. - Steep learning curve if you've never worked on Salesforce product(s) before but there is lots of help there. Still a great place to work and earn professional experience or build your career. Genuinely love the company and everything they've done for me to date."

5566,4.0,"Targets are very high and in most roles you're working on a saturated market. Prospecting is very difficult as you sometimes only have 3-10 accounts to work with in total, but the target seems to be created from a growth mindset where every account is going through a full digital transformation. Base salaries are relatively low (compared with similar organisations), so if you're not blessed with a great patch, you are going through tough times. The organisation is focused on selling, selling, selling, and less so on pre-sales engineer support or customer success once the deal is sold."

5584,4.0,too many useless meetings - company grew too big
5585,4.0,"EGOS. From what I experienced, most people work here because they want to be able to tell other people that they work here. Ultimately giving them an ego boost. I felt like I was living in a simulation. An ornament. Most of the people at SFDC are smart, but brainwashed, and not smart enough to realise. Lots of people doing jobs that aren't necessary, and it's kind of sad and depressing because they think they're actually doing something meaningful and contributing to something, when in reality they're really not, and just ticking a manager's box. Also, tall poppy syndrome is still rife in certain teams in the Melbourne office especially, and is why your top talent resigns and your egos are so big that it takes you over a year to accept it........................................................."

5594,1.0,"This review is for recruiters hyd team. There were so many worst experiences with them. Trust and Transparency is the great qualities of the Salesforce. But it seems the recruiters don't care at all. Even though referred so many people, Not sure what's the problem, They never got the call for interview. Also, another experience with them, Some of the recruiters at least don't response to the pings when we ping to them for information, Even after pinging so many times. If they don't respond at least to the internal employees, not sure how they interact with the interview candidates. This is very disappointing how they treat internal employees and at least they should respond. I understand ping people are busy some days or times. But not 2/7 or week. Honestly the recruiter experience is worst experience, They don't care at all. They don't respect time and they don't respect individuals and don't reply to at least internal employees. Also I had heard so many that, Even after candidates performed well, Finally the result is the candidates were rejected."

5617,4.0,Can feel very much like a cult sometimes and promotion is political
5618,3.0,You can be the hero one month and the other month definitely not. Also you need to be very lucky with your industry. Big differences in bonuses if you have a bad industry compared to somebody else.

5623,3.0,The way they manage people in Marketing Cloud is a toxic legacy from the Exact Target days. Bullying and threats are common place.
5624,5.0,"I personally don't have any cons. Leadership has an open door policy and questions are answered timely and appropriately. I do concur with the other reviews that there are a lot of projects and they're fast paced. You have to pay attention to details and be proactive in your planning and approach to delivering your requirements to stay on track. It's big league work in a fast, fun, and family-like setting."

5629,5.0,Difficult to reach the target in sale depts
5630,5.0,- You really have to want it to keep up with all the content
5631,2.0,"Apart from the mentioned executives you have a lot of execs fighting to build their empires. Some are good but those below are doing anything to be noticed. Salesforce used to have a great culture but lost this a long time ago due to hiring talent from slow beurocratic red tape enterprises such as Oracle. They used to say they dont want to be the next Oracle but that is exactly where they have gone. Leadership within the support organization specifically is appalling, no vision, no care for employees and very blame oriented. No accountability from global support execs all they care about is ensuring if something goes wrong they can shift blame. This has resulted in a toxic environtment. That along with most new support roles being only hired in their India offices is leading to a poor experience from employees elsewhere and customers are suffering for it also with unhappy employees. This is not to say there are not some great departments but support is certainly not one of them, stay out of the support organization."
5632,5.0,Nothing that I can think of.
5633,5.0,No cons found to be good
5634,5.0,Lots of products to learn
5635,3.0,"- Anyone not in a direct quota carrying roles is treated as a second-class citizen, and the sales side of the business (e.g. account executives and sales leadership) is revered and constantly lauded on internal calls. - Obsessive fixation on hitting quotas and revenue targets, which drives a culture of upselling (even when the customer doesn't really need it—despite their ""Customer Success"" value). - It is difficult to relate the SE pay and bonus to company performance—despite ever-growing revenues and beating last year's results, this never really translates into a significant increase in pay/bonus. - Murky promotion and career progression process that gets called out every year in the employee survey, but nothing really gets done about it. Hiring budget seems to be spent on bringing in more AEs (the quality of which varies considerably). - The open, sharing culture has led to oversharing, and useful information and documents are scattered across a load of different sources (Google Drive, Quip, Slack, various Salesforce orgs)—with no single way of searching across all of these. - Lots of internal ""noise"", which can distract from the day job (webinars, endless all-hands calls, irritating Slack channels etc). - Internal culture can feel a bit cultish at times and there is a growing disconnect between the US and non-US workforce. You have to drink the Kool-Aid to get ahead. - The internal Salesforce org (Org62) is a mess making it very difficult to navigate, Lots of duplicate data (e.g. accounts and contacts) across the organisation, which leads to internal fighting over territories/customers. - The company swings between big corporate and scrappy startup: some internal processes are excessively bureaucratic and long-winded (e.g. requiring manager approval for a $5 software purchase), and elsewhere decisions are taken on a whim. - Some employees can feel ostracised if they don't submit to the (exceedingly) left-leaning, social justice obsessed political views of the organisation. - A globally distributed workforce means that emails and Slack messages come in at all hours of the day—depending on the team, internal meetings can start early or run late into the evening."
5636,3.0,"Politics, promotions, not competitive pay, limited paths forward"
5637,5.0,Work pressure which almost bearable
5638,4.0,"The amount of training to be completed alongside your job is overwhelming, it's good , but constant and can be difficult to prioritize your job at times with the deadlines. The resources are great, but they reference other resources to other resources, it's difficult to find quick answers to things at times as you will get stuck in a rabbit hole of content. Accounts / Territories can be saturated, lot's of whitespace for AMs. So you have to be good at finding new business to be successful. There are too many measures and KPI's. Every week there is a new KPI to try ad hit. Processes to move into new roles / hiring situations take a lot of time."
5639,4.0,Shrinking territories to sell into

5642,4.0,Prioritization can sometimes be difficult with lots going on
5643,5.0,"Sales is sales and with a resetting quota at the end of every month, you have to be prepared to reset at $0 and do it all over again. Even though we get 19 Days off in the first year, it's hard to take time off because the less you work, the less you make. Company is growing from a startup to a major corporation - that growth means there are a lot of things that are changing and you hear about the ""good old days"" a lot - as if you missed out on how things used to be (not pre pandemic, I mean like 10 years ago) and things have changed a lot."

5680,2.0,"Poor management with no sense of leadership, have to manage up and be highly political which is tough due to the lack of trust and accountability. Most managers don't have an interest in developing, coaching or helping their team. They are paid on the performance of a territories growth and not individual success so as long as they are hitting YOY targets, which means they aren't concerned about individual success. Success is heavily dependent on the territory and winning the ""Salesforce lottery."" People seem friendly but are very exclusive with only your ""brand"" being the leverage you have for success-- even if you are performing well or the hardest working. If you are looking to move verticals etc.. you can easily be blocked by your manager if they want to keep you for their self-interests. The management has created a self-serving environment where people don't really care or want you to have a fulfilling career. You will be shunned and humiliated in front of others if you speak up. It is not encouraged to give honest feedback."

5690,5.0,"Interoffice scuttlebutt is of course an issue, but it's not a problem unique to Salesforce by any means. In the division I am a part of, there is no formalized training or onboarding program, so the first couple weeks can be rough while you get acclimated.

5703,5.0,"Recruiting, finance, and other organizational infrastructure is not keeping pace with growth. Tension between freedom and control of product development (freedom is winning).

5705,2.0,"This place grew to fast too soon and tripled the # of employees in as many years. Coming from a big4 consulting background I was excited when I first joined. Only to find a hige divide between the techies(Platform) and the traditional(CRM) types. Internally they are afraid of each other and it is somewhat cannibalistic. Techies will find the CRM types are outdated, don't hava a clue and find it hard to adapt to the pure cloud vision. This place is good to get on your resume. Learn there technologies and hit the independent road if you want to make some real money in this over-hyped cloud/Saas market. Management is clueless and career development by a mentor is a joke as many legacy people are from the CRM space just trying not to get fired so they can hold on to their stock options. Their best employees go independent to tap the market while it is still hot. The spineless remain. Oh, did I mention the politics?"
5706,5.0,some times long hours and dead line driven
5707,3.0,- 24/7 - changing priorities - little empowerment
5708,2.0,"No work life balance even though they talk about it a lot. You'll be attending meeting at least 80% of your day. Actual work is usually done after the normal work day. If you enjoy being political, you will love this place. It's a huge company so it's not a fun ""start up"" type of place. They have camera's in the offices supposedly for ""security""."
5709,4.0,1. Very aggressive most of the time. Rarely have a free day unless I am on PTO or at a team activity.
5710,5.0,Working in such a large company means there are many projects with objectives that are hard to understand.

5713,5.0,"As one of 1,000 AE's, my territory hasn't gotten larger over the years, but I'm still able to make my numbers. It has become more competitive and account ownership between various segments has been increasingly political."
5714,5.0,Some politics. You have to have big wins in order to gain credibility. Small advancements often go completely unnoticed.
5715,3.0,"The company is not well organized and goes through reorganizations and direction changes frequently. Infrastructure is fragile, and management tends to throw people at issues to solve problems for the moment. Compensation is high because internal competition, long hours and management self-preservation make the company a difficult and trying place to work."

5718,4.0,Their R&D is mainly in San Francisco so the commute can be a pain if you commute from the South Bay.
5719,3.0,Insane workloads and expectations by management. Overtime is essentially required in order to meet quotas. Management makes a lot of lip service about work/life balance but it doesn't exist. Middle-management are all yes men who drink the company Kool-Aid and never listen to employee feedback. Management is usually head down into reports rather than actually working with their employees.
5720,5.0,Base salaries are a bit low
5721,5.0,Growth creates a culture and organization filled with constant change.There is general environment where you aren't allowed flexibility to work from home leading to feelings that their is a lack of trust between the employee and manager to act professionally.
5722,1.0,"The Support Organization is led by less-than-capable management, starting from the very top. Management styles here rely on scare tactics to try and keep you producing at 120%. Too many managers doing nothing but ""managing""; too few people doing the ""real"" work. Too much hype, too little substance. Absolutely no work-life balance."
5723,1.0,Micromanagement style gets old really fast.

5727,5.0,"On the verge of becoming a larger company. As such, trying to balance encouraging entrepreneurship with requirements of scaling as a large enterprise. A lot of snap decisions are made in terms of business goals, metrics and expectations without discussion of a larger roadmap on the departmental level or larger business context."
5728,5.0,The work is hard. Processes and systems are not as mature as most 5000 person companies. There is a lot of HQ centric thinking. I would (ad do) trade the positives for these issues any day.
5729,5.0,"The company needs to centralize their focus on competitors, it appears at times we are spreading the resources too thin by trying to invite all takers."
5730,4.0,Lots of cold calling and tele marketing

5732,4.0,With such fast growth teams can get out of touch with each other and priorities can shift so work you've spend a lot of time and energy on can quickly go by the wayside.
5733,4.0,"Lack of process, planning is poor in some areas. Some people in management believe that we are still a startup, which can be limiting. Staffing is lean and staff are very, very busy!"
5734,4.0,Since my time when the company was smaller and the culture was still fine I've heard that things have changed to the worse. This is somewhat natural given it's current size.
5735,2.0,The culture of every man for himself is pervasive - there is a sense of fear among employees.
5736,2.0,Overhired too many salespeople average attainment less than 40% Management feels thats appropriate 7 or 8 Salesreps per Sales engineer Micromanagement on lack of long term focus Extreme pettyness and incompetence
5737,4.0,Middle management needs improvement Internal career growth has not be good - I see a lot of hiring of middle management from outside instead of growing internal people Priority changes frequently at the lower level even with a clear big picture at the top Lots of political land mines to navigate Work life balance is given lip service but must be defended by the individual (probably related to poor middle management)

5760,2.0,"terrible middle-management, bullying of employees protected by HR, ability to get ahead rests solely on having a corporate ""sponsor"" internally (you get it) , bait and switch on territories, territories always very unequal even though they claim that they are all equal, high turnover has resulted in employees being given $10,000 spiffs this year for all hired sales referals - they claim this is due to growth but it is because AEs are often miserable, given an impossible job with an absurd quota, bullied until they experience physical and mental health problems (see ALL of the other reviews and associated comments posted here - click on the comments after each review, there are dozens or these reports), and then shown the door. you are either part of the ""old school"" crowd here who was with the company pre-IPO so like 5+ years at the company, or you are having a personal relationship with someone in management who is ""taking care of you,"" and then you are given preferential treatment i.e. vacation days not being tracked by your manager, cash-cow best territory year after year, etc. etc. ** OR YOU ARE NOT ** ... in which case you will probably not last here for more than 1-2 years, and probably not that long, because you will be treated poorly, given a territory that Benioff himself couldnt sell into (think rural Indiana and Idaho) and completely miserable. I can't count the # of AEs who fled this place in the 2009 timeframe - dozens. If you are crazy enough to take a job here, be sure you get the exact territory you will be covering written down as part of accepting the job offer - the bait and switch to lure people in here is well-known. You will be promised Chicago and leave your current job, get in the door, take your seat, and be given Louisiana (the boss' girlfriend will end up getting Chicago and no one will remember that you got told you were getting the Windy City - plus the boss' BF probably works in HR so no one to turn to in order to complain). Further, read ALL of the other reviews and comments here on Glassdoor.com - specifically the comments. Again there is a reason this company is giving out 10k referal bonuses to all employees who refer a salesperson who gets hired - and the employee(s) there will tell you how wonderful it is - they're desperate for new people to take the crap jobs so the AEs currently there get the good ones .... and the AEs want the 10k bonus for submitting your resume. They're so greedy for it - its all over LinkedIn constantly. PS - Don't believe the Forbes average salary hype either - that salary figure includes a tiny percentage of Sr. AEs who make $1M plus per year. Countless AEs didnt make jack above their base salary last year - ask about this. And if you get pushed out .... DO NOT LET THEM TALK YOU INTO SIGNING THEIR LEGAL WAIVERS TO PROTECT THEMSELVES"
5761,3.0,"management does not know how to handle a down economy or ensure that their sales team is motivated. there is some luck involved - you do not have to take a promotion if you do not think the territory will produce- research the trends - ask they will support your success- asks for more accounts- do what you need to be successful- because once you stop hitting your number, you will be asked to leave."
5762,5.0,territories move often stay in positions for a long period of time
5763,2.0,"Poor management, many of whom are legacy from the startup days at Salesforce and this was one of their first jobs (?!). Benevolent dictators are allowed among the mgmt ranks. There isn't a system for evaluating mgmt talent and their notion of ""360 degree feedback"" is a joke: it only flows downward so you never have the opportunity to evaluate management."
5764,2.0,Very political No life / work balance Overly metric happy - dashboards for everything Sales process too focused on short term goals
5765,2.0,"This is not a company for working mothers. Insane work hours, lack of growth and denied requests for part-time employment are often common. I know 2 women (who returned to work after having a baby) are leaving because their manager told them that a job share or part-time was simply out of the question. really? what century are we living in when a good employee has to leave because of lack of respect for different work-life priorities."

5769,4.0,Decision making is still done through silos
5770,3.0,"Salesforce.com moves at light speed, and is filled with overachievers. On top of these, expectations on one's performance are always high. The result of this is that you will constantly be struggling to achieve a balanced work/life ratio. Salesforce.com is fun, and it can be fun to get completely involved, and to immerse yourself in your work. However, you will find that working nights and weekends is pretty much a requirement to keep up with the pace, management expectations, and your coworkers. Unless your a workaholic, this gets old, and is probably the main reason why people end up leaving the company."
5771,2.0,"Politics Beware of Mid & senior level managers. They spend a lot of time trying to get projects, even if it mean screwing people who report to them. Unless you have a sugar daddy in management, don't expect promotions !!!"
5772,4.0,Product metrics are really hard to come by - it could take 4 months+ just to learn if anyone is using what my team had built.
5773,3.0,"Too many gunners, not enough true team players. Most middle management are terrible people managers...they are really high-level individual contributors who are just thrown into those roles."
5774,2.0,Very inexperienced top management. They seem to be mostly home grown with little experience working in the industry. Culture of back-stabbing staff and partners. Compnay vision is great but management is very political and short-sighted.
5775,4.0,"Code base is showing it's age, basic design of 5 or 6 years ago didn't scale as well as it could have. Hard to get good feedback on new ideas, you get very different answers to the same question, depends on who you are talking to. From the inside, terrible sale team, very cut throat."

5778,3.0,"- Established company with startup expectations for its employees. Overtime is expected, double and triple loading of duties on one person is normal. - High level of ""internal marketing"". A great deal of effort is spent in pushing the latest company kool-aid to the employees. Often difficult to tell fact from fiction, even for in-the-know insiders. - Highly political work environment. Prepare to be stabbed in the back for no particular reason. Prepare for nasty knife fights over resources and head count. Prepare for the frequent ""executive drive by"", where a so-called SVP of Strategy will saunter over and smile while he drops a grenade in your lap. - Constant restructuring. My first year I reported to 5 difference direct reports, due to restructuring of where our group ""belonged"". - There is a clique culture of old-timers. Often referred to as ""Marc direct hires"", which is code for ""untouchable"". Craggy rocks you need to navigate around in order to get things done."
5779,3.0,"Very little team orientation - individuals want to be the superstar Immature management - lack of support, no prioritization of projects, constantly changing direction Managers do not value/appreciate individuals' skills and contribution Startup mentality - and the company is too big for that Chaotic environment does not always foster good thinking and decision-making"
5780,2.0,"One of the most stressful, high strung and political modern corporate environments outside of wall street...and it all starts from the very top. The CEO suffers from a big blind spot when it comes to running the company: he rules by diktat, asks for zero feedback, micromanages ad nauseum, and is a firm believer in the Art of War as management philosophy: his directs compete aggressively for his attention and approval and never openly disagree with him. He still runs the shop as if the company was a start-up and he had the insight to make calls on day to day minutia. Salesforce is quickly becoming internally bureaucratic and clunky; innovation, creativity and risk taking are highly discouraged. Long hours, zero respect for family or personal time (emailing and working on weekends and late at night is a widely accepted practice)."

5807,5.0,"The monthly quota can burn people out. At times it feels like a burnout but then again, if we factor in the nature of sales in general, it's not bad. I can see the upside. Sales can be difficult especially in a recession however, with a product that people use, and talk about, I'm not too concerned."

5815,3.0,"Office politics here are killer. If you're great at backstabbing your colleagues this is the company for you. Little attention paid to strong performers. Instead, it's all about who can brown-nose the most. If you're good at this type of thing, salesforce will be great for you. However, if you're looking to be awarded for your achievements rather than your networking skills, look elsewhere."

5818,5.0,"long hours, confusion around org structure"
5819,1.0,"incredibly political; upper management shouts a lot; most managers are terrifed to even speak. promotions are based on who you know and how loud you shout rather than how talented you are. very toxic working environment. tremendous focus on the sales automation side, with a bizarre model of hiring more and more salespeople to flog the product, guaranteeing individual salespeople's revenue will be lower; they then fire the lower 10% of all salespeople every three months, so turnover is high and morale is in the toilet. 4000 employees but only 150 engineers; very sales heavy."
5820,2.0,The territories are treated as though they each have the same sales potential with each having the same quota. Though in reality the territories are not the same and each year the territories get smaller and smaller while the the quota rises. The company is satisfied with having only 55% achieve their quotas and qualify for club because they don't expect 45% of the reps to attain their quotas. So 45% of the reps are set up for failure. They also bait and switch territories as a way to attract talent. They make you a job offer for a particular territory only to tell you after you have been hired and left your previous job that your territory has changed...and typically the new territory is not of the same caliber and potential of what was promised. Also when a new sales rep joins the company they find that their territory has been cherry picked by several reps on their sales team each having hold outs preventing you from selling into these accounts for up to 90 days. And there is no quota relief for this lost revenue potential.

5826,2.0,"Career feedback and coaching is non-existent. If you're in a non-critical role, you're fine. If you have people depending on you, good luck with getting insight on how to improve. As other people have noted, it's very much who you know and how you play the game. If you are connected to the right people, the path gets much smoother than if you don't. Hours are long and the work expectations are borderline excessive."

They don't sell or get involved in deals or support their team, just send out snapshots of everyone's performance. -Politics, politics, politics -Brown nosing is absolutely required. Numbers don't speak for themselves -HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE/SUPPORT--trust me. I can go on and on."
5829,1.0,"The politics in play prevent you from doing your job. You are not recognized for performance, and there are limited opportunities for growth. Salesforce overworks and underpays employees in key roles while rewarding employees in roles that are less critical. You are subjected to trial by fire with little or no management support."

There are VPs with no direct reports. yes, believe it or not. if you are starting your career, go some place else. mid career workers with blue chip experience elsewhere, this might be a place to come in and institute some discipline."
5834,1.0,"1. Any signed contract whether in sales, technology or consulting is most likely bait and switch. Consulting : Promised 90 days ramp up. Given: 30 due to needs. Result: Project failure, bullying by staff over lack of knowledge. Denial: ""We give our staff plenty of training to succeed in their jobs"". Result: Customers not satisfied with deliverables because new consultants can not succeed with training; attrition. Technology: Big red letters on ramp up page. ""If you want to take a day off to take care of your kid, thats called PTO"". So beware those sorry people who have children. Expect 9pm exits from work most days. Sales: Promised territories, good prospects, etc. Reality used car sales. Micro deals that burns you out. They rotate you to a new territory every 6 months so you never get comfortable. Poor client relations skills because Sales Manager or SE manager is always in room watching you. Ive seen better treatment at my Chevy dealer of the reps who atleast are comfortable in their pants. SRs who even show an emotion or personality are singled out from the mindless phone dialers who cold call prospects. No vacation. You'll get an email from your manager asking where you are or at best be able to only take 1 weeks vacation."
5835,5.0,The pace is very rapid and managing work life balance can be difficult. There is so much to do and yet so little time. At times salesforce.com seems to be heavy in chiefs and not many indians.

5837,5.0,"The company is committed to regularly delivering products that are of high quality and delivered on time. That means that the pace and volume of work is significant. This is not a great place to work if you are just looking to put in your time. That said, the company accommodates flexible schedules and really does care about work-life balance."
5838,3.0,lower/mid management not always best qualified
5839,5.0,"The hours are definitely long, no doubt about that. There are never enough people on board to do all the work necessary. There's always a certain amount of chaos. Salesforce definitely exhibits some qualities usually reserved for startups in that regard -- every day is challenging, but it sure makes going to work fun."
5840,2.0,"Oh how to list these. Senior Management needs to stop worshiping itself and actually run the company and stop being a yes man to Marc B. If he farts, they say, oh Marc, it smells like Teen Spirit. No, honestly, that idea doesn't stink at all. Marketing is a sink hole of money at salesforce. They've pretty much promoted the CMO from within, when others wouldn't come aboard to run the department. While I was there, all they managed to hire was a slew of VP's and Directors into marketing. So for marketing, I would say it's very, very top heavy, with no one to do the actual work. They have this thing called a V2MOM that should be eliminated. No one follows it, no one understands it, and how can you follow it when it changes all the time."
5841,4.0,"The pace of change and new features added into the products causes a heavy burden to stay current, but then that is what attracts a lot of people to this company, the pace of change and making change in the industry.

5845,3.0,There is no such thing as work life balance.
5846,3.0,"The promotion path there can be very stagnant. As a fast growing organization there are continue new hires and the internal promotion path can take longer than what is originally discussed.

5847,5.0,"Because of the relatively small team, there's a lot for everyone to do, and that leads to long hours. This is better than having a lot of people, though, since you will end up with more mediocre staff dragging the talented people down."
5848,4.0,There is an excessive amount of disorganization and politics. Every day is another marketing event fire drill - merely a result of CEO who is a master marketer for better or worse. Learning to navigate the organization requires a long ramp time.
5849,4.0,Too many folks think they're alpha dogs
5850,4.0,"Sometimes a boys club and the company doesn't enforce the ""no-asshole"" rule. A few people are more motivated by politics or what's in it for them and aren't willing to step up and do what's right for the company or the team. This is probably true everywhere, but it's disappointing that at sfdc these people end up getting rewarded."

5862,4.0,"Company is struggling with it's identify in some areas. Too many specialists serving a single customer. Often times you need to bring the entire office with you because there is a specialist for different functions (sales, service, cpq, commerce, marketing, oms , analytics, integration, trailhead, ). The frequency that salesforce changes their reps and alignment doesn't tend to sit well with most customers. This has created a struggle to expand, particularly in the enterprise space. Poor alignment between cloud teams for GTM. Most ""generalists"" or ""Account Directors"" are compensated for the efforts of specialists although they don't pull their weight. Many recent reps are fairly green and do not possess the maturity to run a proper sales cycle. Some specialists are running rogue/lone-wolf engagements which can torpedo deals/relationships. Management seems very metric driven, to a fault. Some executive leadership and middle management have no boundaries and will bombard your mobile on weekends. Often times they will assert themselves in your deals and cannibalize any value you've created by offering quarterly discounts to bring them forward."
5863,5.0,"There is a lot to learn as a new employee, so you will spend your weekends and late nights getting up to speed. There is also continuous change and new initiatives so its a challenge to stay on top of things. This will suit over achievers but I think the work life balance is not great."

They will sideline you in all aspect. 3. You can't raise your concern to the HR or ethics department because there also telgu management and at the end they will prove that you are wrong. 4. Managers and Recruiters will highly exploit the employee Referral program . They will only refer and hire there known person to add more Telgu person in the team. No transparency in hiring and stopping the right talent to come in. I am not targeting or blaming Telgu people here but it is the people who are making the culture more Toxic here. Non-telgu will be minority highly exploited community here."
5865,5.0,"1. Some teams work is very boring, no growth at all. 2.Stock is given for first 4 years only, stock refreshers are not given to below PMTS role which is why people leave the company after 4 years. 3.Some product managers spoil the culture but nothing to do with the company culture."

The company grew too much during the pandemic, but didn't hire enough engineers to back up the new volume. The company is hiring more sales and not investing in their engineers. They are blind on their 50 billion revenue target, not caring how to achieve that sustainably. Everyone is overworked, stressed and there is no improvements in sight.

I called to ask for clarification and the offer was immediately pulled - less than 48 hours after it was extended -- as a direct consequence of ""asking questions"". Bizarre, appalling, and entirely illegal (pressuring a candidate to sign under duress, breach of contract, etc) and unethical practice. Be prepared with a good lawyer if you want to work here.

The company offers many great opportunities for personal and career development, volunteering, mentoring, special interest groups, health, wellness, and inspirational meetings, and pushes employees hard to take advantage of them, but in order to stay caught up on your work you'll have to say no to almost all of them."
6116,4.0,"Very political, under valued on short staffed team"
6117,5.0,To many people from Oracle turning into mini Oracle.
6118,5.0,I honestly can’t think of any

6125,5.0,"The company has gotten very large, and it's hard to find your place in it sometimes, or effect meaningful systemic change."
6126,3.0,Arrogant account directors. Management lack leadership. Spend more time on administrative tasks and less on selling.

6140,5.0,Promotions are sometimes favoritism internally
6141,4.0,somewhat slow moving and lacking in innovation
6142,4.0,Unlimited time off is hard to utilize under manager approval when project deadline is aggressive
6143,4.0,FTO is a real myth as it all depends on your manager. I've never seen this model to work in any company as you have to beg your manager for time off and usually that means delayed workflow or getting someone else to cover. Not a practical vacation policy. Would rather see PTO based on time served and get that paid out when I leave the company.
6144,5.0,Absolutely no cons so far.
6145,5.0,Total package not comparable with FAAG
6146,5.0,Getting very large in size
6147,5.0,Not as many perks as some other tech companies (no company cafeteria)
6148,5.0,Company is good and good work culture
6149,3.0,"Underneath the facade, Salesforce is focused on perception more than reality. VTO isn't volunteer time off at all. It's voluntold time on-top (of existing work load) for most of the company. We have targets for VTO set, but many business units aren't staffed appropriately to actually take the time off. Instead it's just adding work load on top of our existing work load. Also, the company really exemplifies the wealth gap, with those at the top heavily rewarded with expensive trips, awards (including cars, watches, etc.) while the majority of the company is paid somewhere around the 75th percentile of industry. We once had a travel freeze but the company still sent the top 100+ employees to a big shindig in Hawaii - and they broadcast it and insisted that everyone across the company ""tune in"" to it remotely. Wow."
6150,5.0,Getting bigger all the time.
6151,1.0,"CSG leadership is very political. I had a VP who was not transparent on promotions and had his favorites. Lacked vision within my org and true understanding of how to develop a true service. I felt very lonely, disconnected and lost trust due to the politics. I always thought I had the golden handcuffs at Salesforce. Not true! Ultimately, I was recruited away and it was a blessing in disguise. I am happier, found my smile again and propelling in my career. My new employer values me and my contributions. In addition, but subsequent, pay much higher, RSU refresh."
6152,5.0,None that I can think off
6153,1.0,"Inexperienced management, no desire to advance, red tape"
6154,5.0,The company is big and a lot of your success is contingent on who your direct manager is.
6155,4.0,Sales team structure too complex and too many people involved. Low ball on comp packages
6156,5.0,Busy Schedule A LOT to learn
6157,5.0,- competitive interview process - fast-paced environment
6158,5.0,None really to share - don't expect this to be a startup
6159,1.0,Trust - Don't believe what they promise you. They won't keep their word Focus has shifted from how to care for employees and customers to how to make more money It's Oracle with a better PR department. Expect layoffs every quarter
6160,3.0,They under hire because its Salesforce and then place you in a role thats isn't motivating and expect you to give it your all. Commissions are low for a tech company.
6161,1.0,"Doesn't care about technical innovation, not a ideal place for engineers No transparency, the Ohana family value is just a slogan... They let go people on maternity leave on a record quarter amidst a global pedemic. Very disappointed...."
6162,4.0,Communications - hard to sift through what is relevant for the job function. Too much information could be hard to digest for some.
6163,1.0,Dream job is an utopia. Laid off with other 1k or 2k people after 5 years of honored service. Don’t think SF will be on your side. Don’t believe the ohana culture. Only marketing scam.
6164,5.0,"Pay is good but not as high as Google, Microsoft, AWS, etc."
6165,5.0,"Politics, Corporate Shiny Toy Syndrome (priority switching)."
6166,1.0,Cult-like culture; poor management - groups like platform led by fear and intimidation; decisions not data driven; inflation of titles causes lots of people in leadership that are not equipped to do their roles; there’s a huge backstabbing and political culture. They say customers and employees are priorities but there is no evidence to support any of this - in fact it is quite the opposite. Leadership is so out of touch with people and customers and the world that they constantly disappoint.
6167,5.0,Consistent hiring freezes for how fast they say they want to grow
6168,5.0,Not sure of any Cons currently
6169,5.0,None I can think of.

6173,5.0,"Grueling work and at an extremely fast pace, but at the same time, Salesforce encourages employees to focus on wellbeing"
6174,5.0,So far... 1. Lots of process
6175,2.0,People will backstab you without a question. Re Org Constantly and no choice of where you work or who your boss is. They preach Ohana and family..but if I had family that treated me like this I would not consider them family. You have 0 input unless your suck up or sr mgmt. Your opinion will not matter no matter what. SCRUM LOL - they don't even know what the word is or even Agile for that matter. It's so stupid
6176,5.0,None that I can think about it.
6177,3.0,"Politics, hard to get promoted"
6178,5.0,"- monthly forecasting (big company, high accountability to monthly numbers) - sometimes hard to navigate but overall people are willing to help - product is highest priced in market (good and bad, very competitive space)"
6179,5.0,"No commuter stipend, no student loan repayment"
6180,4.0,"Onboarding, support, communication, leads, pipeline"
6181,5.0,Salesforce has gotten so big that some processes are much slower due to the corporate nature of the company
6182,5.0,"Get ready to roll your sleeves up and work hard. Can be complex, but great teams to help you every step of the way!"
6183,5.0,"Fast-paced work environment that if you are unprepared for, you may always feel constantly behind. Need to be flexible and adaptive as expectations while transparent are fluid and tend to change along with a lot of aspects of the role."
6184,5.0,Legacy systems and code can steal away time.
6185,4.0,It can be demanding at times
6186,4.0,"Sometimes feel a bit slow, but depends on the team you are on"
6187,4.0,Slow development process that can lead to features going to production at a slower pace.
6188,5.0,"Politics. If you have only worked at small companies, big companies are a different beast. Salesforce, like any big company, has an element of politicking to it. At any company playing ""the game"" is important, so expect that here. Large quotas, and small patches. Salesforce has fine tuned territory management, and some ae's have stronger patches than others. It is important to succeed early and often so that you have the credibility to be assigned stronger accounts. New employees not willing to hustle and prove themselves do not last. This is how every big company is in my experience. If you don't have a ton of sales experience, make sure you start at a lower title with a larger territory. Big companies are harder to ""learn the ropes at"", as you are competing with the best of the best for things like territory. Other than the above, Salesforce has been the best move in my career, and I'm thrilled and proud to work here. I've never found a place without the above cons, and the pros far outweigh them for me."
6189,4.0,"Too structured, lots of hoops to jump through"
6190,5.0,I have no negative sentiment
6191,4.0,Sometimes you just work too much!!!
6192,5.0,"Few tech jerks, lot of meetings"
6193,5.0,"Started during 1 month prior to Covid, which has impacted my ability to get face to face with customers and colleagues. Makes it more challenging to connect on a personal level."
6194,5.0,-End of the quarter can be stressful
6195,5.0,None that I can think about it.
6196,5.0,"There are soooo many opportunities to learn new things, sometimes it is hard to focus."
6197,5.0,Nothing bad I can say.
6198,4.0,"Salesforce is obviously massive, and with that, comes a lot of processes that are already in place. It is very tough to be agile in the company as any change requires layers of approval."
6199,5.0,nothing.Its just amazing to be in here
6200,5.0,I have yet to experience any.
6201,5.0,They took away overtime which was how they justified lower than average base salaries.
6202,5.0,"Not as much work with journal entries, which can also not be a con if you are more interested in revenue operations."
6203,4.0,There is not too much innovation
6204,4.0,"I did say ""caveats"". -RSUs are low as compared to FAANG and there are no refreshers - hence, there are a lot of boomerangs, and a reputation as a ""retirement home"", because there is no reward for working harder if you are not also trying to get promoted. -Despite claiming to have a culture of open debate, it doesn't exist and there is seemingly no motivation to change this. For example, even though they say they will answer forum questions relating to the weekly allhands, they never do if it pertains to an internal policy. There is no upward feedback mechanism, except for your direct manager, and on many teams this is a ""player/coach"" who has no involvement in setting the policies of the department. There is an ""airing of grievances"" forum but it is heavily ""tone-policed"". Bottom line is that if you get stuck in a bad situation or team, your options are to change teams or leave, there is no opportunity to improve things from within. -Silos and a lack of coordination result in many internally competitive and duplicative efforts, and inefficiencies. Product-wise there is crossover between Marketing Cloud and Pardot, Tableau and Einstein; and Vlocity/CPQ/B2B Commerce for example. Whatever's new and shiny (acquisitions and Dreamforce announcements) gets love, but if your area is not, good luck getting Trailhead modules or product management to prioritize new feature development. There are approximately 90 billion different efforts to create documentation for consulting resources for how to do their job, all run by different groups and stored on different platforms. And because Slack and Microsoft are viewed as competitors, there is no company-wide collaboration tool like Slack or Teams, it's just a bunch of incomplete tools like Google Chat and Salesforce Chatter and Quip and email and.... -There tends to be a lot of politics between teams, even beyond the product-related competitive/redundancy issues. In short, if you like what you're doing, and who you're doing it for/with, you're in a great position. But if you don't, you're going to have a bad time. I don't know anyone who was unhappy with their situation in Salesforce who subsequently made it better, at least without changing teams."
6205,5.0,I have not come across any cons in working for Salesforce.
6206,5.0,Not as many perks as some other tech companies (no company cafeteria)
6207,5.0,"Constant reorganizations can be fatiguing and a lot of them were terribly ineffective, but is to be expected with a company that challenges convention constantly. It has also been frustrating how often you will change managers, makes it very important to promote yourself up your management tree."
6208,5.0,Very fast paced which is motivating and inspiring but can sometimes be overwhelming.
6209,5.0,Tools for daily work are complicated or antiquated or too many in use.
6210,5.0,Base salary is very low
6211,4.0,"The pressure is always very high to make your numbers as a sales professional. As a growing organization (~14,000 employees), it can be slow to see material change to broken processes. With the growing number of acquisitions, the integration process can be very slow."
6212,5.0,"Roadmap sometimes is unclear IT policies are a pain to work with Big company, so sometimes it's hard to find information you need"
6213,5.0,Technology in infrastructure can be improved Workplace can be quieter to enable more individual work Different groups work in silos
6214,4.0,"May face some challenges in collaboration. Can be an ego-driven environment. The company is extremely fast-paced and intense. For those who like a more laid-back environment, it can be a quite stressful environment. The company is growing so quickly that it sometimes feel like more of a start-up."
6215,5.0,"They will work you to death, but they certainly compensate you for it. Pockets of very aggressive and non collaborative people in senior level positions."
6216,5.0,"Sometimes the work can be overwhelming, but between release, it's heaven."
6217,3.0,Lots of priorities and hard to keep track of which is more important
6218,4.0,"Politics, lack of trained managers"
6219,5.0,Long Hours are not fun
6220,3.0,"Not all managers are supportive of internal movement. They need to learn that people are not property. If someone is ready to move on to a different role, they will do regardless, if not within they'll leave the company. It's sad to see how much great talent has left salesforce in the last couple of year because of lack of support for internal movement. Also, salary increase with promotions are often not fair -- the salary is often increased by percentage of an employees' current salary and not necessarily what the new role is actually worth and valued in the market. This is making many internal employees feel less valued and increasing the chances for attrition."
6221,5.0,"growing too fast lot of middle level management getting created very fast, losing the flat hierarchy"
6222,3.0,too short focused and does not value long term relationships with customers
6223,3.0,"-The days of rapid growth are over, some territories and accounts do really well, others struggle. There is a core group of Account Executives that make their numbers, for the rest its a revolving door. -Critical to success is getting a good territory and having a good manager. -Salesforce is in a fight to be the next platform... to do that they need to hit big sales numbers... its a war and there will be casualties. Don't be surprised if you are one of them. -Salesforce's own implementation of Salesforce is a Frankenstein disaster. Account data is a mess too. When I was given my territory I had almost three hundred accounts. After I went through all of them to see what was real I actually only had 40. It was a tremendous waste of time and makes it difficult to really assess the market opportunity."
6224,5.0,"Not a con, but if you can't handle a fast pace environment, this may not be the place for you."
6225,5.0,Lack of Inter-team communication and transparency
6226,4.0,Micromanagement - Understandable with all the fresh out of college folk.
6227,5.0,its hours at times can feel too long
6228,3.0,Territory carving is a mess. Veterans have the lions share of accounts- install and whitespace yet all AEs have the same quota. Small percentage of AEs actually make OTE....if you do then you're in Club! I'd rather have a real shot at hitting OTE!! Multiyear bookings result in a higher quota the following year that actually negates any increase in year 1 compensation...why? where's the incentive
6229,4.0,There is not a lot of executive alignment in priorities and initiatives that trickle down. The impact is largest on those teams that have to implement with competing priorities and minimal resources.
6230,5.0,company is growing quickly and might be harder for new people to move up quick
6231,5.0,"SF is changing as it needs different structure and methods to grow and hit it's revenue goals. Some of the change is necessary, but there is concern that the baby may be going with the bath water."
6232,5.0,"autonomy, at times I feel like another cog :("
6233,3.0,Not competitive base salary - base salary has increased $2K with 3 promotions in 4 years All about making your manager and their manager more money. Compensation is not competitive anymore Culture has shifted and fun has been sucked out of the job. Declined in quality of new hires and the next generation of Salesforce employees and leaders. New leadership No work life balance Increase middle management creating more red tape and dissatisfied employees Salesforce say we are about diversity but 1 person is of color and 2 women on the executive committee. And we don't get MLK day off as a holiday
6234,4.0,"Territory determines everything. Culture is not ""as advertised"" by the HQ in San Francisco."
6235,5.0,"We are growing super fast, so things change and move quickly. It's really exciting, but we change direction a lot."
6236,3.0,Become very political. Lots of CYA now.
6237,5.0,"As a big company constantly going through growth phases, it's challenging to align across so many engineering teams and business units, but Salesforce does an excellent job nevertheless, as shown by our customer enthusiasm and Dreamforce debuts."
6238,5.0,"- The only constant is change, you have to stay nimble."
6239,2.0,Highest turnover company in Fortune 500. Lots of politics and benefit is not great compare to other silicon valley companies.
6240,3.0,The wheel is reinvented all the time
6241,1.0,Upper management (engineering) is incompetent and is killing the company
6242,4.0,"Feature areas can be siloed, and your success depends a lot on the people around you (including manager, PM, and scrum team). Could be more agile."
6243,5.0,None! This is a great place to be.
6244,5.0,"The innovative culture is starting to be tainted by the recent ""Big Company"" feel and imported Sr. Management from Oracle. Very hard driving culture leads for little to no work/life balance."
6245,4.0,The Public Sector team has a bad culture
6246,2.0,"- Beware of the smoke and mirrors. Lots of hype around the ""#dreamjob"", but they don't tell you the pie has been cut so many times that a very small percentage of people actually achieve their goals. - Land of haves and have-nots. Despite AE's at the same level sharing the same quota, there is no effort to balance the account sets. It's extremely important that you ask to see your account set and license footprint before accepting the job. - Salesforce grew up from the SMB so the Enterprise group is run like SMB with a very short-term mindset and a monthly cadence. - Much of the support of the organization comes at the last minute after the selling is done and the deal is in the final stages."
6247,1.0,The most politically divisive environment I've ever worked in. More a collection of shires protecting their territory than a fully-functioning company. Most importantly--a non-viable product in a fast-changing marketplace.
6248,2.0,"Culture is disintegrating at a shocking pace. Focus on the customer is now all but absent. No concern left for work/life balance. Focus is now on reports, updates and stuff to make the department leaders look good. All at the expense of doing the work that matters."
6249,3.0,"It's a company for sales people who sell to sales people. While it's not cut throat, it does require a level of social agility to be successful."
6250,3.0,"Things definitely changing after purchase by SalesForce.com. Becoming much more bureaucratic and annoying. Much less mutual respect and trust and much more ""top-down"" management approach. Before SF purchase, you were a cog in the wheel in the hands of a loving watchmaker. After SF purchase, you are a cog in the wheel on the wrist of an aggrandizing marketing ""visionary"". Way understaffed. Morale is at an all-time low after purchase."
6251,2.0,"Unfair/low pay for some high for others Management plays too many games - making false promises for promotion and pay raise with job offers they WILL NOT hold Unexperienced middle management perpetrate poor management style For employees needing sponsorship - they put a hold on my green card application for about 6 months with no explanation Not challenging work, not much learning nor growth No cutting edge technology or industry standard (mostly proprietary stuffs) Depending on the team, people can be very cut-throat Overall this is an environment where people are afraid to take risks because any mistake can and likely will be used against you"
6252,3.0,"Culture promotes self-preservation, finger-pointing and shirking responsibility for failure. Cutthroat, uncollaborative, immature management -- diminishing from the EVP level down."
6253,4.0,"Getting to be a ""big company"" with the big company type of red-tape, no 360 degree review process, so some senior managers are able to treat their people cannon fodder and without accountability as long as they make their numbers or ""manage up"" and show a good face to the senior boss above them."
6254,4.0,Work is not as exciting unless you LOVE enterprise software. Self imposed workaholism
6255,3.0,Growth engine so they are hiring a ton of people. Wall Street doesn't care about profits as long as the growth is there. Too many sales reps and not enough to go around.
6256,5.0,it is a fast moving company and the pace is not for everyone.
6257,1.0,"As with any big company, the team you are on can drastically change your experience here but I am going to try to point out some of the general things. Also of note, before you read too much into the other reviews, take the time to notice how many of the 5 star reviews are can be summed up by ""great place to work but has growing pains"" or ""you get what you put in, slackers need not apply"". I will let you draw your own conclusion on why so many of these reviews sound like marketing message .... It doesnt look like ExactTarget understands that they are no longer a startup. The only people that thrive at ExactTarget are people that have no lives. 50+ hours of work a week is the norm and anyone that does less is considered a ""slacker"" as you might have seen in some of these other reviews. If you do the math, you'll realize that the decent paycheck, which is typically higher than the industry norm, ultimately falls woefully short when you look at how much you make an hour. As you work here, you come to find out that it is very much a cult mindset and you are either in or out. Job security comes from owning tribal knowledge of projects that are integrated in to the platform since documentation is apparently a running joke. There are many processes that have been implemented to ""streamline"" development but apparently the management style here is to implement ""solutions"" and ignore the results because the only thing that these processes have done is add one more point of failure to an already broken system. Contractors are treated as second class citizens. Its common knowledge. The way to get ahead is to brown nose and give up on life outside work. ET is founded on the principle that the reward for a job well done is an opportunity to do more. After the Salesforce acquisition morale and productivity have been at an all time low while frustrations and turn over have been on the other side of the scale."
6258,3.0,"From the technology/infrastructure perspective, ""Trust"" (their word for security) seems to overrule anything else -- it gets in the way of work."
6259,2.0,"Arrogency, bad politics in everywhere in Engineering group. Never want to take new technologies in their system. They hate new technologies, so you will get bored very soon. Very sarcastic culture due to a few very high position persons in Engineering. This company is not IT company. If you extect"
6260,4.0,"Fast growth means fast paced work environment. This keeps the job very exciting but also challenges in terms of changing priorities, ""fire drills"" and decisions being made without putting a lot of thought into future impact."
6261,3.0,1. Not very engineering centric organization
6262,5.0,"Copmany is growing too quickly, possibly causing growing pains (but haven't seen it yet!)"
6263,5.0,Not enough hours in the day to take advantage of all the benefits and learning and personal development opportunities that are available !
6264,4.0,Salary is a bit lower than competitors
6265,5.0,Constant change results in lost communication.
6266,2.0,"No work-life balance. Your manager will make or break your experience here. At one point a manager I reported to implemented an attendance policy which docked people for being sick. Sound ridiculous? Probably, but it's completely true. Salesforce is a SALES company first and a TECH company second. Goals often seem more important than people."
6267,5.0,"Company is growing very fast, and with that comes layers and layers of management."
6268,5.0,constant change of senior executives and their priorities
6269,5.0,Resource constraints require you to focus on short-term urgent projects to complete versus being able to focus on longer term strategies and success.
6270,5.0,"Beginning to get much more ""big company"" - more red tape, etc just to get the job done."
6271,4.0,"It's getting very political with the change of the guard to a more Oracle centric management team. Territories are thinly sliced and watered down unless you're in the good graces of your manager or the most senior person on your team, and if you're stuck with a bad one someone has to leave or get promoted for you to get a bigger slice. Work life balance is so/so...each manager determines if you can work from home with no real ""program"". Base salaries are below average in the industry."
6272,3.0,"Over the last year it’s been sad to see how drastically the company has changed. The “orange” culture is fading rapidly and key employees who cashed-out on stock options are jumping ship for better opportunities. Prominent executives recently left the company and top talent is leaving in droves. A massive restructuring is in order and I suspect that others will follow suit once the fiscal year ends and annual bonuses are paid out to employees. If you work out of the Indy office, you can sense the heightened frustration from those around you. Employees are overworked, underpaid, and have huge unrealistic quotas hung over their heads (with shrinking sales territories). What used to be a company driven by young, ambitious, entrepreneurial talent, is slowly turning into a company motivated by corporate greed and pleasing Wall Street. Two years ago, things were very different but now it is much harder to get promoted, receive a pay raise, or advance your career vertically. ET is very demanding and is notorious for promoting the same people (Director level and above) over and over again. Rarely will you see someone without an MBA or Director-level title, get promoted (unless they brown-nose like crazy)."
6273,2.0,"Salesforce operates on the verge of Chaos. They act like a $3M company when its really a $3B company. Very little thought of planning goes in to anything. This drives a culture of groups just doing ""something"". This drives tons of inefficiency and work done for nothing. The company is extremely hierarchical. Asking questions or participating in the process is frowned upon. The top dogs of a group make a decision and its just go do it. There is no seat at the table for discussion."
6274,5.0,"corporate politics (as you will likely find anywhere) can be draining I am in the Sales organization and they really try to funnel you up in Sales and don't encourage cross-department transitions Sometimes felt under-valued, disposable"
6275,2.0,"Small territories, nepotism, highly political, short sighted goals and management, in the office 8-6pm. Do not go there if you have some sales experience as they heavily favor existing sales people."
6276,4.0,"""Fillers"". I call them ""fillers"" because that's what they are...people that were hired in haste to simple fill roles in an organization that is growing so fast, they had to be hired quickly. While they may have gone through multiple rounds of interviews, it seems there are many execs that got through that shouldn't have and are just filling a role in the org chart. And they don't do s*&^. They may have had extremely successful positions at other companies, but Salesforce isn't like other companies. They only slow you down...so if you're smart and have your i's dotted and t's crossed, just go over them and it's not really looked down upon. Tomorrow. You're only as good as the deal you have committed tomorrow. Doesn't matter if you're at 200% of quota for the year 6 months into it ...that actually only amplifies what is expected of you. It's a con...but in reality...it's also not too bad...unless you're in a Sales role that isn't an AE (i.e. SE) because you're capped. Salesforce has the SE's I've ever come across in the industry, and I don't think they're treated as fairly as they should be. Marketeering. This is a new issue at Salesforce... It used to be the case that marketing & PM were in line and no one sold on futures. Over the past 12 months, that has changed...moving closer to an Oracle-like model where the vision is pitched and then they try to build it. Equity. I'm not sure who is getting it, but it isn't long term sales people. Seekingalpha? They couldn't be more wrong. Granted, the ESPP program is fantastic, but once you get beyond entry level, it would be nice to see something. It can be disheartening to hear RVP's (in 2012 I swear they only brought in people as RVP's...""What? You're an RVP of WHAT? And have no reports?!?!?"") and other new employees talking about selling their RSU's or options when they haven't really done anything for the company yet and you've committed the better part of a decade. Commit. This is probably the biggest ""Con"" at Salesforce if you're an AE or in sales. Salesforce is an accurate machine...it really is...based on the subscription model, a great portion of deferred rev is already established and known...but they want your sales opps just as accurate and mgmt will force or override you on your deals if you think differently. Territory. Don't come to Salesforce thinking you'll be able to pick and choose. It was picked over 5 years ago. You'll more than likely get something you don't want. End of discussion. While it seems like it should be the biggest ""con"", it's not. Because everything I listed in the ""Pros"" section means you will constantly have something new and innovative to sell to that minuscule territory you have that no one else can. I mentioned in the ""Pros"" section that some of the long-termers (those that have been around 10+ years) are one of the best things about the company. They ARE. There are also a handful of high level execs that just need to go...they don't do anything...they show up at meetings and say hello and leave... and you better keep your mouth shut. It sucks. Because at one time they were amazing. Now, just awful."

6280,2.0,"The politics of the UX team have changed for the worst within the last year. Attrition is so high, people have left the team in droves. Management seemed to have wanted that so they can clean house. People are dispensable and not invested in, and it had become a culture where speaking your opinion isn't appreciated, especially in a public forum and especially if it differs from what the leadership thinks. Significant lack of trust in the abilities of most of the designers ( except for the chosen bros ) If you like taking orders and being told what to think this place is for you. If you believe in changing the world, you won't do it here. And don't even think about unconventional design thinking. That's reserved for the designers who are ""smarter"" than you."

I was hopeful with the acquisition but it hasn't been what I had hoped at all. There's been several people who have been let go from sales and for the first time in nearly 4 years of working here I am nervous about potentially losing my job. It's really sad as a year ago I could have seen being here for a large part of my career but I guess thats tech, ever changing, and volatile. I would be cautious about taking a sales job with ExactTarget right now, they keep hiring but its because people keep leaving for better opportunities, lots of uncertainty going on, the good people are getting out and I will be leaving as soon as I find a new opportunity."

6350,1.0,"After three years here I had wanted to transfer to another department. I applied, and before it hit the hiring manager's mailbox, it hit my manager's mailbox first. How does that make any sense? The form I filled out said I would not have to contact my manager unless I was seriously being considered for the position. After my manager found out, he did whatever he could to make my job difficult and I eventually left on my own terms. Salaries are OK if you can get your manager to vouch for you. Many times folks are lowballed and get stuck at lower salaries for their level and they don't even know it. Happened to me and it happened to a few people I knew. It can be easy to negotiate upwards in these cases as long as you can show strong performance and navigate the company politically. As long as your directors are your best friends you will make great money. Promotions on the other hand are another beast. Some people I knew got promoted for no reason (other than being an SVP's best friend). As a high performer, it makes it very difficult because you work hard only to have other people get promoted because they can talk better than you, or go to more happy hours than you."

6359,4.0,"Over the last few years, bureaucracy and politics has definitely started taking over. HR is overly cautious and concerned about lawsuits so managing poor performers out of the business can be overly arduous. Also with the influx of the Oracle sales team in the last few years, the core focus of making the customer successful is getting lost in the 'just close big deals' attitude."
6360,5.0,"Some may consider on-call rotations and supporting one's systems to be downsides to an engineering position; I don't mind it, and take pride in that work. I also think being page in the middle of the night changes the way you choose tools and build systems."

6366,1.0,"They are hiring Account Executives so fast that managers are promising things that can't be delivered on (ie, Choice Accounts, Low Quota). After quitting your old job and signing on with Salesforce, all of those verbal promises go out the window. Quota isn't as discussed, and all the new Account Execs, regardless of experience get the shrapnel accounts. Salesforce.com sales management will say whatever you want to hear to get you in the door, after that all bets are off. If you come here, make sure you get your quota and territory list in the offer letter. If they are unwilling to do that, walk."

6368,5.0,Not really any cons...a good problem to have!
6369,3.0,"The technology and vision of the place is near awful. This is not a technology company. It's a sales company. They sell very well but any product no matter how pretty on the outside tend to be a hack on the inside. The engineers are not awful but they are limited and you typically do what is fastest. I would've given the rating more stars but I can't because of this major complaint. For large System affecting changes, teams may get realigned to just do it. No matter what design implications there may be."

6390,2.0,"1. You have to bear hell of politics 2. It was different when I started but now many of managers lie about promotions, bonus and green card process I think they purposefully delay so that they can retain employees. If they know you can not switch then they will give not give raise or agreed bonus as well. It happened with me. 3. Its not a technology company. There are multiple CTOs, my group CTO does not even know current technologies, they try to solve big data problems using PL/SQL and will force you to do the same even if you know Hadoop technologies or other upcoming technologies. 4. The promotion is based on number of check-ins you can make and managers openly tell that. Its absolutely not related whether you checked in test or some stupid UI / xml fix or a routine to mine billions of events to generate recommendations. How dumb management can be in technical aspect? 5. Most of the product managers and product directors are jokers, they decide future product direction and design with no technical background. They talk about topic extraction using UI and static categories. 6. Its all gonna go downhill with a burst of existing big customers leaving because product is good but page load performance sucks big time or if good technology company comes as a competitor. Its just a matter of time when it is going downhill."

6396,2.0,"While at SFDC I joined just in time to get RSUs, however, I cashed it all out when it hit $150+ and there really isn't money to be made via stock anymore. At my level they didn't do any refreshes of stock, so once you get it, that's it. At higher levels (SVP+) you could make some money, but it's like that at every other tech company in the valley. I don't have much faith in their product growth either. They have penetrated most of the market and there aren't many new logos coming down the pipeline. Most sales are with existing customers with newly acquired products. Speaking of acquisitions, the M&A strategy of buying everything in sight doesn't seem to be working that well, especially with the new senior convertible notes they are issuing. It is difficult to understand what the product roadmap is going to be like if they keep acquiring random products. Maybe Marc has some tricks up his sleeve, but it's not very clear right now. I agree with some prior comments about having to conform. When I joined several years ago, it was easy to speak your mind and get things changed, but nowadays it's all about conformity and agreeing with people. The performance process is not that good either. They go through a V2MOM process (you can find out more on the web about it) and it literally takes me an entire day to fill it out. They have changed things a bit with ""Work.com,"" but it's just that, work. IT Helpdesk is also not very good in my opinion. There is no walk-up station to get things fixed, you have to call a phone number or open a ticket, then wait until an analyst gets back to you. My first week took a couple dozen helpdesk tickets to get up to speed. There was one day my computer was on the fritz and it took literally an entire workday to get it resolved because there was no walk up station."

Each new generation of ""leadership"" is more manic and buzz-word fixated and insecure than the previous. Endless conversations about process, no productive output. No accountability for decision making. Decisions throughout the company are made privately and then imposed. Corporate holiday party spending is obscene. Everyone is a ""leader"" spending their time talking about process, very few are actually doing anything. Product has serious security flaws. Have not seen CEO on the floor in years New hires get dumber and dumber, are more and more scared of rocking the boat. Messengers are punished. Culture incents people to remain silent and go along with the head person's opinions. Basic cultural inability to use fact-based analysis to objectively evaluate performance or productivity. Managers use gossip to inform performance reviews. Management style throughout the company is very kabuki-ish. Obsessed with classist fear of being seen as touching technology. Employees spend more than 50% of their time socially managing their popularity collecting badges, recognitions and rewards in their gamified performance management system rather than doing their day job. Culture punishes people who say, ""No"", no matter the cost to the organization. Rewards go to the pacifiers, not the performers."
6407,5.0,"The workload gets intense pretty quickly Fast growth means constant org changes, The size of the company is much larger than it's ""maturity"".

6434,2.0,"Salesforce boasts a great exterior perception, but the real deal is less than glamorous. The sad thing is once you’re hired, if you do want to go elsewhere, other employers wonder what’s wrong with you because of the positive perception Salesforce has. I’ve listed several reasons why I have not recommended Salesforce to my network below. Corporate monster: The company tries to stifle employee concerns with surface-level actions like weekly team-lead meetings regarding employee worries, but nothing changes. All that happens is generic and blanket corporate messages funneled back to concerned employees. It takes years to adjust concerns about quota (ie: why is my Oklahoma quota the same as a Bay Area quota? Which, by the way, is still not resolved). Non-promotions: The company touts “rapid promotion” within the sales path, but the honest truth is that the first three to five years (ie: SR, EBR, and ESB AE) are just doormat positions with little additional salary that take longer than promised to get through. Resentment: Additionally, it is a widely known fact internally that the company hires overqualified individuals at a lower level title than they deserve. This creates a consistent stream of resentment throughout the organization. General work/life balance: For SRs (Sales Reps), our stack ranking is a joke. It leads people to act so immorally and just creates more junk for other people to deal with and waste time on. Since we are stack ranked, everyone is afraid to take a vacation since that means their numbers will be behind others that take no vacation. The department tried to alter the policy saying that reps that take at least 4 days off PTO will not have to worry about that month effecting their promotion, but does not adjust their actual quota for the month (meaning your paycheck still suffers). Lovely. Go to Box or Netsuite, or another great startup-like company that will value you. I’ve recommended other companies over the one I’m currently working for time and again. That alone should speak volumes."

6443,4.0,"Company has changed in the last 18 months. Upper management is out of touch. Each month end is like a ""quarter end"". Company has grown very fast and the infrastructure is not where it should be to support the growth, making it difficult at times to get the proper resources and support to do your job at the highest level. The tone of management has changed from a entrepreneurial do anything feel, to a restrictive and cold Oracle feel."
6444,4.0,"Frequent territory and account shifts, execs assume all prospects ""get"" the cloud, too many new products and features in beta or pilot"
6445,3.0,"Moves very slowly (only people who think 3 releases/year is fast come from even more enterprisey backgrounds) Lots of extra added process in the last year, making life harder for devs Cult worship of his highness gets old incredibly fast, especially when... ...the company hasn't actually made money in a while (using non BS accounting). This is completely inexcusable for a company with $3B+/year in revenue. If they can't generate real profits at that scale, they likely never will Most importantly, the vast majority of the R&D org doesn't really care about either their jobs or technology in general. Thats not really a problem per say (their prerogative to do so), but it wasn't really what I was looking for. I didn't interact with anyone at SFDC that I would call technically incompent, but there are far too many indifferent people and not nearly enough excellent people."

6452,4.0,"We've ignored our weak side too long: poor capacity planning, rewarding a few managers who have a 'work 'em to death"" strategy or focus on their own career to the detriment of the team, and a noticable loss of strong clear vision will become bigger problems as cloud computing matures."

6458,2.0,"The culture in marketing is dog eat dog. If you want to make a difference or actually enjoy your work, don't go to Salesforce. There is so much self aggrandizing and so many people who are fighting to rise above each other, you can't relax and just do your job. Too many people trying to do too much. It is like a sweat shop. Expectations are over the top, too. CEO thinks way too highly of himself, and it feels like he's a cult leader instead of just a good leader!!"
6459,3.0,Extremely transactional Quota is hard to attain It is a political beast
6460,4.0,"Growth means growing pains. Many people sitting in folding tables. In a sense it is a good problem to have. Hiring too many senior managers who don't do the ""worker bee"" work leaving staff to pick up their slack. High level decisions that are not collaborative which at times leaves company strategy struggling."
6461,5.0,"- You have to work! Leads to great learning opportunities and career satisfaction for the right people, but will be a con for those who want to get paid without doing the work - ""Growing pains"", as management team likes to say.

There are Re-Org's where, leadership, accounts, support, and resources ALL change. For Example: SMB, MM, and Commercial Account groups- unless you are on the high-end (New people and leadership there too) you are subject to a ""Sweat-Shop"" style of work, It never stops there...for even the most senior sales people. They push you down, to a lower level them where you are, and make you earn getting back to where you were. A lot of smoke and mirrors, there was a Re-Org and I know if at least 10 people who left SFDC because of it. They are hiring and growing way to fast. Becoming just like the company that they make fun of all the time ""Oracle"". It's become a political and very corporate ""Suit Type's"" environment. It's a good old boy's club in NYC, and the talent is not that great. (All the talent is in Field Sales, and a few in Commercial here and there) Management is really corporate, and not that talented, picks who makes it and who dosent. IE: Backgrounds from Paychex and ADP, other payment companies, I mean, come on. All follow each-other, super cut-throat, and competitive, and not in a good way."
6469,5.0,- As with any big company some politics come into play. You'll have to gain visibility to move up.

6474,4.0,"Growing too fast and loosing it's start-up culture in the process. Unless leadership pays attention fast, the culture is going to erode into a big, slow bureaucracy. Already starting to see the coolness fading where it takes too long to launch an idea. Too many approval cycles and too much politics in ""selling your idea"" versus just taking a risk, experimenting, and iterating."
6475,1.0,"Don't expect to impact the software products in a meaningful way while you are there. What you see when you get hired in terms of software coding practices is what you'll be expected to follow. And, unfortunately, there's lots of room for improvement. If you interview here, ask specific technical questions about software best practices and you're likely to get a clever ""non-answer."" A lot of nice talk about what could be done, but nothing specific that translates into actual work quality. While the Salesforce agile approach has all the ingredients a successful team can rely on, the use of those practices is whimsical. The management puts its confidence into junior employees who don't know a thing about building quality software. The middle management is useless on projects. The senior engineers are targets that get poked at ruthlessly. The website products are passable in quality, but the other products like mobile are lame. Lots of false starts and recalled releases from what I saw/heard from those teams. The product vision for the company is unrealistic and egotistical. Management professes that it wants their applications to have an ""addictive"" quality, but they don't even know how to approach that problem. I am glad I'm not there."

6486,4.0,All the success has led to a lot of account executives in the various business segments so territories are small. It can be difficult to hit your quota numbers if you do not have a blue chip territory. Those typically go to the manager's favorites... so if you don't get along with your manager the possibility of hitting your quota drops. If you work hard though you can typically succeed there.
6487,3.0,"Engineering productivity is very low. Many top-down mandates about development practices, tooling, and technology. Priority randomization among competing impossible deadlines is normal.

6491,3.0,"Besides the corporate politics you'll have to deal with and that you'll be paid significantly less than the market rate. The company has become the very thing they said they wouldn't become, they're a huge corporation now and the people outside of the top 10% of officers are only numbers to management. Don't believe in the headlines or your recruiter, at Salesforce you're nothing more than a number."
6492,5.0,Long days I’m the saddle.

For everything you notate in Salesforce and Quip be prepared to discuss with 3 levels of management on all the details several times a month in a nonproductive meeting. We don't use Salesforce the way we sell companies on using Salesforce and it shows in our meetings that could have been a Slack update. Did I mention overbooked calendar? Paid Overtime hours were taken away, but we work overtime anyway. Learning curve of Salesforce product names and jargon is never-ending. Training to AEs seems disproportionately shorter and less in depth to SEs and it impacts sales cycles."

6518,1.0,"Be prepared to have your soul sucked out from you, especially if you are affiliated in any way with Enterprise Sales in the US. It is a completely toxic environment from the top down. You will receive no support, will be constantly bullied by people who think they are the smartest in the room but have no idea how the companies they sell into actually work. Their only advice is “be strategic”, but leadership has no clue on what that even means. The group is run by politics. Run as far away from Salesforce as you possibly can if you are offered a role in enterprise, unless you want to be treated like dirt and live a completely stressed out life. It is miserable."

You'll get mental health days but that's after you've been working 9 hours a day and don't even get to log overtime for it. If you want space, you have to set it and hold to it. - Less than 30% of reps hit their quota and making money is more about lucky timing with SPIFFs than it is skill."

6531,5.0,There is constant change because Salesforce adapts to market conditions quickly.
6532,5.0,Base pay is low but you make up for it in uncapped commission - total OTE is very high but quotas are high

At the lower levels, this isn't bad, but I see what my managers and higher-ranked people on the team deal with. Especially with COVID, lots of meetings and that limits productivity. A little too ""woke"", even as a liberal (ie we're distancing ourselves from our Hawaiian/Ohana culture because it's ""cultural appropriation"") - I think conservatives have to keep that mostly under wraps (common in big tech) I've heard (haven't experienced) that promotions are somewhat political and very opaque."

6634,3.0,"Culture does not encourage employees to be authentic, instead puts pressure on everyone to have a strong “personal brand,” however as far as I saw the majority of people just adopted the same sales-y brand. Collaboration was not easy because teams were territorial and defensive. Felt like people were always watching their backs or backstabbing to get ahead (and this area in particular always scores low on the internal employee surveys). No visibility on how performance is measured and how promotions are decided. Find myself in meetings where everyone’s saying the same thing just for the sake of saying something and getting visibility. And these are the people who are rewarded. Marc Benioff is out of touch. When you keep harping on about “Ohana” but then layoff thousands of employees during a global pandemic when you’ve been reporting major YoY growth, it shows your true colors. I get it, it’s a business. But don’t pretend otherwise. It’s so fake. All this is to say that Salesforce has a very very very strong sales culture and it reflects in its employees. If you can drink the cool aid and go with it, great. But if you value authentic colleagues who genuinely value team work, trust, and collaboration - it’s going to be tough to find here."

6638,3.0,"Employee care stops at the words. If that's all you need, then jump on board; otherwise, beware that the care doesn't extend much beyond that, especially if you're not at a major hub. SFDC really likes to pump the Kool Aid down your throat, and you see the benefits of it when you look at hubs like San Fran or Indianapolis. But if you work anywhere else, beware of a constant feel of being the redheaded step child, living under the same roof, but handed only hand-me-downs and being denied dessert after every meal."

6647,5.0,No downsides as far as I can tell
6648,4.0,It was incredibly difficult to understand expectations for promotion and went through several reorganizations and managers.
6649,3.0,The Ohana thing is offensive. I am selling you my time for money and I am fine with that. Quit pretending you wouldn't fire my whole section if we stopped making money.
6650,5.0,Not many to speak of.

6654,5.0,Management are usually all over the place and a ton of restructure
6655,3.0,"The Ohana kool-aid is just bull$%@! Just like any other company they are in the business of making money and will dump any loyal employee if there is a way to increase the stock price. Watch out after any new company acquisition as the billions invested in the purchase will need to be compensated with laying off thousands of loyal employees in any region (not just USA) even when there are billions of cash in the bank. Laid off victims were given a couple of months to"" find a new position/role"" within the company except to my knowledge NOBODY I know got that coveted new position, I'm sure someone did but how many out of thousands of laid off employees... probably 1%, 3%? Oh yes, there was a high percentage of over 40-45yr old laid off employees as we all know younger employees cost less. So a lot of talk about diversity but in practice it seems there are just some categories that are considered for a diverse work force, older employees are not one of them. After you get laid off HR will become very unresponsive, YMMV. Promotion process was black magic at least to people within my unit."
6656,5.0,"- Things take some time to get done. Mainly because the company is large and we need to go through lots of bureaucratic hoops related to security, legal,etc."

6662,2.0,"Though leadership promotes mental health and taking time off between mandatory trainings, meetings and pressure to constantly work you'll never use your PTO Advice to prospective employees is get multiple people's perspectives of the company culture if that's important to you"
6663,5.0,Not many cons. Good company
6664,4.0,tough to get promoted internally
6665,4.0,Extremely large organization means work has a tendency to become compartmentalized. Your responsibilities will be much narrower than they would be at a comparatively smaller company at the same level
6666,4.0,"No cafeteria, difficult to move teams internally"
6667,4.0,"promotion is not transparent, external hires will always earn more than internal employees who dedicated their lives with the company (reason why folks boomerang)"
6668,4.0,like any other big company
6669,5.0,"None, again they’re making me post to use the site."
6670,3.0,"Very low pay for the industry. You can go to apps in the ISV ecosystem and make significantly more. How is this the case for a high growth company who continually pays for news coverage about how great of a place to work it is? Companies like Google, T-Mobile, Facebook - all give employee stock. What doesn’t Salesforce with its mega growth? 401k match is nice but lower than the average. Good boys club still exists. Females are treated differently. Leadership will never remove middle and lower managers who should be gone. Even after managers get multiple reports filed and complaints. They are still there. Product is still lacking. They spent tons of money on new products that are overpriced and basic. So we are still behind our competition."
6671,1.0,"I'm what is affectionately referred to as a ""boomerang"" (an employee who leaves and returns) and I have to say, I am incredibly disappointed in the company that I returned to. Yes, the pandemic has changed the way we do everything but honestly 95% of the company worked 90% remote before the pandemic so what I'm currently experiencing cannot possibly be as a result of the pandemic. The culture used to be people oriented where you could bring your whole self to work. You could count on a face paced environment but very clearly direction on objectives. You could expect leadership to be focused and thoughtful in their plans and direction. No more. The company still pays lip service to ""Ohana"", equality, and our values. However we have increasingly promoted really good engineers into leadership roles -- senior leadership roles to boot -- who have little idea about what it takes to be an effective leader. The company is disorganized and entirely focused on delivering everything yesterday that there is no room to focus on ""Ohana"" and taking care of the people in the process. Marc no longer is an active, visible leader in the organization. That falls mainly to Brett Taylor who seems content on turning Salesforce into Google. If I had to do it over again, I wouldn't have returned."

6678,3.0,"- seniors are unempowered: there is no real P&L, even the President/EVP of a geography does not have a real P&L. They don't have a balance sheet to manage either. All major decisions are taken in San Francisco by the same 4 people - if you are not an affirmed Democrat you are clearly excluded. I remember this mandatory fundraising diner for Hillary Clinton. Anyone not paying and going was clearly set aside afterwards - highly political at executive level: achieving results is considered obvious. What matters to progress is knowing the founder, ""culture and behavior"" and ""personal brand"" which means personal preferences, lack of meritocracy, and fierce competition to build one's ""brand"" (announce results before others, take credit for others work etc)."

6685,5.0,Ended up moving if I could stay with the company I would
6686,5.0,None that I can think of
6687,1.0,"The ""culture"" at Salesforce is extremely toxic. Everything that they do is purely lip service. Their work life balance? There is none. Diversity, do they make diverse hires? Sure, are you welcome into the office? No. How do they keep getting such great reviews? Take a look at the reviews, most of them are from employees that are 6 months or less. Right after you attend training(which is great) you are sent a survey to rate them on Glassdoor. You are on a high from training and have no idea what you have gotten yourself into yet so you give them 5 stars. Fast forward if you are an AE you are given your territory that has generated virtually no revenue from the year before or was oversold by the previous rep(you are then stuck with handling customer service issues due to poor implementation) and a number that is impossible to reach. Multiple times a week you are required to have a 1:1 with your manager to go over this territory where you are trying to make lemons into lemonade. Nepotism and favoritism runs rampant here. They allow other employees who have ""put in the work"" aka been there the longest to get the best territories and therefore they are hitting their number and eligible for promotions. The irony of this is that they are also tasked with training new employees where they have the attitude of "" pull yourself up by your bootstraps"". They are little to virtually no help because Salesforce fosters an environment where you personally have to be #1. Anything or anybody that could interfere with that is seen as a threat. I could go on about how terrible of an experience this was for me and I also recognize that this isn't everybody's experience as well. However I would be lying if I didn't cringe every time I see articles talking about their next initiative."

6716,4.0,"They preach about health/wellness, and getting a long internally, yet there are blatant discrepancies in the reality. No sick time off, just PTO. Internal teams working against each other. Lots of money goes towards marketing how great we are, when there’s not a lot changing internally."

6740,4.0,Low compensation for the current role I am in

6755,5.0,"The company was getting too big. Lots of acquisitions and not enough organic innovation as in the earlier days. Also, sometimes the culture and diversity message went over the top and became borderline propaganda."
6756,5.0,Very marketing and sales focussed
6757,4.0,"- Can be bureaucratic at times being such a highly-matrixed organization - Although innovation is a core value, company size can interfere with ability to be super nimble and agile for certain departments at times (but this not unique to Salesforce, most large companies struggle with this) - Hard work is rewarded, but you also have to be diligent about establishing your brand and getting visibility with those who have power to help advance your career. So if you are not comfortable advocating for yourself and sometimes shouting your wins from the rooftop you may not want to work here. This is very true in Marketing, perhaps not all other BUs. - While diversity is a core a value, Salesforce like most tech companies are not as diverse as they think, so something to keep in mind if you're a minority. They are, however, making HUGE priorities around DEI initiatives particularly with recruiting efforts."
6758,3.0,"over saturated territories, comp plan is not competitive"
6759,3.0,burn out quickly as the hours are long (12-16 hour days)

6762,5.0,It can sometimes feel like the golden handcuffs.

6767,4.0,"a lot of pressure, not that much flexibility on working hours."
6768,5.0,Not much to write in this slot.
6769,4.0,"1- I was surprised by how much politics are brought up, mentioned or discussed. It is very obvious the leadership has liberal/democratic believes and so do many of the employees. I personally like to avoid discussing politics so I find it really uncomfortable. 2- It’s such a big organization that it takes a while to understand how it is structured and your career path options. 3- The Management layer seems to be there to check a box and doesn’t seem to really be trained or given the tools to train and develop their team. I report to someone that does a different role than mine and every time I ask a question related to my role they refer me to a peer in my role cause they don’t know the answer."
6770,3.0,Internal politics and lack of respect for WLB
6771,3.0,Nothing really to say bad about this
6772,5.0,Politics can get in the way of a great product
6773,5.0,"Not necessarily a con, but as the company continues to grow, felt tougher and tougher to keep the notion of a family culture at its peak. I also wasn’t too fond of “Ohana” notion so I’m glad that they started dialing back on the Hawaiian references."
6774,5.0,Nothing bad to say about the company
6775,3.0,Very boring job High turnover
6776,5.0,Company structure changes very often and you need to be able to adapt to it.
6777,5.0,The pressure to perform is intense. Very high expectations
6778,5.0,"Extreme Pace of Change/Growth (actually a good thing) but be prepared to embrace and contribute to change on a daily basis. Actively drive your path in this diverse, network based organisation and you will find massive opportunity to grow."
6779,5.0,A lot of politics. Management is not great about explaining decisions made on the business. Sometimes feel like all I do is work - it can definitely take over your life.
6780,4.0,"Long shifts, overworked employees lack"
6781,4.0,"Management out of touch, insane corporate culture, non-existent career development, major layoffs."
6782,4.0,Being part of growing team means lesser growth opportunities after certain extent especially technical roles.
6783,3.0,"The pace. They seriously need to consider how they expect employees to keep going at the crazy pace. Stress and burnout at this company is concerning. Politics! Keeping 10-15 people aligned on your plan every time is exhausting. Not have the autonomy to work in the way you know you can is frustrating and due to the pace, you really only ever offer around 70%. Yet, the pace is mystifying knowing that there are so many people to do every little element of a job. Sometimes you are left wondering what you role actually is. I think some people make a career out of attending in-house ""events"". Old habits die hard and there are still (young) male sales managers that have high egos and do not treat people well - but they hit their numbers so all is forgiven. Never see head of HR at any events - yet people are so important?"
6784,5.0,Becoming a large company comes with a reduction in agility - things can be slow moving sometimes and approvals / decisions can take a while. There are some inconsistencies in things like T&E spend between departments.
6785,5.0,"numerous interviews, but i personally do not consider it as a minus"
6786,5.0,"Fast pace environment, not for everyone"
6787,5.0,"High volume of work and sometimes is difficult to have a balance between personal and professional life. Anyway this as a Sales person is a good problem to have, it shows Salesforce position in the market as well feedback and willingness of the potential customers to do business with Salesforce."
6788,5.0,can't find any till now
6789,4.0,Very numbers driven. Not as much fun in local small affiliates as in hubs.
6790,2.0,"Company has grown so much it feels it has trouble keeping up with itself. Company utilizes Google GSuite which doesn't work too smoothly with Apple or Microsoft products and hardware. You can get your work done, but if you are used to select your own tools or if you come from a Microsoft dominated environment you better be prepared for this as the impact to your productivity may be big in the beginning. The biggest problem to me has been that the Senior Management is not always on a level that I would expect them to be. There is a lot of variance in how they set the expectations, support their subordinates and especially how they present themselves as leaders. Maybe it is bad luck or maybe I'm not the right fit for the company, but this has also made me consider my options with other employers."
6791,5.0,No cantina and too many unhealthy snacks
6792,5.0,Big firm - making it slightly less personal
6793,5.0,Can be challenging understanding org structure with such a large and complex sales machine.
6794,1.0,Office is not clean many people fall sick and no one care about it
6795,5.0,Can't think of any at the moment
6796,4.0,Very few Sales people are successful
6797,2.0,"There has been no attention paid to the mid level management that was hired. Especially in the IT Project team. People leave managers, not companies. I feel I work under a manager who is straight out of the Dilbert comic strip. Numerous attempts have been made to fix my working relationship with this manager, with no results. I strongly believe that there is severe incompetence for the role and position that this manager was hired for. Gaslighting, micromanagement, plagiarising ideas, absolute disregard for an employee’s personal time. Add to this the constant reminder of the said person’s insecurities being thrown around in the garb of constantly mentioning their decade-odd years of work experience. These are just some, among the many, problematic aspects that have caused demotivation. However. I would also like to clarify that the person in question is not bad or immoral. They only happen to be a bad fit in a managerial position. This company might be ranked as the best place to work at, but from an employee’s point of view, our life revolves around the people we work with/under, daily. It is unfortunate that it has as not fared well for me. It is quite drudgeoning to constantly hear the phrases “what!!!!!”, “that is not how it works” or “i don’t understand” up until today."
6798,5.0,"Sometimes employees have an expectation that tenure equal promotion, so when it comes to evaluation time performance often hinders their journey forward, I only say this as a con as Salesforce doesn't do the greatest amount of expectation setting to create a comfortable and motivated environment. Don't make the mistake of thinking that the actual job you are doing is any different to any other inside sales role. They are a corporate company after all."
6799,5.0,Demanding work with low headcount
6800,1.0,"The India sales mgmt has a clear objective.Get your people in the company at high posts and get all the performing people out of the company. Recent exit of all the performing people is an example of what is happening. If you are hired from IBM,ORACLE,MS,SAP you are treated like a god and given special treatment in terms of higher compensation,lower targets,promotions etc without any due diligence. Many a times policies are overlooked to promote people who are dear to the mgmt. We talk about equal pay for women,however there is huge difference in how men of equal work experience for same job are being paid. Obviously hiring from our competitors is killing our Ohana culture and making the environment very toxic for anyone to grow."

6803,5.0,None even if you want to point out minor issues
6804,5.0,Can't think of any at the moment.
6805,3.0,"Unfortunately Salesforce is falling behind on how they train, promote and retain talent. It feels like it is more important to know the right people and be part of the “boys club” rather than showing success, numbers, compassion, head room and willingness to learn. Static head count rules and less flexibility around quota setting makes it frustrating to achieve numbers with impacts that are out of control of the remit of a team are. Furthermore equal pay for equal work isn’t lived through the organisation. Particularly for longterm employees who are showing loyalty and passion are being deprived in the pay scale compared to external candidates. They are being paid significantly more in the same roles as long term employees who are promoted internally."
6806,5.0,"At the same time, the culture can be overwhelming and difficult to navigate."
6807,5.0,Fast paced so difficult to keep up.
6808,5.0,Don't provide a company car
6809,2.0,Middle management are unfortunately more concerned with moving up the value chain than their customers and employees. A lot of politicking and backstabbing. No longer a meritocracy. High attrition of top performing Managers and Account Executives due to the above. Middle management out of touch with the frontline challenges. Pay is materially below the market average and competitors locally. Territories are too small for a high % of Account Executives to make money leading to high churn.
6810,2.0,"The real culture of a company, as opposed to flamboyant written statements and persistent brainwashing operations, can be judged by who stays and who leaves a company. Speedy unplanned growth will dilute any corporate culture, by the time you stop to assess the damage you realise all the good people left."
6811,5.0,"Once you're in, you'll drink the Salesforce kool aid."
6812,5.0,"No really significant cons as yet but everything seems geared towards very rapid growth. If, for some reason, the growth stalled Salesforce could be a very different place."

6834,5.0,- Still thinks it is a start-up. Some processes still immature for such a large company - Sales environment is still unhealthy in places despite best efforts. There are a few well rounded leaders. - Pace is relentless at times
6835,5.0,"- organizational setup could be better - lack of knowledge about how to get things done, since most people have only recently joined the company"
6836,5.0,Never enough resources to address the opportunity in front of us Long hours - we work hard
6837,5.0,"Not a start-up anymore! Less potential for getting what a fast growing company has to offer. If you were starting your career here 10 years ago, you would be in a great place now"
6838,5.0,- Overall process took almost 2 months - Had several interviews in the end with quite a high degree of repetition of questions
6839,5.0,A lot of politics. Management is not great about explaining decisions made on the business. Sometimes feel like all I do is work - it can definitely take over your life.
6840,5.0,It is a big company with many people. Sometimes hard to find your way through massive amount of information and people around you.
6841,2.0,"Despite not wanting to acknowledge this fact, Salesforce is an incredibly political company to progress in. There is a heavy process around advancement, the main activity being developing your own brand. This involves gaining sponsors at various levels and promoting yourself (sometimes unashamedly) heavily throughout the business. This 'brand campaigning' is by definition political. It is also biased towards those that have the time to commit to it. It is largely dependant on a full and present management chain and those who are actually fully active making a difference at their customers, or who are under resourced and performing multiple roles to serve their customer, do not get the chance to 'seize the opportunity that Salesforce states that it presents. The result is that the talent in the business feel undervalued and the promotions go to the people who have shouted the loudest. It is a real shame, Salesforce isn't the company that I wanted it to be."
6842,5.0,"Entry level positions demand a lot of work. There is a constant need to impress, and the way you present yourself is what will give you an extra push to your future role."
6843,5.0,"Company is growing rapidly, so culture could start to trend towards that 'large enterprise' feel."
6844,5.0,"At the moment i don't see particular cons except for the location, Dublin. If you like sales and you are competitive, this is the place for you"
6845,2.0,"Salesforce is huge. Where one department flourish, other can be in despair. Your manager can travel to other offices and spend 15k per trip, where you would find it difficult to get £400 conference ticket approved. Promotions are highly political and not clear. They rarely promote from within and happy to place a friend on a top position. Standard salary early rise is 3%. Bonus 10%, (not sales). Every year they overspend general expenses budget and enforce a lockdown. That affects ability to visit head office and communicate with key colleagues."
6846,5.0,Over all culture of sales engine in India deteriorating. Becoming hardcore Sales organization therefore losing core culture value. Management need to be more open to employee.
6847,1.0,"The absolute worst, hands down."
6848,5.0,Already spent too long trying to think of a con. Nothing comes to mind
6849,4.0,Release cadence of Core (3 times a year) is forced on the rest of the company even if it doesn't make sense for the product you're on. Forced to dogfood our own internal project management software (GUS) which only maintained by a very small team. Open headcount is distributed blindly to projects that are stack-ranked in priority and there's not much to go around after the top 2 or 3 start hiring.
6850,3.0,If you are a woman you will spend years trying to break through the extremely tight knit boys club. What makes it even harder is the PR about women completely contradicts the experience of many women who work here. The boys network will actively exclude women and block them as they fear they will do a better job. Mostly male leadership teams and now great women are leaving and being replaced by men.
6851,4.0,AS the company is growing in Hyderabad it would be good to groom leaders internally. Career growth seems to be limited.
6852,5.0,"As the company continues to grow, it runs the risk of becoming too operationally matrixed and too corporate in culture."
6853,3.0,"3 things have changed for me as having been with company for long time and I consider them all Cons 1. Salesforce prides itself on #ohana which is family. Salesforce #ohana is vibrabnt and alive and incredible. Unless you are in Sales in which case its non existent. It is run old school the Oracle way. 2. Customers suffer the most as they did when Sales Leadership ran Oracle. Salesforce is ruthless in scraping every penny from the client, making MSA difficult by not giving an inch on anything. Management wants the number period, if it helps the customer thats a bonus. 3. Execs get paid AE's do not. There are essentially 4 - 5 levels of Sales Management before you get to Keith Block. On the Ground Floor 7 AE's may each carry a number such as $2,000,000 US. There RVP number is not $14,000,000 but about $10 or $11,000,0000. This continues up the management change so at the highest level they will carry a quota that will significantly less the what the AE's carry. End result is Significant amount of reps will be below 50% attainment and my guess is a few percent will knock it out and may 10 to 15% actually hit their number. Opportunity to make real money like in the old days is very slim. Lot of Starving AE's which the company does not seem to mind as they make it very clear there are 10 people behind you waiting for your job."
6854,2.0,"Unattainable goals. Internal bureaucracy and fighting is worse than I've seen anywhere by far. Zero work-life balance. Expectations to take calls/respond to emails anytime of day/night 7 days a week. Only objective is to sell more to clients, not what's best for their clients. Do not live by the image they portray externally."
6855,5.0,"Its sometimes difficult to maintain work-life balance. Because the industry is fast moving, priorities can change on a short notice."
6856,5.0,"The offices are located in sandyford which is quite far from the city centre, the commute from the city centre takes around 30 minutes using the free exective bus transfers."
6857,5.0,"Could do better with career planning, especially for remote employees."
6858,5.0,High pressure environment. 1 month at Salesforce equals 6 months elsewhere. We have monthly targets which you DO NOT miss.
6859,5.0,Structure for managing multi-national accounts still needs some refinement. Free chocolate
6860,5.0,"With growth comes restructuring at times, those in sales positions that can adapt to change thrive, as roles/territories change annually."
6861,5.0,"Fast paced and can be messy at times Very strong HQ (San Francisco) centric focus Remuneration outside of sales is market competitive, but devaules the ops contribution"
6862,5.0,Does not have their office in Pune 😔
6863,3.0,"* Unless a VP you are a very small fish in a very large ocean * Unless you embrace all facets and say the right things to the right people, you are a number. * Making change is extremely hard. * Sales is the only focus. Dont be fooled otherwise. * If you are male and middle aged you wont progress. (I fully believe in gender equality)"

6867,5.0,- Growing/ scaling challenges (which is good sign) - To many stakeholders involved for decision making
6868,5.0,None. The roles I had there were always exactly what they were described to be by the hiring manager. I loved working there
6869,5.0,Can’t think of many cons
6870,3.0,"- We do not live by the rules and values we portray to the world unfortunately - Constantly hiring new sales reps, with existing sales reps having fewer and fewer accounts. - The vast majority of sales reps do not reach their quota (Its good business that they don't). - Promotions only occur for those that have a friendly relationship with senior management, if you're not in the inner circle don't waste your time. - Quarterly driven business - Senior management will always have a say and at times take full control of your deal altogether (and that's because they trust you, imagine if they didn't)."
6871,5.0,Can't think of any right now
6872,5.0,-sometimes can be to corporate with following certain procuderes etc.
6873,5.0,"The office is getting cramped as we're growing so quickly! We'll be moving to a new office in two years, though"
6874,5.0,None as of now. I'm new to the organisation so let's see if I find anything bad.
6875,5.0,the pace is very fast. it can be sometimes a bit overwhelming
6876,2.0,"Very toxic culture. The issue with Salesforce is that there are so many people lined up for working there, that they simply do not care about the long-term well-being of their employees. Salesforce is a machine, you will be put in it, use you for everything your worth, and they will spit you out and move on to the next one. Most people would say that this is what sales is like, but no, Salesforce is a beast of its own when it comes to pushing people to their limit. Furthermore, the pay really isn't that great for a sales job in tech. Maybe it was good 5 years ago? Not now, though."
6877,5.0,Is literally nothing they can do better
6878,5.0,Nothing as such. Everything was perfect
6879,5.0,- the immense growth bringt the danger of becoming a static and inflexible IT company like the other in the market. I don't see that currently happening though.

6884,5.0,Could have better training for adminscx/
6885,5.0,- Sometimes slow internal processes - A lot of overhead in the first 6 months due to compulsory certifications etc. - a lot of travelling but it's more the job itself
6886,5.0,- increasingly complex organizational structure - crowded offices in regional hubs - work-life balance is still difficult despite the company’s strong promotion of it
6887,4.0,Company has become so big there is a lower level of talent and some territories have no chance of success
6888,5.0,cant think of any cons
6889,5.0,"We are going through crazy growth in all locations and especially, Hyderabad, where will be growing from 1100 to about 3000 by 2020. Need to focus on infrastructure needs like seating etc. However, ""Growth"" is a nice problem to solve!"
6890,5.0,"- Minimum induction / orientation, everything learnt through ""Concierge""; - Super fast pace projects, short runway."
6891,5.0,Not enough diversity in leadership
6892,4.0,"The salary in Dublin isn't outstanding, given that the cost of living keep rising steadily. The company is also very leadership focused."
6893,4.0,Need more better positions in hyd office Nothing Nothing to say
6894,5.0,I don't feel any downside till now. It's great to be a part of Salesforce Ohana.

6900,3.0,Oracle 2.0 in terms of politics Many promises without any content Invisibility into management processes and decisions Generally not competitive salary within Dublin Office: - far outside the city - No assigned desk (about 5% work on the floor/ in the kitchen/ the staircase - you name it) - No canteen (two microwaves per floor) - No gym/pool etc. facilities every 6th BDR is not paid according to comp plan (you simply do not receive your commission and no replies to cases - you might get your commission 6 months later) -imbalanced territories (always the same territories on top of the dashboard on all levels) - For the DACH team: Congratulations to your recent top performing month with more than 30% of the reps hitting their target They will tell you a lot about career and progression but do not necessarily walk the talk
6901,5.0,No transportation free/paid services provided by company f
6902,5.0,"Honestly, I haven't found one yet ..."
6903,5.0,Difficult to find any :-)
6904,5.0,- Promotion revolves around interview performance instead of day to day performance - Although they try hang onto startup culture this is very difficult given the size of the company
6905,5.0,- Over-reliance on events in Marketing - Constant change can be overwhelming for some - Many products in the portfolio sometimes a challenge in marketing
6906,3.0,"- Management roles are hard to come by, sometimes they prefer to fill management role from outside just because there is no one to replace the most eligible person to be promoted - Overall promotion process has gotten slower over the years, they might say its all your abilities but it some of it is also timebound now - HIGH POSSIBILITY of crazy work schedule and long hours, especially if you are an engineer but they give you comp days, but you might never have time to redeem those"
6907,2.0,Worst criminal management carried over from its previous dimdim
6908,5.0,Being in a hub city you sometimes feel slightly less part of the team but overall no cons really...

6910,5.0,dublin office is far from city center so nothing to do near by
6911,5.0,"Keeping up with everything. Very fast paced. You can easily get lost. Required learning path, certifications and badges for your role can be tough. High pressure on getting certified starting on day 1!"
6912,5.0,Targets can be tough but this is the same with all sales jobs Sometimes it can be easier to get hired as an external than promoted internally
6913,5.0,- Can get very busy
6914,5.0,Work/Life balance is difficult at times
6915,5.0,"Recruitment, and especially communication throughout the process. I referred three people, all had good interviews, but no or limited follow-up. In one instance, the candidate didn't hear back 6 weeks after the interview."
6916,5.0,1. The non referral process is really tough 2. The opportunity in India is very less
6917,5.0,Can be extremely political at times... but that is life. For sales people pay can be a little strange.. low bases for the industry but everyone brags about earning ridiculous amounts of cash.
6918,5.0,Salesforce is constantly recognized as one of best employers in the world and I can't think of anything that needs to be improved.

6927,5.0,"Little to none! Pay could be slightly better, but this is more so because you can demand a great income at other businesses based on a couple years of awesome experience at Salesforce."
6928,5.0,Over all culture of sales engine in India deteriorating. Becoming hardcore Sales organization therefore losing core culture value. Management need to be more open to employee.
6929,5.0,"- work/personal life balance: you need to be always on, even during vacation/outside of regular business hours - multiple acquisitions of other companies often requires modifying internal processes and structure (every fiscal year org structure seems to change - this may be a good or bad thing depending on your point of view)"
6930,5.0,- Still lots of tribal knowledge and a few duplicate systems - Who you know is very important to your overall experience and success
6931,5.0,- Downsides of extreme growth. Hard to keep up with new products. Hard to onboard all the new colleagues
6932,5.0,No office transport and food can be better
6933,4.0,strong sales focus across teams and roles
6934,4.0,High pressure no work life balance
6935,5.0,Lots of internal politics. Avoid Sales Cloud if you can.
6936,5.0,- Increasing lack of transparency from upper management. - Growth having a negative affect on standards and culture. - Recent introduction of hot desking has turned the office into an impersonal and unwelcoming place to be. It's cost savings at the expense of employees interests. - Uncertainty over future unified office location in Dublin.
6937,3.0,"1. If you're hired as ""Success Agent Tier-2"" for CRM support then your Salesforce career is over because you'll be working in a specific skill group (Configuration, Usage or Email team) and do not get any chance to explore the real Salesforce CRM tool. 2. Management do not to monitor/plan their employees leaves(PTO's) properly which again makes very difficult to work with a huge backlog of cases. You can expect 25-30 cases per agent in AMER shift or 30-35 cases per agent in EMEA shift. NOTE: I have worked in Wipro (worst of all IT companies) so I am very well aware of overload/ extra amount of work. 3. They do not have enough ""Tier-3"" resource which makes your life miserable because as Tier-2, you'll be the only point of contact for the customer who has raised a case. If customer escalates the case or gives you DSAT due to the delay in resolution, then it won't affect Tier-3's performance. Management will simply blame you. 4. So many bugs/ Known issues in every major releases which will make you cry like hell as a support agent. 5. If you ask CSG management to hire more resources to reduce the back log, they'll simply say - ""No we cannot because we do not have enough budget"". 6. HR team sends out an employee survey link in each quarter but that doesn't make any change in your work life. 7. Also when it comes to ""Employee referral""(if your friends, relatives or siblings gets hired then you get $2000/each) program in Hyderabad is one of the most ""Corrupted"" program they've. I have seen 3 examples of corruption in referrals where managers referred their siblings who has really good terms with the ""hiring manager"". They all got selected and each manager earned easy $2000 + Family member (as a salesforce employee). So again if you're hired as Success agent Tier-2 then forget about referring anyone. 8. No way you will get Onsite chance. Strict policy. Also please do not dream of getting free passes/visit to Dreamforce event especially if you're in India. ()"
6938,5.0,- Overall process took almost 2 months - Had several interviews in the end with quite a high degree of repetition of questions
6939,3.0,"no management, no team spirit, no real strategy on sales patch and target distribution, carreer process for sales is all about network..."
6940,5.0,- Depending on team promotion might not be as quick as with other tech companies - Compensation slightly below some competitors
6941,5.0,* As mentioned the learning curve is steep. It can become overwhelming at times in terms of learning the products but also trying to perfect your sales technique. The support structures are there but if you are previously unexperienced in tech sales (like i was) there will be days when you feel a lot of pressure.
6942,5.0,"Nothing much, too rapid growth"
6943,5.0,Nothing much I can say here
6944,4.0,Burnout culture - high growth targets at any cost Claims to be customer-centric company but in many ways is not Aggressive sales culture. Under resourced on Customer success and employee engagement
6945,2.0,"The real culture of a company, as opposed to flamboyant written statements and persistent brainwashing operations, can be judged by who stays and who leaves a company. Speedy unplanned growth will dilute any corporate culture, by the time you stop to assess the damage you realise all the good people left."
6946,5.0,"Hard to affect change and drive product direction that is meaningful to the market as opposed to the ""cool"" flavor of the month being driven from the top down."
6947,2.0,Sales people treated as a disposable resource now. Too many sales people with unrealistic numbers for the market. Very few people hit their quota. They'll attract you with a big OTE but you won't make it. This place is now Oracle 2.0 - there are much better cooler companies ot work for now who treat sales people really well.
6948,5.0,-Sometimes can get stuck waiting for headcount for promotions leading some to switch to external and then jump back in at a higher role -At times may need to battle internal politics
6949,5.0,"Honestly, so far there is no ""con"" I can imagine."

6956,3.0,"- Marc Benioff (CEO) hasn’t been to the EMEA HQ in Dublin in over 5 years. Take from this what you will. - lack of transparency with internal interviews, no ACTUAL reason for not being promoted. The provide feedback through the medium on nonsensical corporate jargon that ultimately yields no explanation as to what you did wrong or how to improve going forward. - Dublin office location is in an industrial estate near the Dublin mountains"
6957,3.0,"It can be a very competitive environment, not necessarily in a positive way. Naturally, as the company grows it becomes less able to hold onto the small-startup culture that it once had. If you fit in, you fit in well but if not it can be a lonely place to be. Work-life balance is very much a work-in-progress."
6958,5.0,"- We work hard, so you need to be aware and appreciate this"
6959,3.0,"- Less concern for individual contributors. - Partner management sucks. - Almost $0 for Marketing Events in this region (Greater China) - Many people enjoy sucking up to the management, cos it works all the time."

6969,5.0,Internal Politics There are no cons other than that in last 1.5 years that I know
6970,4.0,"- Demanding customers and sometimes high-stress assignments - Good amount of travel required (can be good if you want to travel a lot) - Bonus/variable payouts done through complex calculation - sometimes engagement lose sight of the best possible technical solution and can be less satisfying for techies - KPIs and measures based on $-value and customer feedback and less on quality of design - Project delivery management not as strong as sales and misses common management tools/templates - Prince, PMP, etc."
6971,3.0,"In Salesforce, it can be quite difficult navigating the direction that you would like to take in your career. In my experience, it's been mostly a minefield when it comes to career advice. It all depends on your manager."
6972,4.0,very hard work and a lot of stress
6973,5.0,no cons at all what so ever
6974,2.0,I joined this company with great aspiration and my dream shattered within a couple of weeks. From Managers to Upper Management in AMER shift in India craves for CSAT ...they push engineers to pitch surveys... total breach with customer ethics and core values of salesforce. Support Agent is like a survey machine nothing more than that...in fact the team never cares about the learning and enhancing the skills of Engineers. Rather find a way to get the good survey. I left the company in frustration due to these malpractices and learning curve was zero.
6975,5.0,Nothing to say - had a great time there :)
6976,5.0,long hours and fast moving pace so business constantly changing (not necc a bad thing)

6982,5.0,I haven't come across any cons so far.
6983,5.0,"- Like all the big companies, there is a complexity in some internal processes (but less than others where I've been in the past) - Many products means many teams organized in different ways, not that easy to understand - Variable pay is based on different metrics and some times is hard to calculate/predict"
6984,5.0,"as we grow, sometimes there are too much organizational complexity"
6985,5.0,Challenging environment (this could be thought as a Pro either)

6993,5.0,"Growing quickly, hard to keep up!"
6994,1.0,"I have seen many reviews but no action yet. We only see the canned response. Biggest mistake by getting employees and management from Call centre culture. 2. Spoiled the work culture. Most of them doesn’t have knowledge or attitude to work in company like Salesforce. They are fit for BPO only. Salesforce values now changed from Trust to No-Trust. Now the culture is Politics, backstabbing, data manipulation. There was saying Getting into Salesforce is harder than getting into Harvard university. This doesn’t apply for Hyd CSG. Criteria for hyd CSG:- 1. Referred by Management 2. Wife can refer husband and vice-versa. True ohana can be seen here. Husband and wife working in same team, shift, and manager. Though we have policy around it, who cares need to focus on Ohana. If not in same team it’s very easy to work in same shift. Doesn’t make sense reaching out to ES as they are the one who gives offer letters. Promotion criteria:- management favourite. Need to know how to play politics. Backstabbing and how to get numbers. Management is afraid to take actions against non performers and people with wrong attitudes which actually spoiled the entire culture. list will go on..."
6995,5.0,I am yet to come across a con
6996,5.0,At the moment I can not find any Cons
6997,2.0,"Salesforce software not as great as the company leadership thinks it is and recent product integrations have made some of the product suite confusing and unnecessarily complicated - IMV there is significant potential for an innovative start-up to steal large chunks of their customer base; Recent revenue growth appears to be mostly based on milking existing customers - not a lot of market share left to acquire - future growth will need to come from moving into new lines of business through more acquisitions. This in turn will lead to continued and increasing integration challenges and internal company friction; Biggest internal issue I see is that the 'Ohana' culture is leading to employees being too comfortable in their way of doing things and not striving enough for improvement. Combined with this, many managers have lulled themselves into following simplistic metrics and KPIs without understanding the underlying basis for the measurements, nor whether or not they are actually fit for purpose. Arising from this cultural laziness, leadership simply do not have the courage to challenge the status quo and drive the changes needed to improve the company's performance. The technology teams also need to do a better job dealing with the technical debt accumulated from acquiring companies whose technology stack was thrown together with little or no design review"
6998,2.0,"The ""best place to work for"" and ""ohana culture"" may be true for other countries or departments, but a big lie in Singapore Sales Development team. The management team is unreasonbale and sometimes even rude. The worst part is the politics. Because of that, more team members spend most of their time making their managers and director happy so that they can steal other people's effort instead of working on their own without being penalized."
6999,1.0,"Don’t get all too bubbly with what you see in public about this company with their philanthropic model of giving back and rising stocks because behind closed doors it has to be one of the worst experiences as a sales professional. 1. I don’t think SF thought about the Exact Target and Pardot acquisitions because it created a lot of issues such as internal conflict between Exact Target and Pardot reps over the right solution for an interested customer, 2. Salesforce Account Execs having to put quota relief size over the right solution and with Pardot the smaller investment price tag over its Exact Target meant you would lose out pretty much all of the time. 3. The quotas in the upper customer segments were not aligned to the sales cycles and instead geared towards the SMB segments. 4. Little empathy from the local leadership who were well aware of these challenges and instead ignore the issue as the revenue seemed to be the only concern. There is a reason why there is a high churn it nobody there seems to care. Was once commented that the sales recruitment process is like an “assembly-based manufacturing plant” in that reps go out as much as they go in and that at the end of the day “nobody cares”"
7000,4.0,- Not the most interesting work
7001,5.0,"- Since company is growing fast in Hyderabad, there is space contention. The leadership could have planned the office space per growth plan. SF Hyderabad office has already full and they are still hiring. - Onboarding can be little better."

Senior management says something and middle mangement does totally opposite * Not compassionate or empathetic. * Poor Employee Success(They should be named as Employer Success) * Talks lot about Ohana, literally everywhere. But it doesn't come in practice. * Says lot about stakeholders. As an important stakeholder, an employee never been valued * Never expect job security. * Poor management decisions with business and no collective thoughts. * Female employees never valued as much as male. Never hired any female employees in most of the organizations. Mostly male dominated organizations. * Lots of serveys happens, but no action will be taken to correct things."
7013,4.0,continued territory splitting and quota increases - makes longevity tricky
7014,5.0,As Salesforce is growing at a fast rate and now over 30.000 people you will encounter and have to manage internal politics to get things done for your customers. However compared to other big corporate IT companies this is still a breeze for me.

7030,5.0,No cons as of yet
7031,5.0,"These are more Heroku issues than Salesforce issues. We were (and still are) strapped for headcount over many years. This leads to serious team health issues and burnout. Exec is keenly aware of the issue and taking steps to fix it, but it should never have gotten this bad. At the moment, our product org is also sorely understaffed following turnover and departures, which means that many engineering teams don't have anyone to help them make sound product choices. We get by, but the product roles are critical, and the product managers we have are spread way too thin. As above, our exec team is aware of the problem and trying to hire as fast as they can. These are short- to medium-term issues. I believe they'll get worked out and we'll have smoother sailing in a few months. Longer term, my larger concern is complacency. I don't know if Heroku/Salesforce has the gumption to make the big bets to really grow our business and remain relevant for the next epoch. For the last decade we've made it drastically simpler to run compute workloads in the cloud, and it's built a large and successful business. With containerization catching on and tooling becoming more mature, we're being commoditized. I don't know that exec has the appetite to determine what the next ""git push heroku master"" is, and allocate enough resources to pursue it. That feels like an existential threat."
7032,3.0,"While Salesforce touts its 'Ohana', being in a company that size means that you do feel like a number sometimes rather than a person. Can be a very intense place to work. While they do promote work-life balance, the amount of work you have on your plate means that you're working long hours and weekends a lot of the time."
7033,4.0,Lack of transparency when discussing career path
7034,5.0,lots of processes to learn
7035,5.0,"Pace - Salesforce moves at speed, juggling multiple elements all at once"
7036,5.0,Sometimes lack of resources and basic infrastructure / processes.

7038,1.0,"* employees are not valued I was offered a full time position (6 months in advance before the start date) after having completed a 4 months internship but they ended the contract 2 weeks before starting as they decided to relocate the team to another country. Because of that, I need to mention they ended the contract of other 20 people the were working in the team. (all had to look for a new job) They only offered 1 month salary as compensation nothing more. I have already paid for a new accommodation where I was a guarantor for other 2 people. I brought proof. They didn't care. And this is how people end up in the streets (unless you can find a job in one week or own some savings) So much of the OHANA spirit they are so proud of!"
7039,5.0,"For some roles, the performance bonus is based on billed time over the year, so ""bench"" time as consultant does not help much to reach 100% performance even if the effective work was good for the client."

7047,5.0,Nothing I could think of.
7048,5.0,I don't have any cons to mention up to now
7049,5.0,Rapid growth means constant change - some may struggle with this. Internal systems struggle somewhat to keep up with the growth and constant innovation - we should be drinking our own champagne. The larger we grow the more careful we have to be about preserving our unique culture - this needs to be managed top down and newly hired leaders need to be on board.
7050,1.0,"- Lack of Transparency in every thing, whether it is promotion, interviews, work etc. Promo - Collect feedback from your favourite people and get promoted to VP even if your sub ordinates or people working under you don't like your style of functioning. Just like typical Indian govt. office promo's where you throw money here you throw feedbacks. Interviews - Whom to hire for the position, what qualities to look for, what job responsibilities should be conveyed, no clarity. Hire and attract talent by throwing industry buzzwords like etc. containers, docker, kubernetes, etc and tell them to work on round the clock patching or deployment work. (No forum to raise this concern apart from glassdoor) - No clear vision from senior/mid senior management/infra leadership. People at bottom most level who don't know what they are supposed to be delivering in infra. Software engineers working on operations work to resolve switch issues and fixing racks, working with DC engineers. They don't have any clarity or vision of future from leadership. (No forum to raise this concern apart from glassdoor) - How to get all star award? Well there are lot of ways to achieve it: 1) Sit in US HQ office and screw things in production time and time again and get a all star award. If you do the same from Hyderabad then you will land into PIP (Performance improvement program). 2) Create a half baked software or an automation working in silo without taking any requirements from actual endusers. Create a hype around it, push it to prod with no proper testing, provide zero documentation, get stocks/promo's/all stars and then move out of the project to screw something else. - No alignment Work for some other team and report to someone else in the management chain who has no idea what are you doing. V2MoM of folks in hyderabad is more of marketing gimmick it fails to provide any alignment, clarity or vision for people working at the ground level. When you are asked to talk about it no ones know how to get it sorted, they just want to keep doing things the way they are because end of the day they are more concerned about there own promo's. (No forum to raise this concern apart from glassdoor)"

There are so many things, in short Director is psycho and wants to control everything, he shows things differently to Tod(manipulates content)."
7075,4.0,"1. Poor onboarding of new employees. Esp. if you are part of a team that doesn't have a presence in Hyderabad or your Boss sits in a different office. 2. The recruitment team is not friendly/professional during the hiring process. The hiring process took almost 10 weeks and I had to call at least 10 - 15 times to remind them to release the offer (even the hiring manager confirmed I have been hired) 3. Information overflow (very poor signal to noise ratio). Sometimes you will be amazed at so many emails/chatter flying around you and you don't know what to do abou it. 4. The Employee Success Team (HR) needs to pull their socks up. As a new employee, I had faced several problems in the early days. I asked for help, but they were never there. It felt they just don't care."

Treat sales people like dispensable soldiers, hire 100, lose 50 hire another 100 - people arrive and just disappear a few months later, some only last a few months.

No technical manager/leader/boss in India. Flattery always works like a charm with the leaders. Team do not follow ""no gift policy"". Leaders of this team love to take expensive gifts from the team members. You can enjoy lunch for hours and hours if you are with mangers of this team. Very strict rules for office timing (9:30 you reach office or you better be prepared for the day). Though this rule is not applicable for leaders of this team. Mangers/Leaders put lot of pressure to get 5 out of 5 star from the clients you are working with. You will learn the high politics in very early age of career"
7090,2.0,some redundant teams just float around.
7091,1.0,Unrealistic sales targets and only 30% of very experienced Account Executives actually make commission. High turnover of sales people due to this. Very junior inside sales team (BDRs) to help you prospect and drive customer facing activities. Also lack of support from marketing in a new sales territory for Salesforce. Salesforce state #dreamjob in the market place but that is not the case at all in sales unless you are given a good territory.

7101,5.0,- Can sometimes feel like a bit of a corporate giant
7102,5.0,Nothing is perfect but the tiny tweeks required are happening in real time to try and make the life here as enjoyable and productive as possible. Salesforce don't actually have the cleanest use of the Salesforce app! More app rigour could help with account team changeovers as there is a loss of info when teams swap. The sales commission on very big deals is heavily reduced
7103,2.0,"Too many politics in the local region and revenue-only focus. And HQ is not interested in a non-US region. A power harassment by a local none-sales executive(such as VP level of Mktg, HR, Finance, Strategy)occurs and lies neglected."
7104,3.0,Hybrid development goals and training were not well thought out.

7107,5.0,My good lock in your
7108,5.0,"- Hours are long, especially at the end of quarters, occasional weekend required - Occasionally too politically correct - Very sales team focused, all other areas can be made to feel like you are 2nd best to them - Split offices mean that most events and senior management locate themselves in one. As based in the other it can lead to a distant feeling. - My team don't do many events or socialising outside the office, but many others do"
7109,5.0,There are now cons working at Salesforce
7110,5.0,"The job is not very challenging, but is temporary however - you get the chance to get to know your network and company better in the meantime. The salary is quite low. Office situated in Sandyford instead of city center."
7111,5.0,high pressure results driven environment. Salesforce isnt the fastest growing software company by accident
7112,5.0,None.. but the initial technical certification process was initially a shock to the system.
7113,3.0,"If you're looking to work in a 'start up' environment then this isn't for you. Very corporate, similar to a bank."
7114,5.0,"As the company continues to grow, it runs the risk of becoming too operationally matrixed and too corporate in culture."
7115,5.0,None at the moment - great place to work.
7116,4.0,"Bureaucracy, very political"
7117,2.0,"Salesforce is huge. Where one department flourish, other can be in despair. Your manager can travel to other offices and spend 15k per trip, where you would find it difficult to get £400 conference ticket approved. Promotions are highly political and not clear. They rarely promote from within and happy to place a friend on a top position. Standard salary early rise is 3%. Bonus 10%, (not sales). Every year they overspend general expenses budget and enforce a lockdown. That affects ability to visit head office and communicate with key colleagues."
7118,5.0,Work life balance and benefits could be more agressive

7120,5.0,Pressure for growth if anything is immense
7121,3.0,"Work life balance is a real challenge, it's a high pressure environment, very demanding, always-on, real-time reactions expected on everything. Failure is not an option. Salary is good, but the rest of the benefits are weak versus other big software companies. On-boarding for new hires (if no direct experience in selling CRM/Salesforce) is very challenging, steep learning curve."
7122,4.0,None what so ever in mind

7134,1.0,"Disgusting management with cheap political views. Can clearly see how the verification and background process works, anyone with Even fake experience and Fake degrees can obtain a job in support, Can clearly see them getting promoted and management applauds them for holding fake certificates. There is a Term Ohana seems like HYD management cannot even adapt to it, and its a SHAME they they lie saying we follow OHANA. Being a parent company management is absolutely scared of Management from centers outside of india. Its not the HYD management who controls the center, but rather other geographical centers. Favoritism by managers to promote and grow a person, who does not even fit the role and infact an unworthy candidate for the position."

7143,5.0,In my six months I do not have any cons to the company.
7144,5.0,No Cons as of now. Salesforce is a very aggressive company when it comes to promoting their brand value and there might be high pressure on employees to deliver their best.
7145,5.0,Does not have their office in Pune 😔

7151,1.0,"- A lot of brainwashing. All you hear and see in the office is them being the #1 at everything they do. At some point, I am wondering if employees really feel happy or if it is just because the rankings are saying so. Please note that you also have to learn by heart a presentation in order to be able to anyone how great SF is. - HR is not mature in Europe. It is quite concerning to not have direct HR support for each country and that you need to log a ticket on their intranet platform. A real person would be nice to have to discuss real/ important life matter - If you don't work in Sales you might not really feel considered by the company. - Getting very corporate and political..

7165,5.0,Management and people who were assigned to be managers but have no business to manage people.
7166,4.0,Team Manager are sometimes not a fit for the role - don't understand the market they're managing or speak the language of the country they're managing. On the outside they are living the Ohana culture but on the inside there is not always Ohana. When working in sales for example there is a lo of pressure and too many changes for different processes. Not everybody get's a chance to work here. For example if you have 7 years of working experience in sales but no university degree then you don't get a chance for an interview. This is not right!
7167,5.0,Having to regurgitate the company values on a regular basis

7171,5.0,It is a very fast paced company - things and organization is often changing and can seem a bit chaotic at times Tough targets to reach
7172,5.0,"How to top this company in the future, when looking for next career move. Also not all employees are sent to San Fran for bootcamp, which is a shame. Was blamed on budget and not ""required"" for role. Where I have seen other new starters who are in similar roles going to San Fran. I have already witnessed some confusion in the direction we going in, where the Senior Management are making all the decisions and not consulting how the wider teams feel about changes, or their opinions.

7181,3.0,"- Dublin office feels like a neglected outpost (Hint: The CEO has never visited this office in the past 5 years!)

7206,5.0,Work/Life balance is difficult at times
7207,5.0,Growth at this scale is a challenge in terms of org structure and career development. The company is addressing these while steaming ahead with growth. This inevitably will not lead to a perfect solution but that is the whole part of being in a growth business.

7230,5.0,"The agile and lean teams mean we do a lot of work. Quite often the focus is on solving burning issues (and there are a lot of them!) instead of focusing on the fundamental operations, which doesn't leave us much time to fix things and make them better. I also struggle to understand why it's so hard to get licences for our own products to use internally. Also, not enough clarity around development and career guidance, that's left all up to you."

7250,5.0,Organization and structures not always keep pace with the growth of the company.
7251,5.0,"The organisation is based on open collaboration and it could be difficult at time to adjust and frustrating when only few colleagues play the game honestly, but that's human and everyone has their priorities which could be difficult to balance at times."
7252,2.0,"Salary increases and promotions are restricted to the 'boys club'. The Ohana culture is well touted internally and externally, but the reality is that the focus is purely on growth and sales with little concern for employees ZERO work/life balance, I've now heard that we should be considering work/life integration instead! Sales people count has grown exponentially, however the sales support functions have not, therefore there is a very limited pool of support resources. Expect 12-16 hour days if in sales. Be ready to drink from a fire hose when it comes to information overload No real structure Becoming a 'revolving door' company with account executives"
7253,5.0,"No cons, It's the best place to work!"
7254,5.0,None experienced in my role
7255,5.0,"Monthly targets which can be stressful unless you are overachieving. Success can be highly determined by your territory and segment. With significant growth comes significant headcount increases which means smaller territories regardless of quotas being raised. Salaries seem lower than industry average, although there is no cap on commission so you have the opportunity to make a ton of money if you are in the right patch. With all large corporates come lots of politics. Play the game and build your brand early otherwise you will be limited in your opportunities. Entering into unchartered waters for many leaders in the business with this massive growth phase hitting $10B+ and seem to be emphasising how important it is to mirror large companies such as Oracle if we want to get to $20B+. Seem to be hiring a lot of ex-Oracle executives. With that, I slowly watch the culture shift every month...Not in a good way."

7263,1.0,9All the policies are not implemented strictly example Dream force and New Hire orientation(boot camp) especially in India (because of budget). Lot of Local Management in India and lot of internal politics
7264,1.0,"1. Horrible management and lack of leadership and responsibility 2. Salesforce Hyd R&D does not hold the title well since most of the work is service based. 3. The R&D management does not offer growth, leaders of this group are very impatient and rude. Not worth being in good books. No respect given to peer’s and sub-ordinates, R&D management is only concerned about its own position and growth. 4. The management in Hyd office will claim that Salesforce among the best companies to work for - this is true but only applies to the US head office, certainly does not apply to Hyd office. 5. Don't be surprised that young employees working in this company for quiet some time can be political and very influential. 6. The maturity in most employees is below par. They have only one thought in mind, how to grow and get more money no matter if they have to step over there own colleague. 7. Work life balance is bad in some teams. Expectation is you will have to slog and meet the deadlines. If you don't then you need to look elsewhere. 8. Salesforce Hyd has always been on the HQ's radar in terms of quality of work and deliveries. Unfortunately the situation is not good. 9. Quality of work is ridiculously below par. People don't care if the code is messed up, all that is important is releasing the product with the proposed feature. 10. In some teams, employees argue and embarrass each other with respect to deliveries. They don’t care about one’s self respect, no respect for other colleague, finger pointing is a very common phenomenon. 11. Feedback sickness - management will constantly take feedback from diff employees working in your team, if anyone gives wrong feedback; that will not be communicated back to you, instead it will be used against u. 12. Employees in most teams are impatient and hungry for growth. Verdict – Employees in this company have low self-respect and self-esteem."
7265,4.0,"Too much middle management, and false titles. Company vision and direction are constantly changing. Some promotions are caused by political reasons, rather than having the best candidate for the job selected."

7267,5.0,Ability to work under pressure
7268,1.0,Where do I start . The only management in the Dublin office is a disgrace to salesforce and PARDOT. horrible person who rules with fear and causes more problems for everybody in PARDOT. But is protected from higher management. Over the last 2 years 70% of PARDOT employees quit and yet the company and management do nothing .
7269,5.0,Have to leave at some point
7270,5.0,Some management team not good.
7271,2.0,"-Culture is shifting away from employee and customer first to growth targets first -New processes are added my management every month. -All autonomy and self-governance has been taken away -Becoming more like a call centre than true strategic business development -Management has clearly become detached from the realities of the job their direct reports are doing -Morale and any emphasis on fun has all but disappeared -Only company I know where if you promote to Account Executive, you can often end up earning less money due to terrible commission structure for closed business."

7274,4.0,"Very sale-led culture, many stakeholders to manage"
7275,4.0,"Some internal politics at higher levels made for useless and time-wasting discussions around KPIs that did not matter for the company overall, such as 'call connects' (quality of calls) or which AE got to write the opportunity to his/her name (due to country differences). Weird, since in the end we all work to move the same company forward. Also, we were quite clearly promised promotion within max 14 months. This is now 18 months due to lack of open positions."
7276,2.0,1) Mangers openly show disregard for culture and operate independently with limited checks. They have openly disregarded VTO activity as a waste of time. 2) They have too much control in hiring and with no systems in place will hire people they know and be discriminatory towards people who might be more talented. 3)There is not scope of work-life balance for employees in this particular team in T&P. Manager outrightly denies any request to work from home and expects all employees to be caged at their workplace

7294,5.0,"- very HQ and Sales centric company. Opportunities for advancement beyond Director usually require you to move to San Francisco, if you aren't in sales. - like any company with global teams, you often find yourself working very long and odd hours."
7295,5.0,Salaries are slightly better in other companies.
7296,5.0,"It's a work hard, play hard culture, and we move fast, so if you aren't ready/willing to put in the inputs, it might not be the right sales job for you."

7309,5.0,"Control from HQ, needs to decentralise."
7310,4.0,It is a large company so sometimes there are lots of hierarchy's and it may take longer to get into a management role. If you prefer smaller tech startups then it may not be the place for you.
7311,4.0,"-go get promoted, it is very challenging for working moms and parents in general to have a good work life balance -too much self promotion needed to get promoted vs looking at people's actual work because of Salesforce's culture"

7315,5.0,"If you don't maintain boundaries, it would be easy to drown under the workload. It can be hard to prioritize and the pace of change is so rapid, it can be hard to keep up. There's a strong focus on W-L balance, but sometimes it feels like lip service."
7316,4.0,-Can be hard to manage work life balance at times based on quota attainment
7317,1.0,"-Fellow sales people act like children -Very pompous attitude of most people that work there -backstabbing mentality -your success there is defined by your patch -lots of internal politics and sucking up involved -Very deceiving to customers, will say anything and do anything to get the deal done. Testament to that is the insane amount of customer satisfaction issues you have to deal with while there"

7325,5.0,Maybe growing to be and losing it's start up culture.
7326,4.0,- Promotions are not transparent (Switzerland offices) - There are not many young employees to create a more dynamic working environment (Switzerland offices)
7327,3.0,"- Despite what is promised repeatedly, there is no real possibility to change department when you're in a career path, especially in sales. - Very high pressure and targets in Sales - CONSTANTLY monitored: Salesforce is the leader in cloud CRM and knows very well how to use its tools to control its employees every single activity and everyday actions, can be quite annoying at times - Uneven between markets: mature markets have a very easy life compared to less matured markets (in monthly targets, promotion criteria, visibility within company, etc.)"
7328,5.0,Is less easy to achieve annual quota
7329,3.0,"- Mid-Management have prominently been promoted through the business from the Dublin SMB hub, and therefore lack basic management skills, and typically are more concerned about managing up and their careers over yours. - Very little internal personal or professional development. - Each Sales team does their own things (Forecasts/meetings, etc), with very little synergy or combined learning. Which has fostered a very ugly competitive and back-handed culture - with lack of trust a core problem throughout the UK, especially when dealing with US colleagues. - Lots of very talented people, from all aspects, Marketing, Product, and Sales have left the business, with their replacements (typically Graduates) lacking the basic skills."

7340,5.0,"really fast pace, long or unusual work hours due to high demands on the business"
7341,1.0,"It's with a heavy heart and reluctance that I share my review. Salesforce is an amazing company, however, within the department I work there is an overriding culture of insidious bullying, throwing people under the bus, lack of support, openness, coaching and development. Promotions are based not on your ability but for political reasons and whether your face fits, especially if you are able to 'toe the party line' and do not step out of line with the department head. This environment has been created and sustained over the last few years based on fear; if you are good at your job and have a point of view, no matter how professionally you express it you know your time is limited. The final result? A department which is wouldn't look out of place in North Korea, you would state black is white just to keep your job. It really is that bad. The worst of it is that this is known about at a very senior level and for some time and yet nothing is done to remove the perpetrator from the organisation. For fear of retribution I dare not share any further details, suffice to say that it's non-sales, and it's a department which should be the gold standard for promoting the Aloha culture. I'll leave it at that."

7343,3.0,- overall structure and strategy not visible - no teamwork from Management to employees in stressful times - very long response time from management - flaky decision making - no decision making possible from the team. Management always wants to decide everything

7355,4.0,- were not well equiped at that point to compete against MSFT - very individual culture
7356,3.0,"Very little interaction between business units makes for 'villages' in the main office. Lots of pressure on sales roles. More focus on sales than technology. Not being 'customer first'. Not a clear career progression path. Seemed to be much more about who you know than acting as a meritocracy. More effort should be put into making Salesforce a great place to work than there is making Salesforce *look like* a great place to work. Glossy brochures don't make up for the fact that you can't view payslips online. But the single worst part of working for Salesforce is the lack of an engaged HR department. So-called ""Employee Success"" are distant, hard to reach and ultimately unhelpful. From out of date processes (including faxes!) to archaic procedures and the simple fact that they don't engage on Chatter (the company's primary collaboration tool) at all. They hide behind group emails and a poorly implemented ticketing system."
7357,5.0,"Salary, we agreed on moving forward with the conditions but I think it's important to offer people a competitive offer of what they have in their actual job. Money is not the most important thing but it is important."
7358,5.0,"Many phone calls, tough preparation for the presentation."
7359,4.0,Less career opportunities in brazil. It should have more oportunities to outside peopple.
7360,4.0,"No clear company direction. Strategy and long term vision are kept to the senior management and tech visionaries. The rest of the company just has to learn and get up to speed after technology/products are launched. Salesforce is a sales company, not enough emphasis or attention goes to Support/Services."

7371,5.0,Salesforce is a huge company and it can be difficult to navigate responsibilities
7372,1.0,"This review has one star only because Salesforce on one hand celebrates Ohana as its #1 value but on the other hand it tolerates bullying Bad managers who burn people, create chaos, amplify pressure, ignore feedback on issues, do not challenge upwards, do not ensure their teams are set up for success but when things do not go to plan they resort to scapegoating and bullying. HR take side with the company and effectively protect bullies Formal grievance process is ineffective and useless Bullies/""high performers"" get promoted and awarded for their behaviors Delicate situations handled by HR contractors who come and go No one senior from HR gets directly involved"
7373,5.0,"Honestly, I just can't think of anything"
7374,5.0,Not Applicable Seriously. Don't want to search for one.

7390,3.0,"Marketing marketing marketing. The company endlessly trumpets its supposed wonderfulness to the point where it feels like working in an endless commercial. There seems to be a huge push to constantly market the company both externally *and* internally; having the 'culture' shoved down our throats constantly. The company seems to spend an awful lot of money on fluffy extras (like pillows for all employees to put their mobile phones on at their desks, and professionally produced promotional videos for internal-only items) whilst asking employees not to use Roaming Data whilst abroad on business, and only allowing VPs to fly comfortably (some are more equal than others in this Ohana). PR touts Salesforce as a cutting edge company, but back-office systems are ancient and technology stacks are not integrated after years - there is a big disconnect between PR and reality, but the 'Ohana' papers over the cracks.

You either step up or leave during probation. If you do step up, you will reach your limit, then be overloaded again. If you're a workaholic and can balance that in a healthy way, great, but SFDC plays lip service to work-life balance in many departments.

7427,3.0,"- There are 4 layers of management between you and the person who manages SMB . All these layers are forecasting to each other and it just seems to fuel the micromanagement activity and meetings for the sake of meetings culture. - Managers only care about their team number and really don't care about how you are doing individually. Leads to micromanagement when the team isn't doing well. If you are doing well, there's no real incentive for you to do better for the sake of the team, it's just what your manager wants. - Territories and verticals are very uneven. Best territories given to more tenured AEs which happens in a lot of companies, but makes your first year difficult to succeed without some luck. - Really not much culture day to day. There are team dinners and days out but not much is done to create a sense of fun in the job itself. This was the same even in the office. - No recognition outside of $ closed. - Apart from one or two, the product specialists only seem to want to help when your deal is about to close."

Under this leadership, the India team has a sluggish growth to their careers. - Unrealistic targets and workloads are set for the team which led to long working hours and high pressure high stress work environment. - Work done here is boring, low impact and repetitive. There was no career defining work in this team for the time this review was written. - Management is a bully, openly threatening and humiliating team mates. Several incidents of this have occurred. But employees are too frightened of retaliation to bring out the issue. - Top down policies and decisions. Team mates have no voice and have to follow all decision leadership makes. - High stress environment created by an autocratic leadership. - Team is expected to work long hours and weekends. - Team are heavily monitored and micromanaged. Egs if you do not clock in by 9 am you will be called out in an email, in a public meeting and reported to HR. - Management is indifferent to creating career growth paths for its team members who do not want to become Solution Engineers. - Limited slow promotions, terrible hikes and highly gated pathways for internal transfer. Management claims that Demo Engineers are highly regarded in the company, yet demo engineers are not top choice for internal transfers, in India. - The leadership of India team creates unofficial policies that are against the overall organisation policies. Examples are non-reimbursement of failed attempts at certification. Use of whatsapp as an official communication channel, tho it is explicitly banned by salesforce. - Skip levels are highly discouraged. These are a threat to India management, in case of whistleblowers."
7456,1.0,"Do not join Salesforce Industries(Vlocity Team) unless you want to ruin your life and career. They are just lucky that they got acquired by Salesforce and now on the name of Salesforce people like us join and get stuck. Their management is very immature and will have expectations from you like working over weekend, working late nights, completing dev works of 3 weeks in 3 days. This team is just like a start-up company. Management is very rude and arrogant. No Work-life balance, Micro Management. This team wont let you change team internally. No career opportunities.

7501,1.0,"Definitely one of the worst decisions of my life. You’d expect a company like Salesforce to have a smooth process. But here’s the real story- My onboarding and interview was an absolute nightmare. This was my dream company, so obviously when I received an offer from them, I accepted it, even if it meant taking a huge pay cut. These guys would leverage Salesforce US culture into talking you down for salaries but would say shamelessly that Salesforce has a transparent pay scale. When I entered the company, I found out that I was the least paid employee in the team. Anyhoo, I accepted the offer and it was their turn to send laptop and other peripherals. Well they didn’t, their procurement team never replied, not on slack, not on calls, not anywhere and I had to bring senior management into this. Well after 15 days of joining, I had received the laptop but mind you even though you don’t have your company phone or company laptop, they’ll start evaluating your performance from day 1, because dude you are in Business Development. So you gotta be an Einstien and a God maybe to do 500 billion things at one time and managers even then would find a way to complain. They expect us to work for 10 hours every day, attend useless meetings, and work like a machine without taking a breath. And they’ll preach about the helping culture of Salesforce, lol. The AEs don’t respond on time, hell even the managers themselves don’t respond until you ping them again and again. And they want us to feel gratitude for the company bevause it pays salary. They have 0 empathy for their employees, they turn deaf ear to our problems. I am suffocating here but I can’t teach out to anyone because guess what everyone is the same. This is a typical employee exploiting company which has created a bubble of a good work culture. PS- this is just for India. I have some friends in the US team of Salesforce and they are having their best time."

7520,5.0,"Sales is sales and with a resetting quota at the end of every month, you have to be prepared to reset at $0 and do it all over again. Even though we get 19 Days off in the first year, it's hard to take time off because the less you work, the less you make. Company is growing from a startup to a major corporation - that growth means there are a lot of things that are changing and you hear about the ""good old days"" a lot - as if you missed out on how things used to be (not pre pandemic, I mean like 10 years ago) and things have changed a lot."
7521,4.0,"Internal hire/promotions make less than external hires. Could be a big difference (Over 100k base - with accelerators/spiffs/bonuses it's worth over 300k difference in pay) Company is getting very big. The young start up, fast pace, and youthful vibe is gone. Lots of people from Oracle and white hair running the company. There are cliques. Usually between internal and external hires. Some management within Enterprise space power trip. Have massive egos. (Not all are like this as some are incredibly humble and well respected)"
7522,5.0,the pay at this company is average but decent with progression
7523,4.0,"As a member of an acquired company, I expected a bit of turbulence during the turnover period, but the disruptions were more significant than I expected. I feel a bit of loss for the culture I joined with. Advancement is a bureaucratic and slow process. To retain staff, they should look into offering benefits that are easier to access, investing in the employee experience in meaningful ways, and prioritizing movement towards and access to advancement."
7524,4.0,Unfortunately your success in sales is really dependent on your territory and timing of the customer. I personally was unlucky with the management as well due to a lot of changes.
7525,4.0,Internal processes and discrepancy in them: start up mentality does not work w tens of thousand’s of employees.
7526,3.0,Hardly anyone hits target - 3 people out of 40+ last year Targets so unrealistic it demotivates you Leaders don't listen to the staff about these targets

7546,4.0,There are not so many challenges
7547,4.0,Honored to work there i love it
7548,3.0,"Salary is not competitive. If you bring up promotion / raise, your manager or RVP is in the ""red"" for attrition, they will not entertain a conversation and have you wait until the new fiscal year. Internal promotions are also not transparent. New hires are compensated more than loyal tenure employees, resulting in lots of employee churn, despite tenure reps are doing more training cause managers are useless. Managers will encourage teams going to the office cause they're scared leadership will realize how useless they actually are and how little value they provide."
7549,5.0,no cons as such no cons as such
7550,5.0,"Highly manager dependant. Especially when coming from a non tech background or from outside the company. Often new managers are poor and take a couple of team cycles to learn the role and until then tend to be dashboard refreshers and somewhat micro manage. This leads to stagnation of people's career and development plans due to the lack of communication, poor expectation setting and focusing solely on the sales target. Current comp plan (2020-2022) is not compartive to the market and is €20-€25k undervaluing your employees. Business Development Representatives are earning more than the majority of ESB and SMB Executives."
7551,5.0,I cant think of any cons
7552,5.0,No such cons found in system
7553,5.0,Very very fast paced tricky to balance work and learning
7554,4.0,Not may interesting projects on Dublin
7555,1.0,- Base salary for internal promotes is significantly lower so you’re effectively punished for staying with the company - Internal meetings & training keep increasing limiting time you can spend with customers - Drink the “kool aid” or risk being shunned - Growing targets with reduced territories - Local leadership are useless and have no authority to action anything. Always go via the US it’s laughable - Workplace bullying and micromanagement is common - Bureaucracy is out of control. Nothing can be done without a form going through a chain of command via 10 people which seems ironic given the who product value proposition is to promote simplicity and automation.
7556,5.0,"Fast path environment. Change is the only constant. Not necessarily a bad thing, as the product is always evolving and you need to be on top of the changes, but can be exhausting."
7557,5.0,No such cons found in system
7558,4.0,politics and pay scale is not equal
7559,2.0,"Salary is under the tech industry avg in Ireland. Left after two years, I feel like the whole environment became much more hostile towards employees. At the beginning there was more learning space, career advancement expectations and good management, but I think the company lost track of the value of the employees lately and they are experiencing high attrition rates as a consequence. No space to express opinions and suggest improvements, some markets are restructured and there is no easiness of communication. Most of the colleagues who started with me left for better opportunities in terms of salary and benefit. HR is very slow at replying and they closed the main Public (internal) channel of communication- I guess because there were too many complaints to take care of. Management is often disorganized and issues are solved slowly if ever, resulting in frustration for the employees and possibly financial and work balance consequences. Satisfaction surveys are often handled out but results are not taken into account- or at least that’s what seems like. Some teams were asked to disclose if they undertake interviews with other companies. No clear vision to go back to office and giving reassurance to teams."
7560,1.0,"Salesforce is a great company, But not the Hyderabad support management. Especially the Hyderabad APAC MC premier Management. There are so many unethical things happening. Trust and equality are one of the core values of Salesforce, But it seems APAC MC premier Management doesn't care these core values. There is no equality shown in terms of work, The management shows partiality and allow their favourites to take easy case/work they want and put pressures on others."

7565,3.0,Tech is not exciting Not meant for hustlers
7566,5.0,Not seen any till now.
7567,4.0,"Targets are very high and in most roles you're working on a saturated market. Prospecting is very difficult as you sometimes only have 3-10 accounts to work with in total, but the target seems to be created from a growth mindset where every account is going through a full digital transformation. Base salaries are relatively low (compared with similar organisations), so if you're not blessed with a great patch, you are going through tough times.

So many tiers of management, so many VPs and SVPs trying to justify whey they're there, it just gets exhausting. You can't quite see the termites, but the underlying rot has set in and been reinforced by all of the Oracle and Microsoft intake. The 'leaders' love talking about 'who they are as a leader (without seeming to understand you're only a leader if someone wants to follow you through choice, not reporting line). Talk of values is kind of funny - everyone loves to tell you what their values are, but ask them what that looks like when they're 'living their values' and they all pretty much draw a blank..."

7694,1.0,"Another tech giant trying to spread the company culture kool aid but doesn’t recognize or address terrible leaders and managers or self appointed “lead EAs”. Very toxic, backstabbing politics going on amongst executive assistants which creates an entire group of disgruntled, distrustful, and power hungry EAs and makes most EAs carry a bad reputation at Salesforce. Execs and managers who have EAs: some of them need serious management training and learn how to treat everyone under them fairly. This was by far some of the worst treatment I’ve ever seen from an exec who had an EA. Micromanaging, having other people spy on the EA and report back to him about the EA's whereabouts and movement.. The EA was treated like a prisoner. Also, there are some EAs who support C-level people and they act as if they are the exec's themselves. They wield their execs' status for their own power and control over others. It's ridiculous and I don't know if the execs who have EAs even know that their EAs are doing this. I hated working with any execs who had EAs. It was always a massive hinderance to my work progress. I don't understand Salesforce and the EA culture.. some are really great EAs but some are terrible and unfortunately they are the EAs at the top.. usually supporting SVP and up. I wouldn’t buy into their culturally appropriated “OHANA” and other Hawaiian sayings. It’s all a facade."
7695,2.0,Too many managers worrying about getting ahead and looking good vs focus on clients and employees. Degrading behavior and not recognizing or acknowledging different experiences and views. Only select few making money

7703,5.0,"The company waivers between a startup culture and a big mature business culture. Some people thrive in one environment or the other, but Salesforce seems to have a little of both. For instance, travel approval requires multiple levels of approval up to a EVP; on the other hand, a phone call secured two programming resources to work on a really cool side project. The con is, I'm not sure what kind of response I'm going to get - startup or big company."
7704,3.0,"The executive leadership team at Salesforce exemplifies the values they espouse and they truly believe that the world can be changed by business. Unfortunately, the values that are core to our belief system (doing what's right for the customer, trust, etc.) do not filter down to the actual sales process. There's a tendency to encourage customers to do things unnatural to their buying process, all in the interest of making the month. You will subjected to immense pressure here. The company, to their credit, has tried to emphasize wellness with meditation rooms in each office, etc. But much like volunteer time off, I know very few sales people that have time to enjoy those perks outside of offsites. With only 50% of AEs exceeding plan, your success depends entirely on timing and territory. AEs who have not missed their number in years come to Salesforce only to fail because the alchemy involved in assigning quotas. There's a reason why so many AEs turn over after less than 2 years. It's unfortunate as the company really wants to do well in the world. The"

7712,5.0,"Was told that there is flexibility to work from home but it depends on the teams.My team prefers working in the office.I prefer working remote as I feel I am productive when I work from home as I can work more without having to stress out being stuck but I am pressurized to get to work.Being a global company, I think the managers need to be offer many remote/home-based work options and not micro manage about working from the office. Of course those instructions need to come from the leadership which this company lacks."

7716,3.0,"- if you are coming for consistent huge commission checks think again. - quotas over 400% of PY actuals - comp plans do not encourage the right behavior, if you can even figure them out - you will sell, but will take multiple years to paint a vision that ends up in a sale large enough to hit your quota."
7717,1.0,The Chicago office is extremely competitive. They make you feel as if you’re going to be hired and they kick you out the door. Unfortunate. The employees are great but the management is awful. This program really needs to redo their management.
7718,4.0,Things are slow... Releasing only 3 times a year doesn't work anymore.
7719,1.0,"Favoritism. Political. Get in with the inner circle (decision makers) and you're golden. Salesforce talks a lot about Ohana, even setting their top method/ measure as ohana - but as many other reviewers mentioned. It's all smoke and mirrors. The culture is cut throat and people help you if they think you can help them in the future. There's no sense of boundaries or work life balance. Managers and stake holders text you nights and weekends asking for something ASAP. Managers manage up here and if your work isn't 100% what they need they question your intelligence. They don't want to mentor or manage, they want robots ready to push out work."

7725,3.0,"While there are some down times, its not uncommon for me to work 10+ hours a day and into the weekends with travel (more normally 1x/week but sometimes 2x/week). With our diverse product set, the list of what a CORE SE is supposed to know grows constantly with insufficient specialist support. I'm a high performer in terms of ACV, but since our comp is more weighted towards team goals I'd rather have a life than have the extra few bucks. I've been asking for help all year, but hiring hasn't kept up with attrition on the team so its getting worse rather than better. I think management does care, but it takes so long to hire and onboard new SEs it takes 3-6 months to get any relief. The promotion process is murky, leaving me wondering if its even worth it to do this. The company says it cares about health and wellness, but Sales is a company within a company with its own culture. In that culture ACV > everything."
7726,5.0,"- Staying motivated can be tough in such a fast paced environment, but they encourage you to utilize your benefits and lean on your team"
7727,5.0,The sales side of things can be hyper-politicized at times. We're a high-performing sales team with big quotas and big goals; with that comes big egos.
7728,5.0,There were large gaps of time between communications and interviews
7729,3.0,- Open floor seating (makes concentrating on a task very hard) - Workflow is extremely sporadic - Cool kids club - Hardly any training. This was over-promised and under-delivered
7730,5.0,Acquisitions have started to spread positions thin but hiring is ongoing.
7731,5.0,Honestly not many that I can think of. The NYC office has great leaders and great AEs.
7732,3.0,VERY silo-ed. You can't swing a surfboard without hitting several VPs. This makes getting large initiatives done a thing of nightmares. The left hand rarely knows what the right hand is doing.
7733,5.0,Blah blah blah blah blah
7734,2.0,"Unattainable sales quotas for the individual contributors. Way too many and unnecessary levels of sales managers (RVP, AVP, etc.) It's like a pyramid scheme here now where the majority of Account Execs don't come close to hitting their number."
7735,5.0,"I started contract and then moved full time after 6 months. I am ok with this process and understand that this is how people are brought on into the recruiting org, however I do not feel there was full transparency through the onboarding process. The info I was given first interviewed (as contract) regarding the full time process was not super clear. While I am completely happy now and ok with the situation, I do feel this communication could be handled better."
7736,5.0,"Supporting resources, career growth coaching, pay"
7737,5.0,Remote workers are unable to travel to meet teams
7738,2.0,"Complete lack of transparency. If your manager tells you anything, you're likely not getting the full story. I'm guessing it used to be a great place to work, but the sheer size of Salesforce has made it impossible for anything to get done."
7739,5.0,"Not many - it can be slightly serious at times but for a high growth company, that's not a surprise."
7740,2.0,"While the west coast may be working on meeting Marc's lofty goals, the midwest(specifically midwest CSG) is swiftly becoming the white male centric world. Women are not staying within various roles within CSG in growing numbers and it's becoming very obvious that this is a white man's world. If you read the Chicago Tribune this weekend, you will not that more and more diversity factors(black, Hispanic, etc) are leaving for more favorable areas from every company, not just SF. If anyone would do the data analysis for CSG Chicago, warning bells should go off. The executive leadership is slowly but surely driving women out of their workforce vs embracing Marc's culture."
7741,4.0,"Most of the cons can be summed up by growing pains. The rate of growth at times creates confusion and certainly poses organizational and system challenges. Salesforce is future focused and perhaps doesn't always take the time to look back to evaluate past performance, instead preferring to move on to the next big thing. The result is that sub-optimal processes don't always get corrected. As the company has grown, a lack of focus on small details results in some areas of the business suffering until something serious occurs that draws attention to it. Salesforce is unabashedly a Customer Company. When given the choice to pivot to Customers, Shareholders, or Employees, the company will always choose Customers. This has resulted in the past with some haphazard and poorly though-through HR decisions. Lots of Employee-related initiatives seem to be thrown together at the last minute."
7742,4.0,"- Pace: simply put, the frenetic company growth is unsustainable. At its peak, think of back-to-back 80 hour weeks, juggling 6 tasks at once, back-to-back meetings & calls to get the job done properly. Annual quotas that continue to go up isn't something that go on forever, right? - Management: The company is growing so fast, first-line managers are going to be the weakness that cripples this company. Not saying there aren't good managers, but there are a lot of bad ones. To fill the void, Salesforce hires externally (i.e. Oracle) who brings their less-than-desirable practice into Salesforce. Lack of homegrown leadership is the company's biggest weakness, by far - Customers get tired: We all hear our customers are tired of getting ""nickled & dimed to death"" because we keep on coming out with new features, new acquisitions, new bundles that cost ""only $xx more per user/month""."
7743,5.0,It's incredibly hard to get hired here & the interview process can be lengthy. The dynamic nature of the company may be hard for those who don't do well with change.
7744,2.0,"People management is very bad... There is massive title inflation. 0-1 year of experience managing people marks most directors, and even many senior directors. There is a serious problem of cronyism in many departments. VPs promote who they want, when they want irrespective of team feedback or even despite what are believed to be established policies. VP-level leadership exhibits schizophrenic decision making, CYA behaviors and abrasive comportment. This makes for highly stressful working environments and is a key cause of the well-known burnout at Salesforce. Many leaders at Salesforce have never done a job this big before which can lend to insecurity and erratic or absent decision making. Reorganizations are painfully frequent which also promotes insecurity & stress."
7745,2.0,"There's zero work/life balance if you're in Services. You are expected to be ""on call"" all hours of the evening, work long hours during the day/week, and forget having any extracurricular activities or spending time with your family. You cannot ""check out"" and it's not a healthy lifestyle. Don't challenge senior leadership on department practices, ways to foster change, or steer from the majority opinion because you will pay for it in performance reviews even though they state in your interview that they love new ideas that change the way they operate. When you add up the hours you actually work during the week, you are significantly underpaid!"
7746,4.0,"Politics and egos are rampant and get in the way of getting things done and feeling a sense of accomplishment. Constantly changing priorities combined with ever growing silo'd thinking/execution can impact job satisfaction. Extremely poor management practices due to new/inexperienced managers, managers with egos who don't understand how to lead a ""team"" to success, and downright unethical behavior with HR turning a blind eye. If you're lucky to get a good manager - someone who advocates for you, highlights your work, and ensures their success through the success of their team - hold on for dear life!"
7747,5.0,"Fire drills. Our company is rapidly growing and we are constantly innovating, which is great! But, it also means that the game plan last year is different from this year's approach. There are fire drills, and strategy shifts. The culture is supportive to the needs of working parents, family needs, personal issues... but anyone considering Salesforce should know... you'll see a few fire drills now and again."
7748,3.0,"- FinSrv vertical is struggling. Big bang accounts are rare and easy lay up accounts are given to Oracle friends, boys click. - FinSrv Accounts pie is cut too many ways - Pay out is every 2+ years if that - Worst is the new Oracle culture. Mgmt is all about badging and silly stickers and certifications you need to get to be able to tell the customer story when they should be helping with relationships & focusing on the problems at hand - global AEs are just in title, they don't actually get paid on global revenue - so watch out for that when you review your comp. - Comp % is low from market but can be better if you are Oracle friends - Mgmt bullies into inflating pipeline and force commit deals every quarter"
7749,5.0,"Like at any enterprise tech company, the work is big and complex. With responsibility over projects that affect hundreds to thousands of people, balancing work priorities and personal life can feel a bit rocky at times. Fortunately, there is always a bright mind to turn to for help and no shortage of motivated, hard-working people around you to get the job done and have a little fun while doing it."
7750,2.0,"Boiler room mentality, customer success is more of marketing-Customers are harassed constantly to keep up with monthly close and cadence.No long term strategy in enterprise accounts and customers are getting fatigued by this behaviour-Micro managment who only care about monthly ACV in Strategic accounts -High turnover in upper end of strategic sales.-Terrible mid level management who manage based on fear over mid 40s experienced sales team for Carolinas and Atlanta-No work life balance"
7751,5.0,Pay is low compared to other companies
7752,4.0,"BUT... The three T's applies here... Territory, Timing and Talent. Salesforce deliberately assign miniature territories and switch them up annually. It forces reps to be hungry, desperate even when you only have a year to close the account. Heaven forbid one of the two accounts that you are assigned goes bankrupt/is acquired/has a spending freeze that year... you're going to sit on the sidelines for a year and hope that you get a decent account the following year in the 'Carve'. If that doesn't work out... you're gone. I've seen literally dozens of top performers getting turfed due to this circumstance. Sales is a rough game sometimes and it's brutal at Saleforce. Great place to work but be careful and do your homework before signing on with them."
7753,5.0,"Highly competitive, which is to be expected."

7756,1.0,"- Work life balance is terrible - They took the alcohol away because they hire alcoholics - Everything is a snowflake and not scalable (they will eventually figure this out and it will hurt when it matters) - Incompetent management (mid and senior level - how are these people getting hired/promoted?) - Too much management so nothing actually gets done - CAB/change management is incompetent - Dev does not seem to know how to make their products stable or supportable - Infrastructure does not seem to know how to make their environments stable - Meetings (let's have a meeting about a meeting and we will schedule a meeting to discuss the meeting) - Internal Salesforce recruiting/hiring is worthless - Indy Tower move provides no benefit to employees and worsens work life balance - Commute worse now since the move to the ivory tower - Pay for your own parking (penalized for not living in the city) - No real room for growth within Marketing Cloud for SREs - Worst career decision I have made from a skill set perspective (no marketable skill set growth outside of the company) - Company liberal agenda constantly shoved down your throat - Employees placed into a silo - Mandatory holiday work for Marketing Cloud so other companies can send more spam to people who do not want it - SRE team mandatory weekly on call rotation recently went from 4 weeks/year to 15 weeks/year (yes, seriously, and that is the main reason I quit Salesforce for a real #dreamjob elsewhere) - The company itself provides no real benefit to society so they allow employees to volunteer to feel fulfilled on the inside but really it is thinly veiled attempt at marketing and promotion of the company - Stressful workplace - Job titles are made up - Open office concept is detrimental to productivity and health in general - Cult feeling with all the internal lingo - Ridiculous amount of money spent on unnecessary things but then they take away the small amount of money they contributed to parking costs which is a necessity - Giant corporation now... culture cannot keep up with acquisitions. News flash: people are different in different parts of the country and the rest of the world. Company needs to just admit they are the same as other giant corporations. - No longer feels like a innovative/entrepreneurial/start-up company (Now we just buy those kinds of companies, even if it doesn't make sense. I'm looking at you Quip.) - The company has never told a customer no, even when they needed to do so and the company is feeling it - Company seems to reward bad client behavior instead of correcting it - I am tired of typing but there are definitely more cons than pros"

7759,5.0,None. Everything is perfect at salesforce
7760,1.0,"Sort of bizarre workplace environment & culture. I didn't see much in the way of manager training or ensuring that the right ICs were promoted to people manager roles. Annual reviews are in no-way transparent. You are assessed on a set of criteria that is not shared with you (either the criteria or the assessment results). My review was five minutes: ""You're doing great!"" There was no actionable feedback, stretch goals or written documentation for me to learn and grow from. Leadership in my org very often resorted to bullying and openly shared negative feedback on their own peers with their reports. Several times while working there, I lost my engineering title due to re-orgs and was told that they ""didn't want to transfer headcount,"" so was left with only limited technical work to do for long stretches. And that's my biggest complaint - at least in my org, hard and innovative work was not championed but rather avoided in pursuit of very easy and short-term goals."
7761,2.0,The territories are treated as though they each have the same sales potential with each having the same quota. Though in reality the territories are not the same and each year the territories get smaller and smaller while the the quota rises. The company is satisfied with having only 55% achieve their quotas and qualify for club because they don't expect 45% of the reps to attain their quotas. So 45% of the reps are set up for failure. They also bait and switch territories as a way to attract talent. They make you a job offer for a particular territory only to tell you after you have been hired and left your previous job that your territory has changed...and typically the new territory is not of the same caliber and potential of what was promised. Also when a new sales rep joins the company they find that their territory has been cherry picked by several reps on their sales team each having hold outs preventing you from selling into these accounts for up to 90 days. And there is no quota relief for this lost revenue potential.
7762,1.0,"No loyalty. I was an employee for nearly 7 years. Every year I received a stellar performance review, a good raise and bonus, and more stock. I even won awards for innovation and developing new ways to work. At one point it ""was"" a great place to work. In late 2013, I got a new manager. She made lots of comments about wanting people on her team who were ""young and hungry"". I turned 58 last year and assume I just got too old for her and the company. She eliminated my job, told me it wasn't personal, gave me a 6 week severance package and sent me on my way. Now, after 15 months of unemployment, I've lost my house, am living in my car and desperately trying to find a job. I had a great career that was ruined by this manager. HR let it happen knowing what a good employee I was. They just wanted to make my manager happy. For all their claims of being socially conscious and their philanthropic work, they certainly didn't care about me. The company is very calculated in their claims about promoting women. Right before I left, they had terminated at least 12 female VP's. Some were replaced with men."
7763,5.0,"Being a remote employee I wish we had dedicated monthly times to take trips to work/meet with your team! With that being said, they have no problem with remote employees taking the time to go visit and immerse themselves with their teams. I just wish it was more frequent and scheduled!"
7764,3.0,"New AE product enablement is embarrassingly bad. The first 12 months are sink or swim, and aside from self-enabling yourself, the territories are hit or miss. Sales reps that have crushed their quota at other companies often struggle due to poor territory carves and slow enablement ramp time. Furthermore, Marketing Cloud basically acts as its own company within Salesforce. Collaboration with the CRM business is weak at best, and Marketing Cloud's biggest competitor has been its own internal solution, Pardot. Last, sales managers here are mostly just that, managers. True leaders in management are few and far between. For example, struggling AEs are mostly on their own to figure it out, which is resulting in higher AE turnover."
7765,1.0,"Management is full of hyprocrisy. Salesforce's core values include things like transparency and equality, both of which have been completely ignored on our team (and apparently also on other teams after reading other reviews here). There is a complete lack of communication from the top down, which makes our team unable to perform our work well. Furthermore, there is little feedback on how we can get promotions or raises. There is a culture of not giving feedback and you need to ""read between the lines"" in order to know what feedback there is (this is what was told to me by management). On our team, promotions are given to the men more often than the women, and men with the same title and less experience as women have higher salaries. Also, the skill of managing people isn't seen as part of the requirements of being a people manager. A lot of people who are great individual contributors get promoted to Manager and aren't very good at their new job of dealing with their direct reports, but upper management doesn't care. Work life balance is also not very flexible during busy season (which lasts from October through March)."
7766,4.0,"Cutthroat sales floor, high visibility, no work-life balance, monthly quotas stressful, sell in Salesforce Way, very political"
7767,3.0,"The same people keep getting promoted - ""visionary"" salesmen - not the people who actually do the work. Projects are only 60% completed before the groupthink in ""leadership"" decide to move on to the next shiny thing. Sales are always first priority and take up about 90% of the attention. Clients, employees, technology, have to clamour for the remainder. No Signing Bonus Annual/Quarterly Bonuses are nominal until you are at least director level - and there's no path to promotions."
7768,3.0,"The Ohana culture is wonderful but unfortunately it's not practiced by many leaders. They don't reward good leadership and embodying the culture. I had heard it was the influx of the Oracle culture - and the sad part is we talked a lot about how important the culture was but we didn't hold senior leadership for it...so there was a lot of bad behavior (yelling, bullying, not allowing work/life balance, etc) . Felt a lot like it was all for PR and branding but not really what was valued or practiced. There also is a lot of breaking points due to scaling growth - systems and technology in many functions are a joke. Many groups have had to create very manual processes b/c the systems are unreliable or not kept up to standard to scale."
7769,2.0,"- Work environment is highly politicized in projects, promotions, and basically anything you do - Not everyone is pulling their own weight - Very little accountability in the organization. The company did away with formal performance reviews a few years ago. There is a culture of praise here, so constructive feedback is rarely given - Roles and teams are incredibly silo'd now. This is not the place to be if you're looking to grow and develop your career in a multitude of different ways - Easy to get lost in the sea of things: the company has grown way too large in recent years - Growth and progression are slow. Career development is non-existent if you remain in your current position. Since there are so many employees now, each job that an employee has is incredibly specific, so if you want a change of pace, you'd have to change out of your role entirely Also, for what it's worth, I strongly believe that Salesforce actively reaches out to news outlets and pays to get on those ""Best Employer"" lists that come out yearly. I wouldn't be surprised if they had people in HR write numerous positive reviews to artificially inflate the Glassdoor scores."
7770,4.0,"Management wants to get great survey scores from clients, but tied our hands on budget/scope on engagements with no wiggle room"
7771,3.0,Huge variation in talent and leveling due to fast growth - opportunity for fast growth has now slowed and is determined more on time in role than talent. Managers often are tough - have had little people management training. Marketing plays backseat to sales in the organization.

Unfriendly, territorial and insecure peers. Non-ironic lectures about “ohana” from hostile coworkers. First place I’ve ever worked where I get *scolded* for getting things done. Incredibly demoralizing. Unbelievably inefficient working styles, with no appetite for improvement. Management overly focused on complexifying rather than simplifying, likely due to tiny scope, inexperience and insecurity. Disorganized functions with may overlapping siloed layers and groups who duplicate effort."

Also, not really cons, but challenges: it's hard to balance an intense, growing, sales-oriented company with all the good work, culture, and support we receive. Salesforce is among the best at balancing, but there are no silver bullets. Company has grown to a very large size quickly and managing scale is also challenging. Again, the culture and communication make it among the best at this size and growth rate, but it too can be a challenge sometimes."
7791,5.0,1) Competitive promotion process. Time in role is definitely a big factor. 2) Fast-paced work can lead to lack of role clarity & overlapping/redundant work at times. 3) Lack of documentation for certain things. You kind of just have to figure stuff out through trial and error.

7803,1.0,"You are truly just a number, and are very easily replaced. If you aren't a favorite of upper management (which is based solely on the number of hires you make a quarter, and nothing else whatsoever), you cannot succeed here. Salesforce claims to be the best company to work for, and from a birds eye view it is. But what they don't tell you about is the amount of politics, favoritism, back-stabbing, and lack of empathy from management and above."
7804,1.0,"Salesforce is the most toxic organization I have ever worked for, and I've worked for a lot of organizations as both an FTE, contractor, and consultant over the past two decades. Trying to pare down what I want to warn others of is difficult. I'll just bullet it out and you can decide what would wear you down, disrupt your sleep, and leave you paranoid, the most. - 1:1s with senior management where the most hateful things are said about your character, etc., and then afterward, the manager acts as though it never happened. -Pressure to give Salesforce a glowing Glassdoor rating after less than 30 days at the company when you do not know enough to provide an accurate review. - No written reviews, something called a 9 box where management provides their opinion of you and tells you it exists but then says you are never allowed to see it, per H/R. - If you want to apply for an internal position, you must have your manager's permission first. If you tell your manager you want to apply for the role and he/she does not want to lose you, he/she just says, no, you do not have my permission. Game over, you are going no where. - If you are allowed a desk (many have to submit to hoteling and never knowing where they will sit day to day), no personal plants, photos, or non SF toys allowed. They want a uniform look to the desks. -Forced volunteerism, if you do not log your 50 hour minimum of volunteer hours per year, you will be shamed at team meetings. Doesn't matter if you have kids, sick parents, 60 hour work week, whatever, you are expected to make the minimum. -No criticism of Benioff permitted. And don't ever say out loud that you found it disturbing to see a laying on of hands and someone praying over him as though he were a prophet at an internal company meeting. Management will quickly remind you that he is leading the 4th industrial revolution and he is the leading mind of our time. -If you are managing young hourly employees, be prepared to be instructed that you are to tell them they MUST go to team dinners, volunteer events, and SF ""fun"" activities but this is not work, so they don't get paid. If you push back, you will be reprimanded for ""not being Ohana."" - Teams are run by popularity. Backstabbing, shaming, and shunning are used to get the teams to stay quiet about how bad things are. People who speak out about behaviors, lack of professionalism, etc. are labeled, ""unOhana"" and told that they are not acting like family. - When you interview and you take a position, there is ZERO guarantee that the role you interviewed for and were hired for is the role you will be doing. The management opinion is to hire highly qualified people, they will be so grateful to be permitted to work at Salesforce, they will do whatever job we give them. I kid you not, you may have more than a decade of experience, be highly technical, have managed teams, and be hired for a technical role, then be told you are going to do data entry level work and you will be glad you are permitted to be at this company doing that. -If you are uncomfortable participating in some public events, e.g. parades, events, etc., and SF is participating in one, there is incredible pressure to spend your weekend in the parade or event. The expectation is that Salesforce and its needs come first. I cannot stress this enough, you are told that Salesforce is YOUR family and your family comes first. A lack of loyalty to the company will get penalized far more significantly and quicker than complete incompetence, maliciousness, or even harassment. Salesforce demands absolute devotion."

Worse still is the 40 acts of vaudeville to figure out if you will get paid, if you get paid and what amount they base it on. We are out there saying use Salesforce as your system of record and every month my Xactly has little similarity to my sales in Salesforce. Come on, guys. Let's not be hypocrites! Then when you think it can get no worse there is a virtual rubics cube of ways you lose ACV or see $ clawed back. You have to be an accountant to figure out if you can sell to an account and retire quota. It's ridiculous how many times, in a short time I have not gotten the full value of my sale due to some arbitrary attrition I was not even aware of as a co-prime. Do you want me to sell or do you want me to audit the accounts to see if I can retire quota with a sale?"

7811,3.0,"Their core codebase is a nightmare to develop on. 30 minutes of build time to just fail out due to a minor build issue. And just because tests pass locally doesn't mean they will pass in the remote build, and you won't find out for 4 hours if you are lucky. This wouldn't be the worst if it was well documented, but everything is passed on via tribal knowledge, so if you are on a small team with maybe 1 engineer with tenure, pray they know what they are doing."
7812,1.0,"- Racism is prevalent everywhere. Unless you speak Hindi or are a South Indian, white male, expect no growth. They speak Hindi in meetings, and are not inclusive at all to others outside this group - Liars. They won't tell you the real function of the job. They claim to be great at tech, but its all very outdated technology. It moves very slowly, so don't expect to work on anything new while at Salesforce - Absent management. Managers are never around and they won't help. They are also racist if they are South Indian. They choose to talk only to others on the team of the same race as them and only promote those individuals - Your work will be stolen by more senior engineers and management won't side with you.

Not saying there aren't good managers, but there are a lot of bad ones. To fill the void, Salesforce hires externally (i.e. Oracle) who brings their less-than-desirable practice into Salesforce. Lack of homegrown leadership is the company's biggest weakness, by far - Customers get tired: We all hear our customers are tired of getting ""nickled & dimed to death"" because we keep on coming out with new features, new acquisitions, new bundles that cost ""only $xx more per user/month""."

Some managers think their reports should work like their servants and should not express their opinion, too much partiality. When teams move under different managers, this becomes rampant. Managers from certain ethnicity have very less opinion on women workers. Have seen several emotional incidents several times.

This wasn't obvious to me because the compensation was considerably higher than at my previous company. I wished I had asked more questions and had asked for a higher title. (3) No cafeteria at HQ: you need to leave the building to grab food. This by itself is not a big issue. In fact, it means you have so many different lunch options ... every day. Yet, the ability to socialize with co-workers within your team and more importantly outside your team is not as easy as at companies where there is a common lunch area. At my previous company, lunch break was an opportunity to run into people and have a quick chat, which was helpful for maintaining relationships."

If you can suck up to your manager you can get all your perks. Some teams to prove themselves, try to step in other teams projects and take over and send them out. Some managers think their reports should work like their servants and should not express their opinion, too much partiality. When teams move under different managers, this becomes rampant. Managers from certain ethnicity have very less opinion on women workers. Have seen several emotional incidents several times. I am sure this is going to become big in coming days as SFDC is becoming a giant. Not many women workers in management positions. Sr. Mgmt is worse as they don't know technical issues at all.

Salesforce is all smoke and mirrors, great place to work, but their sales teams all stab eachother in the back. Try asking people about the relationships between EMEA and NorthAmerica on accounts.

I was hopeful with the acquisition but it hasn't been what I had hoped at all. There's been several people who have been let go from sales and for the first time in nearly 4 years of working here I am nervous about potentially losing my job. It's really sad as a year ago I could have seen being here for a large part of my career but I guess thats tech, ever changing, and volatile.

If that doesn't work out... you're gone. I've seen literally dozens of top performers getting turfed due to this circumstance. Sales is a rough game sometimes and it's brutal at Saleforce.

I’ve worked at other tech companies and I’ve never seem anything so pathetic. *terrible middle management, I mean terrible. Keep in mind this review is coming from someone who was cosidered realtively succssful, and still think this place is a joke. Anyways, I digress.... Middle management for the most part is made up of people who lack leadership skills, talent, experience. It’s actually joke. It’s like a weird cesspool of account executives being promoted to management. One day theyre your peer, the next day, they’re your superior. Not saying they’re racist or anything, but holy hell, talk about 95% Caucasians Being promoted into these roles. Overall, management (based on my experience, observations, talking to peers,etc) literally brings NO value. They just sit at their computer and run reports, show up late to customer meetings, sit awkwardly/quietly in a conference room during a customer call, but during 1on1s (these are also frequent, redundant, waste of time), they offer to sit in on calls/meetings as if They are providing value. If you’re one of the unfortunate suckers/victims to work for Salesforce please please please understand, your entire success, compensation, will be 99% based on the territory handed to you. That’s it point blank. All the other BS, is Just that BS. Run a few reports and you’ll see the top performs get most of their ACV from organic aka gimmes or flips aka warm leads handed to them by the inside biz dev team. Team. Yes, working hard and doing everything the right way (by the book) will give you a very slight edge, but if you’re not handed a fruitful territory you WILL NOT hit quota or make money. Pleeeeasse, please take this as the truth. Again, I was a top 10-20% person, and I’m leaving this review. I could go on and on, but I’ll end it with this. If you’re an experienced sales professional, do NOT work here. You will regret it and regret it fast.

Seeing lots and lots of angry current customers... 8/10 if you don't have 5-6+ years of inside/outside sales experience, you will only be considered for an SDR or BDR role. This could be fine, but the role should incorporate more closing of business if you are basically expecting people to take a demotion for the role and not articulating the position clearly (this could just be an issue with my office though). If you are on the BDR team you can be the hardest working person and still not hit your number because of how your quota is attained. Your manager will ""help you"" come up with ""strategic plans"" to hit your number (basically just tell you to make more calls/set meetings) but it doesn't matter because if you AEs refuse the meetings, don't feel like moving them to a stage 2 (everyone perceives what this means differently), don't have time to take them until the next month, etc. then you are screwed. BDR management doesn't align with AE management at all. Therefore, they don't care about anything except their AEs closing deals (I don't blame them!), they are annoyed when BDR management comes complaining that their AEs aren't working with their BDR... This is just not a conducive business model and doesn't help growth initiatives. Not everyone is measured the same. You could be aligned 2-4 AEs or 10-15 AEs as a BDR. Either way, these people are expected to generate the same amount of ""stage 2"" opportunity. If you have 2 AEs that are busy, don't work in your office or don't have the ""need"" for a BDR to generate pipeline - then you have NO chance of hitting your quota. SDRs, BDRs and AE's are all expected to generate their own pipeline - which makes sense but it is causing people to compete with each other which takes away from making the customer #1 priority. This is especially bad since the Mulesoft migration... (from BDR POV) Although Salesforce always talks about endless internal growth opportunities, this is def not something that I have seen to be encouraged. You are pretty much forced to take the typical promotion track. BDR Management is way too pushy with BDRs setting new meetings and business, while this should be a significant responsibility, lots of customers get mislead, forgotten, or treated with poor customer service which eventually will backfire (I have already seen it backfire a few times!) As a BDR you could generate $5mil in the pipeline one month, but only have 2 stage two opptys on the board (you need around 6-8)...which means you will miss your quota. Others could have 6-8 opptys on the board which only adds up to $300k in pipe for the month, but they will hit quota.. Doesn't make sense."

Do not expect work life balance. - Claim they pay hourly including overtime, but management often caps hour submission at a certain level. Therefore, don’t expect to get paid for all the hours you actually work. - don’t anticipate management to help or coach you - culture seems very dependent on your location, rely on culture reviews accordingly. - Big push for monthly quotas, yet told by tenure employees almost 60% of business done in the last quarter.

If that is the case, you might be very happy here. Work-life balance doesn't exist and there are constant changes of direction.

There are very few people that are hitting their annual numbers and the overall compensation plus base is just not there. So much of it is based on territory but leaders will say to their graves that all territories are even. We would have much more appreciated it being called out vs. lying to our faces that they are all spread equally. Overall there is a lot of negativity here and much of this stems from the unhappy customers. Salesforce customers, especially in the SMB space don’t have the money to spend to implement Salesforce so their orgs are bad and adoption is extremely low. Account executives are responsible for selling - but also dealing with all unhappy customers, cancellations, technical support questions, etc. It doesn’t help that the renewals and billing teams are both outsourced to foreign counties and are extremely hard to work with (both internally and externally).

Instead it's just adding work load on top of our existing work load. Also, the company really exemplifies the wealth gap, with those at the top heavily rewarded with expensive trips, awards (including cars, watches, etc.) while the majority of the company is paid somewhere around the 75th percentile of industry.

7965,2.0,"On a recent survey, two of the lowest scoring questions revolve around people politicking and backstabbing to get things done and the lowest score company wide was promotions are handled in a fair and transparent way. The promotion question has been a bottom 5 scoring question for 2 years now. I have witnessed people promoted either for unfair reasons or because threatening to leave. They pass off a promotion as someone being promoted when in all actuality they applied to an internal job posting and were hired, that’s not really a promotion. The answer to fixing this is not more documentation on careers. They put on a front that they value trust and transparency. They want you to be able to have difficult conversations with your manager without fear of retaliation, but I have witnessed people who speak up and are retaliated against with maybe a Performance Improvement Plan or a demotion. I sometimes feel as if managers and leaders here are talking the talk but not walking the walk when it comes to truly living by the Ohana values. There is a feeling on some teams that it is easier and less stressful not using your PTO vs using it. Tough finding and training multiple backups to handle their job and yours while out. Recently a decline in billable work that has them reassigning people to new careers. It is tough seeing work sent to vendors in India when people at Salesforce are struggling to get billable work. Bonus for some 100% based on billable work which you have no control over. Person A could have 4 accounts and 40+ billable hours, resulting in a very healthy bonus; while Person B might have 1 account and is receiving 10 hours of work, receiving a much smaller bonus. The division of labor is not fair and should be distributed more evenly. Seems a bit unfair when Salesforce gives an executive a $200,000 car and $86,000 watch as a bonus for exceptional work, when you have witnessed others do exceptional work on a smaller scale (not necessarily bringing in $8 million in Sales) and all they get is a Chatter shoutout from their manager or their name mentioned on a PowerPoint slide. I agree with another review here...it is tough dealing with a travel ban, not being able to travel to visit coworkers during a Christmas party, but the top people were all in Hawaii that year. I remember that."

People at the company are seemingly fake as well, they give off a pleasant vibe but turn around and trash talk other employees. The work is very bland and the product itself is legacy and uninteresting. There's no room for creativity and innovation at all. I don't understand how Salesforce is at the cutting edge of technology when the product itself is easily reproduced. Benefits and perks are subpar compared to other SF/Bay Area tech, no free lunch, no phone or commuter benefits."

But again, that can change without much notice since re-orgs happen every 3 months. Think before you join. Not bad to get it on resume then move on"
7971,5.0,"In the short time I was there, I did not find any downsides."
7972,5.0,"Relatively low pay, Not cutting edge technology."
7973,4.0,"Kind of boring if you stay long. Not so many choices, and not flexible in areas you are interested, so it really depends on your interest."
7974,5.0,None in my opinion. Salesforce is a great company and good people overall.
7975,5.0,I can't find any at this time
7976,5.0,Regular issues you face at a large corporate like company. Not very easy to move up but there's still ample opportunity.
7977,4.0,techniques are not that interesting
7978,5.0,nothing.. continue to stay laser focused on big picture and reduce noise associated as we continue on our growth trajectory.
7979,4.0,Sometimes overtime is very pushy. Management is not very clear. Different people might lead you at same time.
7980,2.0,If you are the kind of person who thrives on appearance and taking credit for others work OR if you're a manager. Then this is the place for you. Work is not connected to pay. The impression of work is. Manager are pretty much guaranteed promotions every year if they don't distribute their budget on promoting their hires. I've known developer who've left because of this and also conscientious managers who were tired of playing the devil. Tripled in size in 3 years and the culture is no more. Now it's a hodgepodge of Microsoft and oracle.
7981,3.0,remote employees such as me struggle to find info and support from headquarters.
7982,4.0,None that I can think of.

7991,5.0,Nothing i could think of. Its a great place to work
7992,5.0,Not much worth a mention
7993,4.0,"This is a big company that focuses mostly on B2B tech, so it can feel very corporate. Vibe depends on which division you're in."
7994,4.0,Limited professional growth opportunity and lots of red tape
7995,4.0,"* Would like to see more accountability for being great managers * Be great to have a real gym in our building (do get a fitness studio (no equipment) and gym discounts) * Better, healthier, more snack and lunch options, including a true cafe"
7996,3.0,"That being said, seriously, most people that work here are hacks and idiots. It's 2015 and they're building software like it's still 1998. Don't expect to come here and learn anything other than how to pass the hot potato. You'll spend 95% of your time doing ""keep the lights on"" work, fixing messes that were created 5+ years ago but people were to dumb to notice. Those people who made those messes are no in key, influential positions within the company, where their questionable decision making has maximum impact to shoot themselves in the foot."
7997,4.0,lots to learn and things are always changing. high quotas.
7998,3.0,Poor management. Lots of growing pains.
7999,2.0,"- The Kool-Aid. You must LOVE the product, LOVE your team, LOVE your managers, LOVE the process. Oh, and you better LOVE going to happy hours, clubs and team outings with your coworkers. - Because of the terrible work/life balance, brown-nosing to get ahead is very very prevalent. There's a huge amount of gossip and ""buy in"" that's required. It's not a workplace for individuals, it's a workplace for THEIR individual."

8001,5.0,* Not the smartest of folks on some of the teams.
8002,5.0,- Keeping up with growth
8003,3.0,Lack of career planning Oracle hires
8004,3.0,"If your boss is difficult, upper management won't care"
8005,5.0,"It got big - even bigger now. Still has a great culture for a 10K+ employee company, but getting the Oracle leadership in on the sales side, although necessary for the size and time to grow, stifled the culture a bit."
8006,4.0,*low base salaries in sales roles *saturated marketplace
8007,4.0,- QA role varies from team to team. Not very challenging sometimes. -
8008,4.0,"- Talent Vacuum - after an acquisition, people tend to leave - Salesforce and ET Cultures both great, but very different"
8009,5.0,Work life balance in sales is challenging. Poor job of using modern technology for marketing (heavy reliance on events)
8010,2.0,"Transitioning from start-up to big corporation, execs are young and eager to please parent company in Cali by kissing up while transferring the stress to employees. Zero tolerance for mistakes but not giving any warning sign until the last minute before they fire you. Due to poor location excellent employees are few and far between, so mediocre but ass-kissing people get to stay. Managers are all great players of politics. Employees don't dare to speak their mind just to keep their jobs in the ""best"" company of the area. Mid-level people managers have no clue in managing so resort to micromanagement. Typical ""boys club"" culture with no advancement opportunity for female. Only those who play well with their managers and drink the Salesforce cool-aid will thrive. The V2MOM is a joke as performance review has nothing to do with it, meaning delivering results doesn't mean you are good enough. Fear of mistakes and risk averse mindset is suffocating the humanity and innovation this company once had."
8011,4.0,"It's common you see reps kill it in a territory, and struggle to hit quota the next year due to territory realignment."
8012,5.0,There are so many challenging projects to work on that it's sometimes hard to say no so you can find some work-life balance. High expectations to respond instantly even off hours.
8013,1.0,Interview process is not reasonable.
8014,5.0,Need to be more cohesive on product strategy. Still a feeling that if you're not at the mothership (in San Francisco) you miss out on a lot of opportunities and not totally a part of the company culture.
8015,5.0,If you are not invested in your career then Salesforce is not the place for you. There is always something to learn and you still need to do your day job.
8016,5.0,can't think of any cons
8017,5.0,Some overlap between competing teams. Scrum team priorities can change frequently. Can seem a bit chaotic at times.
8018,5.0,"It is a big company, and knowledge transfer is always tricky. I suspect that there is a bit of duplicity that goes on in engineering, and there are definitely things that parts of the business have learned that other parts of the business could be greatly benefited from but don't know anything about."
8019,1.0,"Base pay will be lower than their competitors. You'll be expected to work long hours, a lot of overtime and practically live there at the end of each month and quarter. Hard to obtain quotas, but you'll get no sympathy if you speak up or ask for support. It's a machine...a hard-core, cold-calling environment. Your phone WONT ring just because they're ""Salesforce"", despite what they'll feed you in your interview. If you're headed there...prepare for the stress and long nights!"
8020,5.0,The company has changed a lot in the last few years. Feedback from many people still there is that the culture is changing dramatically and that Oracle is having a reunion of sorts at their expense.
8021,5.0,Nothing... Its a joy coming into work every day
8022,5.0,I can't think of any thing.
8023,5.0,Not very strong presence in Latin American companies
8024,1.0,The most arrogant company I have ever worked for. Corporate does not believe in listening to the field or their customers. They will tell you every one loves them but adoption of the product is low. I gladly took a pay cut to get out of the company
8025,5.0,The monthly cadence / quota can be overwhelming for certain personalities but the reward (compensation) makes up for the stress.
8026,2.0,"Only a fraction of enterprise reps make their number..if you're a great rep and you work hard you still only have a one in six chance of making your number. Accounts are dolled out like it's the Wild West. Managers pick their favorite rep and assign the best accounts.. Even if your lucky enough to get good accounts (which I was)there are so many reps you will only get 2-3 active accounts. It's also a micro management, Oracle environment... The beatings will continue until morale improves.. Attrition is really, really high. Do yourself a favor and look elsewhere."
8027,2.0,My job was eliminated and I was told someone would help me find a new position within the company and I had a month.. They contacted me at week 3 and nothing..... I miss Exact Targets culture and the parent company is micro managing them... A lot of shifting is going on and no one is really safe.
8028,5.0,There's nothing bad about working for this company.
8029,5.0,"- too large, tough to get things done - spends a lot of money on events, not sure on the return"
8030,5.0,- Fast growth means less time to stop and smell the roses and revel in accomplishments.
8031,4.0,Territory alignment is not competitive or divided appropriately
8032,5.0,Too big a company to make some real change or big impact
8033,3.0,Stress created by micro-managing employees
8034,3.0,Layers of management and a pecking order to move up
8035,4.0,did not find any cons
8036,2.0,"Office driven culture, very transactional, you will not make money if you are put in a bad territory. Office politics are some of the worst I have ever experienced. Zero diversity, no women managers."
8037,2.0,"Micromanagement, poor leadership. Complete shift in culture over the past couple years. After the acquisition everything went downhill."
8038,5.0,"None so far, but I guess cross-training in different roles would allow for better structure and career path planning. Current structure encourages shadowing, but there is no formal process in place."
8039,5.0,Too soon to share anything yet.
8040,5.0,"Salesforce has over 15k employees, about 90% of them are sales guys, which I can not speak for. For R&D: 1. Hiring standards has been deteriorating day by day. We used to be really great at it, but now we are hiring people blindly. If we are to maintain the quality, we need to standardize the process, and learn from top tech companies(as we claim to be one). We pay pretty well compared to top tech firms in bay area, and I am sure with right interview process and effort from recruiters(hire more recruiters and tell them to reach out to everyone), we should we able to hire great engineers. 2. We have too many titles in R&D, this is great to keep employees motivated and promote them and I get that. BUT, you got to respect the title. I have seen people with very less experience and contributions, becoming Principle Engineers. I bet, these so called Principle Engineers, wont be able to pass entry level engineer's interview at a good tech company. PLEASE FIX THIS. 3. Another thing which is hurting the quality of engineering organization is letting QAs move to development without any interviews. I agree with the idea of allowing people to move between roles and do different things, but we must maintain the same interview standards while doing so. We all know that hiring standards for dev and QA are far apart, then letting QAs move to dev so easily has become a shortcut and no one is getting benefitted by this other than the individual. This hurts both dev team (as now they have to explain every line of code to QA) and it also hurts QA team as they will always have to hire new QAs (since the existing ones become dev) 4. I am not sure if this is salesforce or recruiters, but they dont give you good equity if you dont negotiate hard. The equity I have seen so far is around 50% of what a tech company in bay area (at our level) offers. 5. We have a great work culture at company, which is getting polluted by more and more higher management coming from Microsoft and Oracle. I always wonder, why we never get higher management from companies we admire (Google, Facebook, LinkedIn....). Now, these new managers are polluting the culture by thier micromanagement philosophy of earliest companies. For instance, now managers are asking receipt for $7 lunch arranged for a team meeting. This is not salesforce."
8041,4.0,My department along with many others is going through constant re-org. It doesn't feel like you're able to make much of a positive impact or move the needle with the business during times like these. It can be political chaos for months.
8042,4.0,Too much busywork from HQ
8043,5.0,"high stress position, quotas can be high, feeling that we are not as valued by the parent company"
8044,3.0,I always working long hours
8045,4.0,"Feeling big now. . .wish I had joined 10 years ago. Was hard to find a great job to continue my career there. Lots of new SENIOR folks from Oracle and I think it felt as if this was shutting down opportunities for people who were not in the ""club""--in sales."
8046,3.0,"Sounds ironic, but destructive, moral crushing obsession with updating Salesforce."
8047,5.0,Fast pace is fun but makes life balance challenging.
8048,4.0,none that come to mind
8049,3.0,"*AEs getting pinched on territories WW *Management is bringing in the ""Oracle 10 legged Meeting Methodology"" *Very political"
8050,3.0,Very stressful! I had to forgo my work life balance totally!
8051,4.0,It can definitely feel like you're a cog in a very big machine. It's very easy to feel lost or have your supervisors lose you.
8052,4.0,Need to work on efficiency of repeatable processes
8053,3.0,But middle management spoiling the culture created by top management. Middle management seems to fight with each other for wrong reasons. Company has grown big and the middle management does not know how to handle it. Re-orgs happens without a reason and the new management whoever joins tend to shakes good amount of teams without knowing what they are upto and how it will impact the company and individuals. No clear communication on the changes and re-orgs.
8054,5.0,"Internal politics, maintaining internal equity, red tape"
8055,4.0,"Company is over-reliant on the heroic effort of its individuals in operations and development teams. There can be burn-out. Some departments struggle with too many people who want to manage or coordinate work, and not enough people to actually get it done. Unpredictable hiring freezes will often negatively impact a group's ability to scale."
8056,3.0,"If you're stuck with a terrible manager, you're screwed. Changes come from management down, not from employees upward. Performance reviews can be quite subjective...."
8057,4.0,Having more seasoned management to aid with change management would make it better.
8058,5.0,Getting to be a bigger company.
8059,1.0,"Very Political, Environment of bulling by the ES senior team. Im competent ES team."
8060,1.0,"You'll be worked to the point of exhaustion on a regular basis and down time to recuperate does not exist. One of the most arrogant work cultures I've ever experienced, people are much more concerned with being right, than in finding solutions together. I don't think I've ever worked at a more self centered, egotistical, backstabbing culture in my life."
8061,2.0,"It's Like College: there are a lot of bright engineers with wonderful, though impractical, theories, and operations often suffers due to a lack of people with more grounded, experienced perspectives It's Like College...you can even graduate early: If you're promoted, you're even more likely to stay less than four years, being a VP in operations is like being the drummer in Spinal Tap, you'll mysteriously leave one day and be replaced by someone else...who will also also leave under bizarre circumstances in 9 months It's Like College: when you make it to five years, you start to feel like all your friends have graduated and moved on, and you're the old guy telling stories about 2009 It's Like College: much of the technology the company uses was developed when I was still a university student It's Like College: there's a lot of unusual PR that's used to help sell the place to new recruits It's Like College...in North Korea: Your job is a dream! Post that to your Facebook and LinkedIn, and do it now!"
8062,4.0,"It's gotten huge, a lot of folks do come from Oracle and you feel more and more like a little cog in a huge machine."
8063,1.0,Technology is outdated. Things move super slowly.
8064,4.0,"Enterprise software is not particularly exciting. Pay is good, but not exceptional. Hiring bar may be slipping a bit. Not a super ""perk-y"" company. No free lunches, etc."
8065,5.0,"The role of the Success Architect, previously known as Program Architect, is very challenging. Clients typically sign a one year contract with salesforce for your services - so you are dedicated to one customer at a time, for one year at a time. The role is challenging since you get questions from everybody at the client ecosystem, from junior developers to CIO and BA's to Business leaders. You constantly move from technically complex issues to IT Strategy, adoption, and other matters. Pretty demanding. If you get an out of town customer, then you will be traveling as well (generally at least 50% - can be more). Evenings can be quite lonely since you are the only person from Salesforce services at this customer site."
8066,4.0,If you don't work at HQ or a major hub might as well be working on the moon. There seems to be limited career progression and a 'Big Company' mentality in terms of how employees are managed day to day
8067,5.0,Large company with a lot of moving parts and a little bit of politics. Pretty standard stuff for a growing organization.
8068,3.0,"Poor management. They provide very little direction and expect you to work with 100% accuracy. When there are mistakes, management points the finger to everyone else."
8069,5.0,We run fast. A little tiring at times. But it's part of what I love too.
8070,5.0,I haven't found a con yet.
8071,5.0,"Aside from Sales, almost everyone at the company works in Downtown San Francisco. There are a lot of local employees who like that, but it's a substantial commute for the rest of us. Nonetheless, Salesforce is good enough to be worth commuting for."
8072,5.0,"You create your own way at Salesforce. You must be confident in your strengths and self aware of your weaknesses. They will not create that path for you, you have to do it. For some that is great, for others they need that plan laid out. Management can only help you so much in that. For a company growing this fast there are positions created everyday. You must have patience and savvy to find the next right role for yourself. Management will guide you, but you own your career. There isn't a defined path. You aren't always going to know all the options available. It's a very fast paced environment. For everyone to work together they must communicate well. This means seeking to understand, asking the right questions, and being flexible. In sales this requires confidence and humility, not arrogance. Egos can get in the way if they aren't controlled. This takes a team."
8073,4.0,"- Title Inflation. Too many CTOs and too many Architects - Cronyism has set in and the rot is spreading like a virus - After 4 years, effectively one takes a pay cut because of no stock options or all options have been vested - Top down. Used to be bottoms-up. - VPs of Engineering are aggressive and promote cronyism"
8074,5.0,"The commute to Palo Alto is not always ideal, but it's a small price to pay and there's always a few people from work on the train with you."
8075,5.0,Have all Bureaucracy a big company can have although it tries to avoid.
8076,3.0,"Crazy hours, few rewards, not a lot of support for women in leadership positions within product. Double standards across the organization."
8077,2.0,"IT org is a mess, most managers don't care about employees, no vision of follow through from leadership, everything is marketed as a success no matter how screwed up, honesty is not valued."
8078,5.0,"Would love to have some additional management training, but the one-on-one attention you get from leadership fills a lot of the gaps."
8079,5.0,"The pace is fast and can be overwhelming; Surprise projects tend to pop up; I work on a variety of teams, and context switching can lead to inefficiency"
8080,5.0,"Nothing bad to say - great place to work. Can be a lot of work, but I like the pace."
8081,3.0,"Some say salesforce is hyper-political, and in some departments it is. Under the new regime, you need to learn to manage up. If your boss is happy, life is pretty good. But don't plan on cracking those inner circles."
8082,4.0,Tries to lowball salaries; A little too full of itself (the Kool-Aid drinking can be a bit much); Rock-star CEO is both a pro and a con
8083,5.0,Big company politics Career growth may take some time.
8084,4.0,ratings dependent on other teams inputs
8085,4.0,A lot of work and not as much of a life/work balance.
8086,3.0,Smaller territories every year and it gets more difficult to meet your goals.
8087,5.0,Work life balance can be tough to achieve given how competitive people are to move up If you are in platform team otherwise its good
8088,5.0,The free snacks can challenge weight management.
8089,5.0,Senior levels involve a lot of politics.
8090,5.0,Mainly cold calls each day
8091,4.0,Inconsistent prioritization of features and resources
8092,4.0,"Product team is very political but I think that's the culture. I hear that the Sales group is pretty cutthroat. Doesn't provide things like free lunch, so it's hard to get engineers. Hard to get promoted unless you're friends with the right people. Most political place I've ever worked at. Also can feel like a boys club. Development for the main product is super slow."
8093,5.0,"Resources, supporting cast of pre sales and leadership are just as important as selling ability at salesforce, ratios are often fluctuating and can have a negative impact on individual sales impact."
8094,2.0,Hours are horrendous. The expectations are crazy. The goals and metrics are rarely clear.
8095,4.0,"SalesForce use to give more stock, and I know that other companies like Microsoft give more stock now. It's a company making a lot of profit, but doesn't really give it back to employees."
8096,5.0,None whatsoever. I love the place.
8097,5.0,#1 advice- get used to change!
8098,5.0,"Like I said depending who your team and what building is, you will either enjoy it or not."
8099,5.0,The Freshmen 15 is a tough way to start.
8100,5.0,"At times there is a lot of training, and products/webinars to push/attend."
8101,5.0,"Non of these are cons, per-se, but if they don't fit your personality then maybe the company isn't a fit for you? - fast-paced work environment - surrounded by overachievers, you constantly have to work hard to stay on top - no room for slacking off! - the product is constantly being updated and new things are added, processes change, etc - you have to be adaptable and a fast learner! [if you like sticking to the same routine year after year and working at a slow and steady pace, this may not be a fit for you] - no work-from-home options available for the majority of employees"
8102,5.0,"If aren't passionate about working here, it's going to be tough for you to stick."
8103,5.0,"-In this position you start work at 7:00 am, but the start time changes to 8:00 in the next position up."
8104,5.0,"There are very few cons to working at Salesforce. Nothing is perfect, there are definite day-to-day frustrations that come with any job but overall the quality of life is very high."
8105,5.0,"-There is a lot of kool-aid drinking, but it's no different than other 'hip' tech companies. -Sames problem as every sales company, patches shrink and quotas go up."
8106,1.0,"Some of the worst people managers I have ever worked with. It's a selfish, entitled, hero culture, no one cares about developing their teams. They are just looking for their own promotions and encourage others to only think about their own career advancement."
8107,3.0,Low base salaries for the industry and at SMB level can be very tough to find big deals. Not worth the money at this level but good for the experience.

8115,5.0,-sometimes you feel like you're drinking the kool-aid. (sometimes the kool-aid tastes really good!)
8116,5.0,"When you are a new hire, it feels like information overload. The learning curve is very sharp so you need to make sure you are constantly asking questions and gathering as much information as you can. If you someone who doesn't enjoy a competitive environment, this probably wouldn't be the best fit. Otherwise, be ready to work and enjoy building great relationships with your customers and co-workers."
8117,5.0,Open floor plan can be noisy at times.
8118,1.0,"No loyalty. I was an employee for nearly 7 years. Every year I received a stellar performance review, a good raise and bonus, and more stock. I even won awards for innovation and developing new ways to work. At one point it ""was"" a great place to work. In late 2013, I got a new manager. She made lots of comments about wanting people on her team who were ""young and hungry"". I turned 58 last year and assume I just got too old for her and the company. She eliminated my job, told me it wasn't personal, gave me a 6 week severance package and sent me on my way. Now, after 15 months of unemployment, I've lost my house, am living in my car and desperately trying to find a job. I had a great career that was ruined by this manager. HR let it happen knowing what a good employee I was. They just wanted to make my manager happy. For all their claims of being socially conscious and their philanthropic work, they certainly didn't care about me. The company is very calculated in their claims about promoting women. Right before I left, they had terminated at least 12 female VP's. Some were replaced with men."
8119,5.0,- No career path - you make your own career. This is hard if you are coming from other established companies - No fixed promotion cycles

8128,3.0,Stay away from sfdc IT dept and go to R&D only. Only handful of leaders are good in IT . IT lacks vision automation and has accumulated lot of technical debt .
8129,3.0,Salespeople churn and burn
8130,4.0,"Main cons are that it's a huge corporation and things get done sloowwwwly compared to startups and smaller companies. No matter what your role, it seems there's someone else doing the exact same thing in a different part of the company who is completely siloed from you, and it all gets very confusing. Projects take a long time to complete because a million people need to approve. Many people just don't reply to emails or show up to meetings because they're ""too busy."" Still, I think it's a 4-star workplace because you can easily do good work and get paid well without stressing yourself out too much. My work-life balance is pretty good here compared to smaller companies that are more stressful, so in that sense it's a win."
8131,3.0,"Very few AE's within the EBU hit their quota due to small territories and high quotas. There is high turnover in the EBU because reps aren't performing or making money, although the top performers can make 1M+. Quotas get raised 25% each year. Too many products to focus on. Poor culture in EBU with high pressure to perform on a monthly basis, although enterprise sales cycles can take 6-18 months."
8132,4.0,career advancement seems to be more political than merit based
8133,4.0,"-Lots of products on the platform (also a Pro) but as reps we often get pulled in a lot of different directions with promotions. It is imperative to take focused approaches to your selling so you don't get overwhelmed -This is quite a large company so it can sometimes feel as though you're a small fish in a big pond. However, the Chicago Hub still has that homegrown, startup feel to it"
8134,5.0,Need more growth from within
8135,1.0,"The politics kills me seriously. I was the most productive in the team, but since one of the unknown vendor approached my manger, told me that they know Marc Benioff. However, this vendor didn't meat our needs/expected price at all, so I turned-off. I was threatened and critisized during RFP, but unable to report because my team had serious bullying by my manager. I became lay-off later."
8136,5.0,No free lunch only snacks
8137,1.0,"1. Title egos and titles don't generally match competency of engineers. There used to be a lot of good engineers, but that has dwindled significantly. 2. Lot of politics. Watch out! 3. Technical growth will be stunted. Be prepared work with a lot of incompetent senior engineers. 4. Too much marketing hype about the product, but the products don't live up to expectation."
8138,5.0,It's hard to think of any! We need a barista in each remote office...? :)
8139,4.0,Smaller Territory and Comp plans really got bad fast.
8140,3.0,The political side of the company can become toxic. Must be willing to put in the hours to get any result
8141,5.0,Nothing I can tell you
8142,3.0,Huge variation in talent and leveling due to fast growth - opportunity for fast growth has now slowed and is determined more on time in role than talent. Managers often are tough - have had little people management training. Marketing plays backseat to sales in the organization.
8143,5.0,Takes time to get approval
8144,2.0,"There is a fair amount of politics and in many pockets there is a culture of blame rather than enablement. Hyper competitive, low level of quota attainment"
8145,5.0,I can't find any at this time
8146,4.0,Because of the speed of company growth people are being promoted into Manager and Director roles that quite honestly aren't ready to manage people.

8148,5.0,Sometimes the work is too much that it becomes a sweat shop
8149,5.0,There are no cons I could think of.
8150,3.0,"In Indianapolis, the company treats contractors as second class citizens. They cram them into over crowded rooms with little space to work. The rooms are hot and uncomfortable making it hard to work. Add in the personal hygiene of some workers and you get the idea. Exclusion from company events and support is the norm."
8151,2.0,"But everything is built on empty promises and software that doesn't actually work or get implemented. Salesforce was supposed to be a different kind of company, but it has become Oracle! We talk about customer success but no one actually cares about customer success. We care about signing big deals and pulling a fast one on the customer. This is going to catch up to the company eventually! Men get promoted if they are political, kiss up, and stab people in the back. Women get promoted if they sleep with the right men."
8152,1.0,"Products department has become extremely political. It's a shark tank with big battles over budget. No incentive for cross-product collaboration. Many managers only managing up while beating down their teams. Hard core HR culture from Oracle has seeped into Salesforce, so HR is purely on management's side and by no means neutral."
8153,3.0,"cult like, if not ""core"", less a priority to be able to be able to get things done"
8154,5.0,No cons as of yet.
8155,4.0,"Politics are rampant in many groups. Management often has its hands tied when making personnel decisions and eliminating poor performers or toxic individuals. Not an engineering or design focused culture, but one that is focused more on marketing and sales. The products reflect this, as they are layered with features and customizations designed to make sales. Anyone with a design or engineering focus will find the products uninspiring."
8156,5.0,"Politics, AE Skills, Segmentation, Time for Training"
8157,4.0,"Poor management is pervasive. Lack of leadership and commitment to big ideas creates gross inefficiencies, unclear expectations, and conflicting outcomes. Overly headquarter-centric in politics. The maintain an institutional arrogance that disrespects their competitors and creates overly idealistic strategies. Executive leadership tends to believe things get done because they want them to get done, without providing communication, support, or transparency in decisions."
8158,4.0,"This job is not easy, you really need to work hard, dedicate more time than you expect and work very fast."
8159,2.0,poor middle management cronyism huge culture shift and growing pains; company has become a mini-Oracle haves and have-nots in sales

8162,4.0,"Feature areas can be siloed, and your success depends a lot on the people around you (including manager, PM, and scrum team). Could be more agile."
8163,3.0,Stay away from sfdc IT dept and go to R&D only. Only handful of leaders are good in IT . IT lacks vision automation and has accumulated lot of technical debt .
8164,4.0,A bit of a boiler-room atmosphere given the unyielding focus on the monthly cadence.
8165,4.0,"Teams are very siloed. Head's down work environment. A lot of people do not participate in work events because they're too busy. If you're in services department, you won't have the best work/life balance"

8174,4.0,The pace of work can be extreme. You tend not to notice because it is an enjoyable environment but it feels like you have to put in lots of extra hours to survive
8175,5.0,All companies have growing pains.
8176,5.0,Nothing bad to say here
8177,5.0,Can't think of any worth noting.
8178,5.0,No real challenges so far other than things move fast and you have to keep pace. Not really a bad thing? Growing pains are evident here and there.
8179,2.0,Changing culture due to influx of Oracle Managers who have recently joined the company Micro-Management
8180,2.0,Shrinking territories and increased quotas. Monthly cadence and unrealistic expectations from lower management. Focus is on monthly deals and not long term strategic relationships outside of the enterprise group. Closing deals is more important that happy clients.
8181,3.0,Very hierarchical organization with more VPs than a bank <grin>. Always seemed very tense. Focus on adding new features rather than producing innovative solutions.
8182,5.0,Paid a little less than I expected as an intern. Maybe have a base salary which is at par with other Bay Area companies.
8183,5.0,"The company's growth is a great thing, but there are challenges with how this impacts corporate culture"
8184,1.0,"The stress level associated with any job at the Hillsboro office is through the roof. You will feel like you've aged a million years every day you work here. If you are a contractor, expect to be treated like a child, criminal and overall second class citizen. Training program seems to be okay IF you are a Salesforce direct hire...if you're a contractor you are given squat. The biggest problem is the support setup in general that Salesforce has and their customers ARE ABSOLUTE MONSTERS. These are the worst, most entitled people you will ever speak to and in part because of the smoke all The AEs blow up customers butts just to get a sale which are unrealistic. If you are hired at this location as a contractor...prepare to be set up for failure the moment you step foot in this office. For your sanity...work somewhere else."
8185,4.0,"Hyper competitive, low level of quota attainment"
8186,3.0,- Does not like to change very much. Likes to stick with old technology. - People sitting on temporary desks. Spacing issues. seriously salesforce????? - No pay increases per year. They don't promote you based on your performance. Some low performers getting promotions and other hard workers staying at the current positions for years.
8187,1.0,"As with any big company, the team you are on can drastically change your experience here but I am going to try to point out some of the general things. Also of note, before you read too much into the other reviews, take the time to notice how many of the 5 star reviews are can be summed up by ""great place to work but has growing pains"" or ""you get what you put in, slackers need not apply"". I will let you draw your own conclusion on why so many of these reviews sound like marketing message .... It doesnt look like ExactTarget understands that they are no longer a startup. The only people that thrive at ExactTarget are people that have no lives. 50+ hours of work a week is the norm and anyone that does less is considered a ""slacker"" as you might have seen in some of these other reviews. If you do the math, you'll realize that the decent paycheck, which is typically higher than the industry norm, ultimately falls woefully short when you look at how much you make an hour. As you work here, you come to find out that it is very much a cult mindset and you are either in or out. Job security comes from owning tribal knowledge of projects that are integrated in to the platform since documentation is apparently a running joke. There are many processes that have been implemented to ""streamline"" development but apparently the management style here is to implement ""solutions"" and ignore the results because the only thing that these processes have done is add one more point of failure to an already broken system. Contractors are treated as second class citizens. Its common knowledge. The way to get ahead is to brown nose and give up on life outside work. ET is founded on the principle that the reward for a job well done is an opportunity to do more. After the Salesforce acquisition morale and productivity have been at an all time low while frustrations and turn over have been on the other side of the scale."
8188,3.0,"As a big company, it was harder to get things done. Executives are not always in sync. It seems they prefer to hire from the outside rather than promote from within. Lots of changes going on these days."
8189,5.0,Nothing! Everything was super awesome!
8190,5.0,n/a. no cons from me
8191,3.0,Some unrealistic expectations for the sales teams. Smaller cities do not get the respect that the larger cities get in regards to resources.

8199,5.0,Not enough free food.
8200,1.0,"I've worked in the Salesforce ecosystem for over 10 years and I'm probably going to leave. I've been working at the company less than two months--albeit as a contract employee (although my title is technically ""Agency Temp--so sad, and the reason this even matters is one of the security questions when you call Global Services (the help desk) which I had to do 9 times in my first two days because of PC problems (and I'm not kidding.) is ""What is your title?"" I'm not really a person keen on titles but ""Agency Temp"" doesn't describe my expertise or skill set and it certainly made me feel like a second class citizen. Maybe it's because I'm not a big company person. I also heard ""contractors don't get desks"" Nice. That's not legal. So buyer beware. My agency on-boarding was also horrific. My commute into the city is terrible. I love SFDC and have made my living around it. I don't want to sour on it and think I can make a bigger impact at a client. I am also surrounded by two extremes--other Agency Temps and super stars who have been there for years who stick together. In addition, my boss is remote, extremely busy and they ""sold to me"" is the dog they start everyone on which has stalled for a year and half."
8201,5.0,too hard to leave salesforce
8202,4.0,2017 goals are causing a lot of culture shifts Could be Oracle 2 given the amount of ex-Oracle hires since 2013
8203,5.0,- Start up like culture with shifting priorities - Frequent product acquisitions
8204,4.0,"Growth is about increasing sales capacity, but sales supporting roles and admin roles are being squeezed. Since there are already too many executives, career progression has slowed down. Similarly and due to increased pressure from the market to show better profit margins, salary increases are minimal; stock options have been reduced."
8205,5.0,"Very large organization can be difficult to navigate, pressure to succeed can burn some people out, Portland site does not have much room for career development"
8206,1.0,"There is a culture of sexual harassment within Sales and Marketing. It seems to be tacitly approved by management, so women don't bother to report it and male executives treat this place like a playground on which to prey on young women. Makes it hard to do your job well."
8207,3.0,"A bunch of Oracle execs were hired over the last 3 years, and they have been busy replicating the Oracle culture here. The worst changes to the company have come in at the beginning of 2015. Quality Engineering was de-prioritized across the R&D organization. Many of the QE execs have been given different roles (I am not complaining about this. To be fair, many of these so-called QE execs should be fired. Do we really need 10 VPs in Quality Engineering? QE heads are now reporting to development managers. The road ahead points to converting all teams to Engineering teams. So if you are a QE trying to get a job, look elsewhere. Do not listen to the drivel from the recruiters. QE ROLE IS ENDING AT SALESFORCE! Added to this, the conflicting priorities are ever increasing in this company. R&D is at its 3rd attempt to re-write the UI, and make it adaptive at the same time. The so-called Salesforce 1 app was a disaster. The next attempt is starting in 2015. Although there is not a lot of hope for it, many of the ""leaders"" driving this will surely make hay via promotions and stock grants."
8208,1.0,"For being a tech company, this place could not keep anyone in IT for longer than 2 years, it seemed. Salesforce has a ridiculous hierarchy that is rather militant in the way it handles internal communications (""My door is always open; however, you better not come to me before person a, b, c, and d""). There is 0 transparency although they preach this in every pointless meeting they make you sit through. This company caters heavily to the Sales side of business, and no where else. If you are IT in any sense of that side of business, then you can expect to be held to your best performing day for your entire career no matter how much of an outlier that day was, if you prove to be competent with what you do you can expect to be overloaded with work enough for those who are not, and then held to their expectations on top of your own. Oh, and those people will get promoted before you, because you are too ""valuable"" to move from your spot. And you can never expect to hear what you do right; every 1:1 you have with management is everything that you could possibly be doing better, always. No thanks, no 'atta-boys, nothing. You think you have co-workers in other departments? The people you assist are your companies User's that you support? Maybe these co-workers/users are your future friends/buddies? No. You have customers. And you treat them as such at all times. Your co-workers for the first few months of being hired are pretty great typically, until the vibe of this company is finally realized; which leads them into the cutthroat, every (wo)man for his/herself environment that management breeds. As a cherry on the top; Salesforce has this underlying community called femmeforce. Now this could be innocent, and it could potentially do a lot of great things; however this is not what it is being used for and many of the current management are women who are extremely active in this community for the wrong reasons. In our office 90% of the people who are leaving/being bullied out are male, and 70-80% of the new hires are women. The obvious preferential treatment, and the lack of others who care enough to do anything about it is ulimately why I left this company. I performed in the top 5 of a 40+ member team consistently across all stats; closures, professionalism, ""customer"" satisfaction, SLA; however, I was still offered an ultimatum: a severance package that is really hard to look away from, or the promise of an official write up that would not go the way I wanted, just because I was male working under a radical feminist. That is not a joke, and not an exaggeration."
8209,5.0,"A couple processes have been caught up with red tape throughout my time here, but that will happen with a big company. Overall, I have few complaints about my time with the company."
8210,2.0,too many to list here
8211,4.0,"Nothing as such,great comany.not too flexible hours"
8212,5.0,Corporate messaging changes almost every year
8213,3.0,"Highly political environment. Not open or embrace a "" different"" way to solve problems or approach challenges."
8214,3.0,"Low moral, if you don't live in San Francisco they act like you live on Mars"
8215,1.0,"The top level management like directors , program managers are pretty immature and behave unprofessionally. They poke their nose in matters where they are not supposed to. Obvious they dont have lot of work to do and just jump in every meeting and talk nonsense.Consulting for salesforce has been painful. They have irrelevant personal conversations in the meetings which annoys consultants from other firms. Still they are behaving like a start up company and never being matured. The height of immaturity is when they make fun of other company's boss and consultants right in front of them."
8216,4.0,"Very political, more interested in number and looking like people are doing thier jobs then actually focusing on ROI and moving the company forward."
8217,5.0,"Your manager/territory/account list will have a huge impact on your success, so relationships are key to protect yourself on those factors."
8218,5.0,I've been here for 6 months and thankful every day for being here.
8219,4.0,"too slow in technological updates, particularly in infrastructure side though it is improving a lot now"
8220,4.0,"Little room for advancement in some of the sub-clouds, unless you worked at whatever company got acquired to create that cloud. Can be hard to move up or onto different teams of your own volition. Constant reorganizations of mid-level management make it hard to get established as a newer employee."
8221,4.0,Very subjective quota measurement based on creating opportunities - can be completely gamed by having your Account Executive tip you off to conversations they are having and then letting you enter the opportunity in
8222,5.0,There is literally nothing bad I can say. Salesforce is an amazing place to work.
8223,2.0,unnatural sales pressure to sell subscriptions- ACV sales reps do not typically stay at salesforce more than 2 years company has grown via acquisitions and many of the acquired cultures clash Not Stable- accounts and managers are constantly changing making this a challenging place to stay long term and build a career.
8224,5.0,Not an IPO. You're not going to clean up on exploding stock options.
8225,4.0,- Engineering/tech are not the main focus
8226,5.0,"Salesforce is a large company, but you can find an entrepreneurial spirit and freedom in many of the smaller divisions in the company."
8227,3.0,"Long hours, office culture, politics. The Chicago office needs attention, the politics involved in getting promotions runs rampant. There were multiple male sales leaders in the last year let go due to inappropriate office relations with females and younger employees. Need more women leaders here, they let one of the best female sales leaders go as well that a lot of women looked up to as a mentor and leader. They pit you and your colleagues against each other when interviewing for a sales promotion and makes it awkward and uncomfortable. They also hardly give any thanks or recognition."
8228,5.0,There is no cons for working here.
8229,5.0,No Free Lunch for Engineer
8230,4.0,"The rush of work is heavy and intense, and can feel a little like being thrown into the deep end to sink or swim."

8232,4.0,sometime feels too sales centric
8233,5.0,None I can think of
8234,3.0,"Because Salesforce is growing so fast – doubling its workforce and revenue over two years – many things get lost in the shuffle. Some teams have crushing workloads, while others are virtually forgotten. The prevailing infrastructure of the company is a parochial network of vice presidents operating independently. This leads to disconnection, and occasionally chaos. Teams duplicate work, work in contradictory directions, and compete pointlessly. Territoriality for budget and resources is rampant. There are no centralized checks and balances. If you have a bad or unethical warlord, you may be asked to do things that are counterproductive or even hurtful. The patchwork of fiefdoms across the company is so disconnected that many teams are unaware of similar teams within the company. Efforts to organize or connect strategies are met with resistance and sometimes hostility. A chief strategy officer with a team of connected project managers could address this, but many VPs don't want accountability. The result is work that doesn't rise above mediocrity. Salesforce is a great company comprised of dozens of mediocre companies. Those mediocre companies don't want to connect and be great because their leaders don't want to lose status. Once you see that you can't unsee it. Many workers grow cynical as a result. The famed ""Ohana"" (Hawaiian for family) doesn't penetrate the 300-yard stare of hardened coworkers who don't say hello in elevators."
8235,5.0,Nothing to complain about re this company
8236,5.0,I have had a very positive experience so far.
8237,5.0,Constant pressure to follow corporate message
8238,4.0,Not many . overall good place to work
8239,1.0,"Micro managment, Boiler room mentality, Pipe generation is what they care about. Too many people calling on the same account. Your litterly fighting over the same customers. Can't work from home. No training offered, you have to train your self on everything. Onboarding is non excisting. High turnover in Small Business Sales. Customers are totally feedup with so many AE's calling on the same account. Salesforce does not believe in their own Ohana in smallbiz. There is no trust and managment don't care about anything but Pipe generation and sales."
8240,4.0,Lack of vision to push through large infra projects at the senior management level
8241,5.0,have to go home sometimes
8242,5.0,"Salesforce app culture sometimes make things very interrupt-driven and /or seems like doing anything requrires inputting a lot of detail into the system. I get it from a macro level, but it can be a lot"
8243,4.0,Structural Change can be hard to keep up with and the fast pace can be challenging at times.
8244,3.0,"The way we plan and deliver projects are painfully slow and the focus on output, rather than outcome is promoting damaging behaviors. We are force to used in-house tools for planning and tracking our project work in the teams, they are so lacking functionality, and fixing that is a low priority."
8245,4.0,"Senior leadership doesn’t always make good decisions, don’t always act on values and principles. Constant re-orgs."
8246,5.0,"Working as marketing Cloud AE you are a co-prime. Some core AE’s are bossy, but most are very professional."
8247,4.0,"Over the last year or so, there is an influx of people from a certain software behemoth. While it is understood that any leadership change will bring with it a new paradigm, I do believe that sometimes people are given more importance than people that have built the systems and been hugely successful, just because they come from a certain company. As a consequence, sometimes, either attrition of domain experts is high or there are growing signs of disapproval with how the management thinks."
8248,5.0,"There are opportunities for improvement, which is not different from other companies. The difference with Salesforce compared to my former employer is that there is opportunity to make a big impact at Salesforce, which opens the door for doing business better and reduces the red tape."
8249,5.0,I haven't experienced many negatives throughout my time at Salesforce but I understand it's a different experience for each employee. There is of course a substantial amount of change but it's part of the natural evolution of a company innovating and growing at this rate.
8250,5.0,Being a remote worker can be tough as you are a bit on your own to build relationships in a fast paced environment.
8251,5.0,"This is a hard-working atmosphere, but undeniably rewarding. You will get back what you put in (and more) at salesforce.com."
8252,5.0,"We have grown quickly, but it doesn't seem like things are out of control. I have worked for start ups that grew too quickly and felt like the company was ahead of itself. ExactTarget seems to be in control every step of the way. We need to ensure this continues."
8253,5.0,All Levels: Company is getting bigger - not as big as SAP or Oracle - but no longer a 'startup'. At Executive Level: The old-timers who have been around for 5-10 years and 'acquired execs' run the show. Very difficult for anyone else to rise up the ranks. Not enough space.
8254,5.0,"The development process can be cumbersome. The build breaks very often, and grabbing one bad changelist that breaks an essential component of the build can totally nuke your productivity for a whole day. Onboarding time takes 3-6 months since there are so many moving parts and a lot of different languages involved in development. No parking at the offices in HQ since they're all in downtown San Francisco."
8255,5.0,"You better be organized, driven and accountable. People fail fast here."
8256,5.0,No real cons. There is so much opportunity in the market that it's difficult to get to it all. Quality people that have to ramp quickly when they come on board.
8257,4.0,Not an easy path to promotion.
8258,5.0,big company so you can get lost
8259,2.0,"Very stressful job where are you asked to wear many hat at the same time. Also, be prepare to be micromanaged."
8260,5.0,Fast pace of revenue growth can be a source of stress at times.
8261,4.0,monthly cadence on quota can be stressful
8262,3.0,"Licensing and contracts are ""heavy handed"" focusing on the interests of Salesforce and largely disrespecting the interests of the customer. A stark contrast to the very public and even aggressive ""Social Fairness and Inclusion"" mantra of the CEO and most others in senior leadership."
8263,3.0,Work-life balance is a major issue
8264,1.0,"Having served at the company for over 10 years, I must say that in my last 2 years there, things seem to have taken a downward turn. I am sure attrition rates are at an all time high, even outside Sales. There are several very good middle managers, however the bad and untrained seem to be taking over, with several long time employees being pushed out once it is determined they either make too much money or don't ""tow the line"". This may be the result of becoming a large company, however what really stings is all the ""good for the world"" BS that marketing spews out, when in reality it is about the cash."
8265,5.0,Hard to move across teams compared to other companies
8266,5.0,Lots of work since the bar is set high.
8267,5.0,It can feel like a large company at times with red tape.
8268,5.0,Doesn't match FANG Companies compensation
8269,5.0,Very competitive and lot of politics
8270,3.0,Cut throat and political. Hard to get promoted. All depends on your boss and their ability to bring you along. Everything revolves around sales.
8271,1.0,"Salesforce talks about the aloha spirit and embracing all new employees from acquired companies. This is not the case. Salesforce disrespected me as a member of the existing management team during our acquisition time, but they had no issues in demanding an excessive amount of my time for information during the acquisition process."
8272,1.0,Unfortunately the hiring managers don’t practice the company values. If you are a minority especially African American don’t bother applying for any senior positions . These jobs go to hiring managers friends who are white men and white women no matter how qualified you are. The recruiters are biased and they already know who the hiring managers “friends “ will be filling the positions. Minorities are only interviewed for EEOC statistics tracking. It’s a joke.
8273,5.0,Time zone difference between HQ and other sites
8274,4.0,None at this time.
8275,5.0,I haven't found a con yet
8276,5.0,Lot of travel depending upon client needs

8280,5.0,"We are now almost 40K, so it helps to be good at navigating people and get your EQ skills on."
8281,5.0,Sometimes feel disconnected being remote. Job opportunities for remote employees more difficult
8282,4.0,Salesforce operates using proprietary frameworks that are only used within salesforce. There is quite a bit of learning curve and take a while to master. This can slow down your growth prospects since you would have to spend a couple years simply to understand the ins and outs of the environment while at the same time competing with the engineers who have been around for way longer and have what is called the 'tribal knowledge'
8283,4.0,none I can think of
8284,5.0,"Be prepared to work hard. It is not a ""con"" but the truth"
8285,5.0,Lunches or Dinner are not provided
8286,5.0,No cons at this moment
8287,5.0,"Working in a large company always has its challenges, but overall I have no major complaints."
8288,5.0,- Not necessarily a con but a little disengaged from the rest of Salesforce in other buildings--employees need to put in an extra effort to be/feel part of the main Salesforce office around Chicago - Lots of change organizationally but office leadership is mindful of how this impacts employees and is actively working to make these changes more understandable and transparent

8298,2.0,"FY20 Kicked off with a THUD for many Salesforce Employees who were given ZERO merit raises. HR said this was due to the enoromous growth of the company and the rebalancing of title, etc. I would expect to see a large change over once all those final FY19 checks are cashed in April."
8299,1.0,"I mean...it's hard to know where to start but I'll try to do my best. First, a lot of people talk about career and promotions - and how there's little to know transparency about the process, nepotism is rampant and the like. The company knows this, which is why ES has done away with giving performance reviews. Now, instead of being clear on what exactly you need to do to move up the chain, they're putting this on you. The result is that many people get promoted solely for political/favoritism , and people who actually have technical skills can get lost if there is no one mentoring them on how to play the game. And as other people have mentioned, employees do get rated by their managers every year, but they never see the results of their evaluation. The typical ES response to this will be ""Salesforce is not for everyone"" - but this should not take the place of transparency around the promotion process, especially in a company that touts itself on being transparent in every other way. The whole situation is a really messed up way of dealing with the fact that there are too many talented and driven people here. Work life balance, especially in regional roles, is nonexistent. During a regional rotation, I was actually paid less than my San Francisco salary per our mobility policies, but I was expected to lead projects in San Francisco AND the regional location. The result was 15-18 hour days, 6 days per week. Even though I discussed the concerns I had with my manager, their response was the typical ""Maybe Salesforce just isn't for you."" The situation did finally get better after I sought legal advice, and realized that this type of working structure was actually illegal per the local environment. However, it was clear that the escalation was seen as politically incorrect, and the regional rotation quickly became a dead end with no career growth or development. I was lucky enough to find a team in San Francisco that was willing to take me as a way out, but I share this as a cautionary tale for anyone considering taking on a similar role. Make sure you have a good local attorney, as many teams at Salesforce are predatory, and see the rotational experience as a way to get you to take on more for less money - they will retaliate against you if you try to escalate concerns about your work environment (and on the other side, try getting anyone in San Francisco to take a call before 8am or after 5pm, and people will act like you're crazy - it's a complete double standard). Salesforce is going to start offering more and more roles like this outside of San Francisco to reduce costs, so be sure you know what you're getting yourself into and how you'll be supported if you take one of these on. Operations are a complete mess with many groups doing the same thing, each one trying to assert themselves. Ever since I've been here, there seems to be a focus on wellness, though this gets rebranded time and again as different initiatives. The end result is that people are super driven from 8-5, but cut corners so they can make it to that 5:30pm yoga class. I'm not saying people should work 24/7, but this is an example of how Salesforce and its culture often embody mixed messages (grow grow grow but make sure you have a balance). The result is a lot of groups who say ""This isn't my problem/I'm not owning it/Find someone else to talk to."" In a matrixed environment, this becomes really frustrating - especially as the company has gotten so much bigger. Ultimately, the Company is becoming larger and more bureaucratic - many employees are not receiving raises this year because the company wants to focus on bottom line growth at the expense of its people. At some point over the last 10 years, my day became 100% focused on managing the politics as opposed to creating value and focusing on work I enjoy. Because of this, I've decided to leave Salesforce after a long ride. It's bittersweet, but kind of like that song - ""You don't have to go home, but you can't stay here""; the writing is on the wall in terms of where this company is going - the culture has is getting more and more eroded with the growth. As a final word of warning, I will just encourage all potential candidates to take Salesforce marketing with a grain of salt. Salesforce is one of the only companies I know of that has an internal marketing team who is tasked with trying to tell you how you should feel about the company. Yes, it's true - they have done a lot of great things, but usually the motivation behind it is much more about showing how this initiative is part of the Salesforce brand, as opposed to genuinely providing assistance to someone or some organization that needs help."

I had a call with some random person and I honestly didn't know about this. They came back 2 days later and said my employment was ended as of that day. Turns out it was a check for $65 from 1997 when I lived in a different state but was paid and rectified. Not very Ohana like!!!!!!!!
8336,5.0,"The culture is that of a big company, and success here is what you make of it. Nothing will be spoonfed, and it is up to the individual to sink or swim. Training is barebones(so seek out resources, and self motivate yourself to learn!), and many sales environments are hyper competitive. The organization is so big that there are redundant processes and internal politics, meaning that success here requires excellent externally facing and internally facing skills(or perhaps an opportunity to develop both for those starting their careers). For a company of this size, I don't think it is possible to avoid the aforementioned cons; that said, new employees who have only worked down or mid-market will need to adjust to a big company work environment, and won't receive much in the way of guidance as to how best to accomplish this."

This is obviously not the case with all departments - but my rating reflects my horrible experience with my department that has been embroiled in chaos for more than a year, with no end in sight. This department is central enough that the dysfunction here, will eventually result in a bad decisions for all other teams that interact with it. The leader of this department has created an unhealthy work culture, where people do things because of fear. The leader openly chides senior leadership in public for small infractions, and does not accept dissent. They have openly punished individuals for speaking up. The working style has become uninspiring because pomp and show are prioritized over true value creation - this is demonstrated by the fact that the top achievements of the department as highlighted by the leader themselves are theoretical frameworks, and not actual proven methodologies. There are many smart people on the team, but the leader has narrowed in to their insecurities and manipulates them to make sure they only do and say things the leader wants. Otherwise, they are very efficient on getting rid of people who do not “please” the leader one way or another. HR is kind but plays the therapist role rather than a facilitator. At least 25 people in our department have talked with HR. All we’ve heard is “Awww” and “it’ll get better, we will coach them” for the last 6 months. Can’t say we haven’t tried. We can’t all switch teams and ultimately it is the company’s responsibility to weed out bad leaders. It is not just people suffering (though of course Salesforce will say people are important) but business is suffering because we have a whole department that is wasting money, talent and resources - and no amount of escalation has yielded anything."
8382,5.0,Nothing bad to say here
8383,4.0,"After my long tenure and many Dreamforce conferences, I'm nearly fried. To say the culture is fast paced and the focus is always changing is an understatement. The reason Salesforce always seems on top, and chasing the latest trend, and in the press, is because employees are expected to run harder, carry more, cheer loudly, and pivot constantly. It's the world's biggest startup in behavior. But at the same time, with the recent influx of top career sales leaders from Oracle and what appears to be a board-level mandate for doubling revenue, employees are being asked to do even more with even less, fill higher quotas with smaller territories, less help, and the big company bureaucracy is rearing it's ugly head. Worse still is the politics. When you hire a bunch of smart, aggressive people, and put them in an environment of outsized expectations, throw in a bunch of re-orgs and changing management, and sprinkle with uncertainty and constantly changing priorities, you inevitably get people back stabbing each other and throwing others under the bus to appear smarter and more worthy of promotion. The few at the top will get very, very rich. The rest will lose the sense of personal ownership and start to wonder why they've given up health and family"

Meanwhile, there's zero knowledge management to speak of -- we are literally incessantly filling out shared docs with the same information multiple times outside of the CRM. and everyone on the account team loses the plot. Who would have thunk? Salesforce is cost cutting in an effort to reach profitability. Goodbye parties, offsites, and non customer-facing travel. Benefits aren't cheap -- I'm paying well over $400/mo. for mine. It's been observed that they are systematically pushing workers 40+ out of the business to hire less experienced / new grads for less -- a ""best practice"" of private equity companies that seems to be catching on like wildfire in tech. Last but not least, at a company that espouses the values that it does, I am surprised that so many offsite events and outings include a ridiculous amount of drinking. Not ONCE has our team done a group volunteering outing or something to serve our community (and I'm at HQ in San Francisco). Instead, every time I go out with my sales colleagues it turns into some weird game of chicken of who can drink the most and still function the next day. Honestly, it's pathetic.

Nearly every AE was recruited & led to believe that ""although your base salary appears low - you will make that up in overtime."" AE's work 50+ hours. This isn't an expectation - it's simply about owning your responsibilities required to do a good job for our customers. In the past, logging honest hours hasn't been an issue - AE's logged hours according to the work put in. This year however, it is ""48 hours or less...if you are logging more than 50 hours, you're not efficient"" .... This is concerning b/c it represents a subtle undertone of apathy to AE's. We were recruited under the notion we would be allowed to log the hours we worked. If the company is moving away from paying hourly, then the salaries should adjust accordingly - b/c this was the #1 negotiation tactic used by Salesforce recruiters to lowball base salaries. But again, the bigger concern here is how it makes AE's feel. We assume Salesforce looks out for our best interest, especially those putting in the extra hours to get the job done. It's one of the reasons Salesforce has been successful - we have a culture of execution."

Timing, territory and talent (in that order) determine success, but I’ve watched too many qualified candidates be “coached out,” while managers can’t staff a full team. Also the pay is low compared to our competition."
8420,2.0,"No work life balance Capped on hours you can log Constantly told you can't travel during business hours but also cannot log those hours traveling (illegal?) Management will mock you for giving feedback even if they say it's ""anonymous"" No negotiation power Highly underpaid when comparing to the competition Entire sales team is under quota over 50% of the months"
8421,5.0,- Some major technical debt. It's been acknowledged and work is being done to reduce it - which is more than what most places can say - but no enough. -Leave policy for most levels involves accruing days off and is kinda terrible.
8422,4.0,"""Fillers"". I call them ""fillers"" because that's what they are...people that were hired in haste to simple fill roles in an organization that is growing so fast, they had to be hired quickly. While they may have gone through multiple rounds of interviews, it seems there are many execs that got through that shouldn't have and are just filling a role in the org chart. And they don't do s*&^. They may have had extremely successful positions at other companies, but Salesforce isn't like other companies. They only slow you down...so if you're smart and have your i's dotted and t's crossed, just go over them and it's not really looked down upon. Tomorrow. You're only as good as the deal you have committed tomorrow. Doesn't matter if you're at 200% of quota for the year 6 months into it ...that actually only amplifies what is expected of you. It's a con...but in reality...it's also not too bad...unless you're in a Sales role that isn't an AE (i.e. SE) because you're capped. Salesforce has the SE's I've ever come across in the industry, and I don't think they're treated as fairly as they should be. Marketeering. This is a new issue at Salesforce... It used to be the case that marketing & PM were in line and no one sold on futures. Over the past 12 months, that has changed...moving closer to an Oracle-like model where the vision is pitched and then they try to build it. Equity. I'm not sure who is getting it, but it isn't long term sales people. Seekingalpha? They couldn't be more wrong. Granted, the ESPP program is fantastic, but once you get beyond entry level, it would be nice to see something. It can be disheartening to hear RVP's (in 2012 I swear they only brought in people as RVP's...""What? You're an RVP of WHAT? And have no reports?!?!?"") and other new employees talking about selling their RSU's or options when they haven't really done anything for the company yet and you've committed the better part of a decade. Commit. This is probably the biggest ""Con"" at Salesforce if you're an AE or in sales. Salesforce is an accurate machine...it really is...based on the subscription model, a great portion of deferred rev is already established and known...but they want your sales opps just as accurate and mgmt will force or override you on your deals if you think differently. Territory. Don't come to Salesforce thinking you'll be able to pick and choose. It was picked over 5 years ago. You'll more than likely get something you don't want. End of discussion. While it seems like it should be the biggest ""con"", it's not. Because everything I listed in the ""Pros"" section means you will constantly have something new and innovative to sell to that minuscule territory you have that no one else can. I mentioned in the ""Pros"" section that some of the long-termers (those that have been around 10+ years) are one of the best things about the company. They ARE. There are also a handful of high level execs that just need to go...they don't do anything...they show up at meetings and say hello and leave... and you better keep your mouth shut. It sucks. Because at one time they were amazing. Now, just awful."
8423,5.0,Salesforce.com is getting big. It may not be what you're looking for.
8424,3.0,"crazy political; not all for one and one for all, but rather, all looking out for number one; sales culture has made everyone else into 2nd class citizens; higher-than-average comp doesn't pay for how embittered one becomes as a result of this environment"
8425,5.0,"Every-day, the company moves away from it's small, entrepreneurial spirit and towards the a structure similar to Oracle. It's not too bad, and some things are necessary to continue such enormous growth but it would be nice to see them blaze their own trail instead of completely following Oracle's blue-print"
8426,5.0,Heavily sales-driven which can impact the culture to a degree and cause some political strife within the company. High turnover in account management and some struggles with customer service given recent acquisitions and finding alignment between all the companies
8427,5.0,No PetForce in NYC office :(
8428,5.0,"Salesforce is a HUGE product, which is fabulous but if you have no experience with it you have a bunch of onboarding to do. I think the organization is still figuring out how best to onboard everyone with so many complex layers of product and employee situation - also doing this while the company and product shifts in growth. It is daunting, but feels stable."
8429,5.0,I don't see much cons about this wonderful company. I wish the management continue supporting its employees the same way it does now.
8430,5.0,Territories are getting shrunk as we grow
8431,5.0,The hiring process was frustrating due to a lack of communication from the recruiter.
8432,5.0,It's a big company and there is so much to take in. It's on the individual to ensure they're intentional with what they do and seeking out the right opportunities
8433,1.0,No diversity in sales- the website makes the company look diverse and it is not at all unfortunately Poor middle management that plays favorites and favors typical male frat boy. Toxic sales culture of people that constantly undercut one another. No one tries to help new employees and everyone is more concerned with making themselves look better and squeezing others out. So many red accounts and failed implementations!! I’ve never heard of such a thing! Constant change- I had 3 middle managers in one year!
8434,1.0,Many in leadership positions have no business being in leadership positions. Company is growing so fast that they’re promoting people to fill seats rather than evaluate them as a leader. “Ohana” culture seems to be a facade. Trust is an issue as I was misled during interview process and have been since I’ve become an employee.
8435,4.0,"As I’ve only just started all of my comments are about first impressions, so please take that into consideration. I have gotten the feeling that the company has grown so fast it is suffering from some growing pains. By all means a good problem to have, but it means process workflows can be a bit clunky."
8436,5.0,None as of now. It's too new to tell.
8437,2.0,"Things have changed now since 2 years or so.. lots of bureaucracy, heir achy politics at grass root level.. no more an innovative and open kind of culture, its turning more into legacy kind of companies. If you think you can thrive in such an environment this is the place !"
8438,5.0,"Being apart of such a big company, it is sometimes hard to see or feel the impact you make. I'll always feel like a small fish in a very, very big pond."
8439,5.0,- Very fast paced - Growing geographic footprint is hard to overcome during travel freezes
8440,5.0,- Lots of tasks and training for new employees such that you do not get a chance to focus much on your work in the first couple of months.
8441,4.0,"Most jobs are in office, not remote, there are exceptions, but if you're not on a remote team it will be difficult to get that benefit. Compensation is above average, but not what HR tells you during interviews. 2 weeks of PTO a year with holidays. It can be very easy to get stuck in the role you're in. They advertise that its easy to find new roles within the company and get promoted into them, from my experience this isn't true. There is a lot of red tape and politics. You can pigeon hole yourself based on what team and department you're joining."
8442,3.0,Promotion consistency Career opportunities Ability to take time off and disconnect (great PTO benefit though) General disconnect of senior management from overall department and day-to-day responsibilities
8443,5.0,"There are some things that happen when you grow too quickly, some structure has been lacking but at least it is always acknowledged and worked on. For example, it took them a while to fine tune some the HR applications that we use internally."
8444,5.0,"- Cronyism seeping in. Growth is tied to how much you suck up to your management - Disagreements while encouraged on the surface, are dealt with serious repercussions covertly - Work-life balance is eroding thanks to inept managers - Top-down directives to teams is demoralizing"
8445,5.0,Managing work / life balance is a challenge when you love your job.
8446,5.0,-Corporate politics (not sure if this can be avoided at a big company) -naysayers when trying to make career moves that are outside the norm
8447,5.0,None that I can think of
8448,5.0,"This is a very large company, so it is easy to get ""lost"" within its many layers. They provide a high level of autonomy, which is great if you like it, but you may find yourself ""rudderless"" if you don't thrive in that environment. Onboarding is a long process due to the plethora of products Salesforce offers..."
8449,5.0,Make sure that everyone at home is ok with the travel as it can be hard to predict...
8450,5.0,Nothing yet - keep up the great work!
8451,5.0,None that come to mind
8452,5.0,Challange with team to provide for company a best results
8453,5.0,"The pace can be overwhelming. Moving initiatives forward can be particularly challenging given excessive competing priorities. These, in themselves, aren't ""cons"" but can be considered as such by those who have been lulled into complacency in traditional work environments."
8454,2.0,Lied to about job expectations and performance during hiring/onboarding process upper-management focuses on making money rather than helping businesses My expectations we're very high when I accepted this role...now I wish I never did
8455,4.0,"That being said, the vision and values don't necessarily always translate down to middle management levels. Many orgs (specifically marketing, but I've heard sales as well) are full of politics, mud slinging and power grabs. Senior leadership seems to acknowledge this recently, however there are no consequences for the people that perpetuate this type of environment. Toxic employees who produce results in their job are protected, even when multiple complaints are surfaced through the appropriate channels."
8456,5.0,Can't think of anything negative whatsoever.
8457,5.0,"I don't have a lot of negative things to say. I know we are in a period of rapid growth, just remember to keep the focus on the customer."
8458,5.0,- Can be hard to step away from the job (despite emphasis about integrating work and non-work activities and preventing burnout) but it's ultimately a personal choice to do so and can only improve job performance
8459,5.0,Motivation to do more is sometimes lacking for the department
8460,4.0,extremely sales and quota driven
8461,5.0,"Sometimes pressure to be billable is in conflict with other values-- volunteer time, etc."
8462,5.0,So far I have no complaints
8463,5.0,Not as flexible to work from home in my role.
8464,5.0,Hard for under performers to get fired.
8465,5.0,Can't think of any right now.
8466,5.0,I cannot think of anything. I am proud to be part of Salesforce's journey into the next phase of its leadership & growth.
8467,5.0,"Not many cons to be had, some may find the volume of work to be difficult to handle though. Work pace is fast and sometimes chaotic."
8468,5.0,"Tough to say much here. Like any company that's been acquired, it may prove tough to keep the same office culture, but the people here seem committed to doing everything in their power to make it happen."
8469,5.0,"SF is changing as it needs different structure and methods to grow and hit it's revenue goals. Some of the change is necessary, but there is concern that the baby may be going with the bath water."
8470,2.0,"Unfortunately as the company has grown exponentially, it has gotten that big company mentality and politics. From a sales standpoint, goals have become unreasonable and territories have shrunk ridiculously. Ask what percentage of the reps are making quota. I suspect company wide it is less than 25% but management would never say. Very hard to make money these days at SFDC. Voluntary turnover in 2013 was insane (sales reps). Leadership from Oracle coming over in herds pushing Oracle mentality...not good unless you like that kind of thing."
8471,5.0,- Fast growth means less time to stop and smell the roses and revel in accomplishments.
8472,5.0,"Sales - its all about your territory and timing. Many customers are ""sold out"" on the CRM front - and it's VERY difficult to hit your quota without a substantial amount of your sales coming from CRM. It's not normal to hit your # if you don't sell any CRM.. .so just understand what your getting into."
8473,2.0,"- If you come from an acquisition, Salesforce isn’t going to pay you as well as they pay their internal employees. Even if you are doing the same exact job as someone inside Salesforce, you will probably be making significantly less than what a core employee will be making. It was extremely frustrating and completely demeaning to hear all the hype and news about how Salesforce employees are so happy with their compensation and how Salesforce is making strides towards equal pay. Apparently, acquired company employees are not part of that equation and we do not hold as much value and shouldn’t be treated as equals…ridiculous. I asked for a compensation change in order to match or even come close to the pay of my peers within the Salesforce organization but was told that Salesforce does not have enough internal data to justify a compensation change. Essentially, there was no proof at Salesforce that I was worth a compensation change. This blew my mind because when you first hire someone, you have no proof internally that they are worth the salary that you are going to pay them. What you do instead is evaluate their past experiences and then you determine what is fair pay based on their experiences, skills, and the job that they are doing. You have no internal data or proof in that situation. If you acquire a company, yes, you have no Salesforce data to prove that an employee is worth a certain salary but you acquired a product that you clearly thought had value and the people who helped to create that product are not worth a compensation change because you don't have enough data? I had been working for the acquired company for almost a year, but all of that was meaningless because if you're acquired, it seems like you're not truly a ""Salesforce employee"" and being paid fairly is not something that applies to you. - Our entire acquisition process was a complete mess. My team and I essentially had to operate “as normal” which was completely impossible given that all of our management and the rest of the company were trying to figure out the acquisition themselves. We were lost in the transition, did not have managers for quite some time, and were essentially left to fend for ourselves for the better part of 4 months. It didn’t seem like the M&A team knew what to do with us and had forgotten we existed. - During the acquisition process, we were told that there would be tons of opportunities within the Salesforce organization but once we were in the Salesforce organization, in reality, there were no opportunities. We contacted departments and teams we were interested in and were repeatedly told that they were not hiring or that you needed XYZ experiences that none of us had. We had no choice in what department or role we were assigned. A role was thrown on us, whether we liked it or not, with no other presented opportunities. - My team and I were expected to hit ridiculous numbers as soon as we were acquired despite the fact that we were not fully integrated, did not receive the goal numbers until halfway through a quarter, and still had to facilitate the entire merging of all our systems with Salesforce's systems. We received very little support from the core Salesforce organization and were treated as if we were incompetent because we could not hit these numbers. It seemed like my team and I were being set up for failure so that the core team had a reason to get rid of us once we did not hit a specific goal."
8474,5.0,Extremely fast moving company. Colleagues moving at 150 MPH and it’s easy to fall behind. Also if you’ve never used Salesforce software before getting hired then there’s definitely a learning curve there.
8475,4.0,"Salesforce, while a great place to work in many aspects, isn’t truthful about its equal pay. Only those who are level 7 and above are eligible to receive equity grants. A large cohort of employees under level 7 are EAs, who are mostly female. Meaning that women are still not being treated equitably when it comes to overall pay. Sure, they can purchase stock through the ESPP, but that means they have to still pay out of pocket for something that other employees are given. Many leading companies in SV grant equity to all employees, regardless of level. For a company that touts equality and equal pay for all, why are women still unable to benefit from the success of the company, especially when they play a key role in the success?"
8476,5.0,"None that I've experienced. Salesforce offers customers the ability to swap products. There is a chance you'll get assigned to an account with a currently large burndown. Aside from this, which is a none issue, it is a great place to work."
8477,5.0,None that I can think of.
8478,5.0,"Not many, but may take longer to do things due to processes due to size of comp."
8479,5.0,- Onboarding can be a little overwhelming since there's a lot to learn when you first start (typical of most enterprise software companies)
8480,4.0,some product lines still evolving at the expense of lower sales and customer attrit
8481,5.0,Higher RSU compensation and tuition reimbursement raised to beyond 5250 are two things that could be better
8482,5.0,"Parking, parking, parking, parking, parking"
8483,5.0,"Can be overwhelming at first, but there are tools available to walk you through the process."
8484,5.0,Haven't found one yet really
8485,5.0,The company has grown so quickly that often the left hand doesn't seem to know what the right hand is doing which may create overlap in activities which reduces efficiency.
8486,4.0,No negatives for Sales Force.
8487,5.0,"Long hours, a lot of stress and although management keeps saying step away to re-charge, there is too much on to successfully step away"
8488,5.0,Nothing good place to show your skills
8489,4.0,there are few exceptions to above pros in middle management
8490,4.0,Sometimes I was not given enough responsability.
8491,4.0,"Long long long hours, team collaborations can be purely professional and lacks personal touch. Not many team events, lacking camaraderie."

8499,5.0,All of the above is work in totely
8500,2.0,"I’ve never worked in an environment where I’ve had to question my integrity and values as much as here. Transparency is requested by Salesforce, yet the opposite seems to be modelled and demanded by leaders."
8501,5.0,Need to hit certain criteria before promotion eligibility
8502,5.0,Nothing bad it's a nice place
8503,5.0,"tough targets, sometimes overwhelming workload"
8504,5.0,"competitive, may lead to clashes with leads, but this happens extremely rarely."
8505,5.0,Getting really big!!! Lots of M&A activity - getting hard to keep up as a SE with all the possible things to solution.
8506,5.0,"Very sales driven, and sometimes product innovation is slow"

8513,5.0,Becoming corporate Lack of progression in senior roles
8514,5.0,"There is ALOT of training that occurs through Trailhead, majority of which isn't specifically focused on the job at hand"
8515,5.0,Corporate structure Everybody has to go to Dublin
8516,5.0,Leadership makes interesting decisions that can lead to job redundancy.
8517,5.0,Some India-based leaders are biased and they try to micro-manage.
8518,4.0,need to organize that sometimes
8519,4.0,"- Internal politics sometimes, especially in getting promoted - High expectations and emphasis on hitting quota every month"
8520,5.0,dont have. i like it
8521,5.0,Nothing that I can think of
8522,4.0,less control over engagements can have a lot pressure at times massive difference in treatment between services and sales parts of the business can still need to mature Constant restructuring
8523,5.0,getting more cutthroat on T & E to take customers out. Moving to the all-digital world is conflicting to sales reps that are used to F2F relationship building and corporate travel. Big targets
8524,5.0,Bad tech in some of the teams working on the core product. Bad tooling and process in some teams
8525,1.0,The boss was angry or offensive and super informal The demand for performance was never backed up by proper training Not a lot of people stuck around due to some of the airheadedness of tbe boss of that area
8526,5.0,not too many people but fun
8527,1.0,"I used to work for Microsoft and Oracle. In comparison to them, SF is the worst... by far! The company (who claims their value is trust) employs managers who speak about their employees behind their back. The manager would cancel all the meetings I scheduled for us witout saying a word about it. Also, I heard him speaking about other people a coupld of times to find out later he did the same for me and my BDR in other meetings. That's all in terms of trust in practice. Also, for some regions, they push on selling and they have done zero market research. Therefore their product is not only worse than competitions, but also 10 times more expensive. Money as with other companies, but the amount of stress and mismanagement - not worth a month staying there!"
8528,5.0,Not seen any as of now
8529,4.0,"Some time work-life balance is not so good , especially in Support role"
8530,4.0,No Downsides are there present
8531,4.0,"If you agree to special projects your career may stagnate rather than grow. The newish job definitions created transparency, but don't always benefit the employee or the company when something outside of the box is needed. A PM working on a new product that will take a multi-year effort does not meet the requirements for their job or promotion because everything is based on an existing product and working with Scrum teams. Taking that big bet stretch assignment will bench you career-wise."
8532,5.0,Nothing major to write about.
8533,5.0,Sometimes a lot of politics
8534,4.0,Nothing bad to share it.
8535,2.0,"Huge company with lots of red tape. Keeps employees busy with internal requests, internal meetings and consumes selling time."
8536,3.0,Everything negative feels derivative of poor management practices. No career growth for individual contributors.
8537,3.0,"However, because of the unrealistic growth expectations, the pressure to over-perform and the fact that we can’t take more than a few days off in a row, makes it not the perfect culture anymore!"
8538,1.0,- Base salary for internal promotes is significantly lower so you’re effectively punished for staying with the company - Internal meetings & training keep increasing limiting time you can spend with customers - Drink the “kool aid” or risk being shunned - Growing targets with reduced territories - Local leadership are useless and have no authority to action anything. Always go via the US it’s laughable - Workplace bullying and micromanagement is common - Bureaucracy is out of control. Nothing can be done without a form going through a chain of command via 10 people which seems ironic given the who product value proposition is to promote simplicity and automation.
8539,5.0,Big ship so territories can be saturated. Can sometimes be hard to find resources internally for smaller accounts.
8540,5.0,A bit of pressure on targets.
8541,4.0,"Internal hire/promotions make less than external hires. Could be a big difference (Over 100k base - with accelerators/spiffs/bonuses it's worth over 300k difference in pay) Company is getting very big. The young start up, fast pace, and youthful vibe is gone. Lots of people from Oracle and white hair running the company. There are cliques. Usually between internal and external hires. Some management within Enterprise space power trip. Have massive egos. (Not all are like this as some are incredibly humble and well respected)"
8542,5.0,Corporate Politics are strong and evident
8543,4.0,It is becoming a big giant and therefore could be a stopper for individual growth in the future

8566,5.0,I can't find real cons It's really a great place

8640,3.0,"What they're doing is working at a business level. The company is a rocket ship, still. But it's at the expense of its people. Below are a few of the cons I find most frustrating. - Micro Management on an extreme scale. I joined just before the pandemic and it has gotten continually worse since being forced to work from home. You don't feel trusted. - Unrealistic workloads. - Encouraged to manage your work life balance but chastised if you actually do it. I've been scolded for having my car serviced at 2pm, or taking annual leave at a quarter cut off to celebrate a birthday. - Meetings for meetings sake burning precious time. - Saturated account sets. Prospects get bombarded continually from all angles of Salesforce and have been for over a decade. - Lead generation is down to you. You have to be BDR, AE and even SE on some opportunities, unless you're in the enterprise/strategic accounts. I have not had more than 3 leads passed to me in almost 18 months. - Always an ""urgent"" action that needs to be taken. Often which is not directly impacting your ability to engage with clients."
8641,3.0,"Difficult to achieve targets, processes keep changing each year, lack of job security due to cuts to the success management team in early 2020, difficulty in retaining talent (due to changes each year), role has become less and less consultative and more and more ad-hoc servicing a various range of requests from stakeholders within the business and customers externally, it seems that the changes are always out of everyone's control"

8661,4.0,Takes some time to adjust to this wonderful culture
8662,5.0,"Experience might differ between teams, depending on managers. As the company grows bigger, it's more difficult to maintain the same great culture among the people. Direction from HQ in the US is often irrelevant to the current situation in Asia"

8667,4.0,Costly Customizations and Add-Ons. ... Limited Technical Support. ... Time-Consuming Setup
8668,4.0,US blame culture when things get tough
8669,3.0,Local leadership is so focused on female diversity outcomes that talented internal and external candidates that don’t fit that profile are overlooked. Very “stepford wives” without any people of colour in senior roles within the CEO’s direct business (at least that was the case last year). Lots of people politic to get promoted - straight talkers and doers are often side lined vs “brand” individuals. Targets have become unrealistic and territories are carved so thin that by staying you are effectively giving yourself a pay cut each year. The culture has become bloated with self importance. Nothing humble about the way it’s presented. Over focus on certification and pointless training. Seems to keep an army busy while the workers barely get time to see customers anymore. Work/life balance depends on your role. Plenty of people seem to have lots of time to be volunteering or involved in non-revenue generating activities while other people are smashed.

8686,5.0,None that I can think of :)

8688,4.0,"Although the company has their offices globally, it provides fewer offshore opportunies to its employees if they relocate to different countries."
8689,5.0,"Disingenuous during the application process: Said that they were hiring for a specific country and then changed the country halfway through the interview process. Others had the same experience. Work from anywhere doesn't really mean ""work from anywhere"""
8690,5.0,"There is a lot of politics going on, which is ok if you don't want to be a manager. Sometimes seems a little unstructured without clear process"
8691,5.0,no cons or none at the moment.
8692,4.0,"Very forecast driven job, not able to deep dive on one topic"
8693,5.0,"If you are not ready to take in automation related challenges and have no zeal to learn automation, then you may get stuck. But this is almost with all great companies , ok the caliber of Salesforce. So this is a general evil , nothing related to specific Salesforce."

8695,5.0,"There really are not many cons, if you don’t like a competitive environment or fast paced you may not enjoy it"

8699,5.0,"Corporate work environment can sometime be boring, less individual interaction outside of work stuff. Needs to bring more personal events"
8700,5.0,Nothing to specify. As it’s one of the best IT company in India.
8701,5.0,"- Not to Salesforce fault, but all onboarding activities have been remote. Despite this, onboarding has been very thorough and organised."
8702,5.0,Typical pains of running a large company. Sometimes things can become bureaucratic and decision making can be slow and chaotic.

8710,5.0,No constructive feedback. Very impressed.
8711,4.0,Sometimes educating yourself on new things can be taxing
8712,5.0,The main con is the location in Dublin. Not an interesting city with not much to do
8713,2.0,"Mean girl clique - if you're not in the 'in group' and interested in always telling everyone how great you are and what wonderful thing you're taking credit for that someone else did...well, you're no-one. So many tiers of management, so many VPs and SVPs trying to justify whey they're there, it just gets exhausting. You can't quite see the termites, but the underlying rot has set in and been reinforced by all of the Oracle and Microsoft intake. The 'leaders' love talking about 'who they are as a leader (without seeming to understand you're only a leader if someone wants to follow you through choice, not reporting line). Talk of values is kind of funny - everyone loves to tell you what their values are, but ask them what that looks like when they're 'living their values' and they all pretty much draw a blank..."
8714,3.0,"Pay inequality across the company is regular. Promotions are based on whatever's easiest for the managers, not based on merit or who deserves it. They always talk about ""progression"", which is total waffle."
8715,5.0,None in my 2 year in Salesforce India. So far it has been an amazing experience
8716,5.0,I didn't find any cons. The company is taking care of employees and giving the best benefits compare to other companies.

8721,5.0,"None - clearly a great company to work for. Great mentality, team spirit, and travel opportunities. We are valued every day and feel that we make an impact to the business."
8722,5.0,"WFH is a disadvantage in such companies as you do not get to experience the amazing culture to that extent while sitting at home. Also, recognition for the employees can be improved."

8728,5.0,none to mind - onboarding was online and I truly loved it
8729,5.0,moving countries/transfers with the company are not easy
8730,3.0,"Equal Pay initiative - Even if you do extra efforts, at the end you will get appraisal equal to the team members who did nothing for the entire year.

8745,5.0,hardly any. You can easily work here for life
8746,1.0,"1) No transparency in performance management and probation confirmation 2) Manager behaves like fief and can do whatever he wants so you are screwed if you don't get a new manager 3) Most employees are hired from Oracle and are creating same toxic environment that exits there filled with insecurities, jealousy and mismanagement 4) HR is a handicapped mute spectator and works for the sake of keeping their jobs 5) Shifts hardship allowances were recently restructured to cut cost"
8747,5.0,Nothing that I could think of.
8748,5.0,-None that I know of so far
8749,5.0,It is a large organisation so as a Graduate it can be hard navigating
8750,1.0,"They promote equality but the reality is the environment is toxic. Filled with 'preference' and bias, if your boss like you then you can get the good set of accounts to work on, otherwise sorry you are on your own. To protect their image of best place to work, they 'create' lame reasons to make you leave on your own or terminate you, instead of being seen as firing / layoff people. Lots of politicking between management, the Ohana is a marketing gimmick, the reality is the management are mostly ex-oracle bringing along their old habits and culture and practicing them in here. Most of the great talent had left the company and the original good culture is dying. This will be the last place I recommend anyone to join."
8751,4.0,Little growth in the finance organisation as activities being moved elsewhere to COEs Lots of politics and departments working in silos
8752,5.0,"high expectations, monthly and quaterly driven, senior mentality,"
8753,5.0,Nothing to add at the moment.
8754,5.0,Still not well known in Europe compared to the US
8755,4.0,With large hierarchy structure Managers cannot support employees to their 100%
8756,4.0,Certain industries way outperform others [relevant to UK business unit]
8757,3.0,Bad Management could improve a little more up
8758,1.0,"Equality (Pun intended): IN spite of one of the core values of the company being Equality, the organization is RIFE with inequality. It first starts with who gets a seat at work. A company that boasts of technology and how they help businesses, they have no idea of what their growth is or will be. The tech teams grow inorganically leaving all the other teams to cram into rooms. There is clear discrimination right from senior leadership on who gets a seat and who does not. Tech teams are treated like kings and no one ( including the CTO)has the power to change their minds. There is a very heavy tone of ""ENTITLEMENT"" when any one approaches these tech teams or in discussions with them , something the company is very proud of. Even the facility team listens to what the leaders have to say and implement them. The Internal communication board even has a forum for people to vent, that is a great place for humor, with people complaining about the flavor of yogurt served in the fridge and many more trivial things.This (in)equality is not just limited to seating options but to pay, travel benefits and how they are treated by the infamous HRBP's ( or the human resources) They too clearly are unequal to teams, paying full attention to Tech teams and quite clearly ignoring smaller teams. I have met my ESBP twice till now ( official meetings) in my entire tenure as they are too busy taking care of the bigger teams. And who is there to ask them or question them, no one!! They seem to be the busiest team in the office while none of them are visible in the office post 4PM, imagine now when it is virtual. Talk about an easy job in Salesforce. Then there is a great term that they keep using ""OHANA"" like from an episode of Black Mirror they want to make sure you get sucked in to the idea of ,while the company really does not care. BTW that means' Family"" in Hawaiian, while no one is treated like one. Just giving people a lot of cupcakes and goodies( SWAG as they call it) is only marketing their company and the employees lap it up like puppies with a new chew toy. This is what the company's idea of a family is, give them stuff that is absolutely unnecessary and make them feel like they get ""SO MUCH"". Employees need to be bribed to fill up surveys, because well they don't do anything without a ""gift"". Any one who is planning to work for this organization should be particular about their ethics policies, which is an absolute joke.I am aware of some employees who were victims of this team, they either did not get justice for their complaint or were terminated for wrong decisions. I wish I had that kind of job where I can decide peoples' fates based on whims and fancies and no one to answer to. I strongly believe they have monthly targets to get people off the rolls! I know the HR team will scramble and get this review off this platform in an instant ( BTW one of the other values of the company is transparency). India offices are filled with wrong leaders and sadly nothing from the above will change."
8759,5.0,Nothing that I can think of now. Salesforce has built a great culture which indeed helps to achieve Team and Company Goals.
8760,4.0,"Out of necessity of scale and quickly assimilating acquired Companies, Salesforce applies a standardized performance measurement for it's sales teams across all lines of business. Unfortunately, this approach doesn't always accurately reflect acquired offerings success. In our case as an acquired Company, the bookings nuance negatively skewed performance reviews, merit increase, equity refresh etc. for our acquired staff post integration which reduced motivation & caused unnecessary attrition. General under investment in post sales/Customer success."
8761,2.0,has bad airconditioning and hierarchy
8762,2.0,Career progression is nearly impossible if you don't work in Sales or are not based in HQ in SF. It's really sad as many non-sales colleagues would love to stay with the comoany but they dont see a future as most non sales and non technical roles are based in the HQ.
8763,5.0,Not seeing at the moment
8764,1.0,Canadian Leadership is horrible. Pervasive culture of distrust. Toxic environment. No longer a rewarding place to work.

8775,4.0,Some tries to hand over their tasks
8776,5.0,Unfortunatelly there is no bad thing for work as I know
8777,1.0,"JP office is extremely domestic, and does not have the drive, momentum or speed which other international tech firms or a typical foreign sub company has as a working culture. Since the majority of the people in the back office has been working here for a very long time (which is a good thing in one way), many of them are not use to changes - rather prefer to stick to the norm. Ohana is one of the key culture (which is a great conceptually) in Salesforce. But in JP back office, this is recognized in a different/miss leading manner. More specifically, it's been recognized as ""protection"", rather than supporting and challenging each other for growth. This shows up as lack of ownership, professionalism and extremely conservative working style/attitude. If you try to challenge someone, you're taken in a different way. Since there's really no culture of challenging each other, it's taken very offensively --- that's still fine but the most shocking part is, senior management doesn't notice or understand anymore of the benefits of growth via challenges and constructive communication. This is one of the most disappointing aspects of this office where it doesn't show to the outer world --- I have seen another review saying ""a master of disguise"" and completely understand what it means. When joining, do not expect a high paced, competitive working style lead by professionals with strong ownership --- but rather expect a conservative environment, hence for those who are looking for growth via challenges, constructive communication and data driven decision makings, this may not be the best place for you. Money is good, but growth wise, not able to recommend."
8778,5.0,- There is never enough time in the week to learn everything and it can sometimes be overwhelming to try and get up to speed on the products (particularly when the company is buying new companies all the time and creating products for the market to deal with COVID workplace issues in addition).

I believe had I a different role, I would be submitting a very different review. However, from my experience, I simply cannot openly recommend the BDR role. It's seen as a necessary stepping stone role towards AE, is an awful role in itself, and I found myself dreading going into work every day & always came home stressed."

8906,2.0,"This was once a company I genuinely felt pride in working for. Now the narrative has slipped into a sense of window dressing for the media and the market which shines through in several ways: Time tracking and process adherence seems to have taken over every corner of the company. A few years ago you felt that you were encourage to be innovative and to spend time on deep level analysis. Now you have to justify every hour of your day and not necessarily to to the benefit of the customer. Turning more Oracle than Google. Work load pressure is immense and there is an increasing number of people on long term sick leave due to stress. Managers are very often in a different location to you and there is very little awareness of the difficulty this can pose around communication, a sense of overwhelm and time available. HR does not have a presence in the smaller countries. This affects the health of both staff and relations as employees do not know who to turn to for a ‘sanity check’ conversation if a situations arise. HR processes are clearly there to support management and protect the company. There is a lot of talk about the feedback culture but the reality is that constructive criticism only works with few of the managers. Overall the sense is that the many hires from Microsoft, Oracle and similar has begun to take over the company mindset. It is much more ‘Me First’ than what is to the benefit of us all - and the customers."
8907,4.0,"Support teams are tiny in comparison to the sales team size, absolutely mad. If you’re new you’re 90% certain to get a terrible patch. Middle management is weak - usually people that have survived long enough. Senior management is a revolving door like football managers. Quality of SE varies wildly. Sales training is poor to non existent. Go there with a well developed sales tool kit from a BMC style company. Salesforce employees can be cultish, and it’s infuriating. Have increasingly lowered the barriers for hiring."

8938,3.0,"Marketing marketing marketing. The company endlessly trumpets its supposed wonderfulness to the point where it feels like working in an endless commercial. There seems to be a huge push to constantly market the company both externally *and* internally; having the 'culture' shoved down our throats constantly. The company seems to spend an awful lot of money on fluffy extras (like pillows for all employees to put their mobile phones on at their desks, and professionally produced promotional videos for internal-only items) whilst asking employees not to use Roaming Data whilst abroad on business, and only allowing VPs to fly comfortably (some are more equal than others in this Ohana). PR touts Salesforce as a cutting edge company, but back-office systems are ancient and technology stacks are not integrated after years - there is a big disconnect between PR and reality, but the 'Ohana' papers over the cracks. Every All Hands address starts with 10 minutes of pom-pom waving cheerleading about how amazing we are. It gets tiresome."

8949,2.0,"I had a wonderful experience working with Salesforce for the first 3 years of my employment there. However, for the 18 months that followed, my life was made hell. I am so disappointed to say that this was a result of constant bullying from female employees. I had been cursed at and shouted at by a senior female leader repeatedly and in front of other employees, and when reported this to my director was told that there was nothing he could do as she was a VP. This went on for a year. There was extreme and constant bullying, negativity and back-stabbing from females in the US Marketing department, so much so that when a colleague went to interview for that department, the Head of Marketing told her they were having lots of problems on the team with bullying and back-stabbing etc, and was it something she would be able to deal with (the answer to which was obviously no). This type of bullying just became the norm, and was totally accepted. My own first line manager, who was also female, was incapable of giving any type of constructive or positive feedback, particularly to female members of the team, would openly speak negatively about senior leaders in a team meeting setting and was regularly described as being extremely de-motivating by all team members. Again when reported to more senior leadership nothing at all was done about this. I would regularly end my day in tears, spending more time trying to ward off this bullying than being able to focus on my actual work. All of this was documented to my director, and to Employee Services however nothing was done about it. My director would speak with me maybe once every 3-4 months, so I was subjected to bullying by my manager and made to cope with this by myself. My mental health, sleep, appetite and general well-being suffered dramatically and when I mentioned this to my director he told me that I should just go to Employee Services, he also asked if maybe I was having personal issues. Again, my first few years with Salesforce were great, I had amazing team members, male and (amazing) female leaders in Ireland and Canada. However working with management and marketing dept in the US was an entirely different experience and in the end proved to be unbearable. I was stuck in a horrible situation for far too long, with no support or outlet, totally isolated and unable to seek guidance from management. I do hope something is done about the widespread and consistent bullying that is carried out by female employees in the US offices, particularly with regard to the infamously volatile and toxic Marketing Department."

8977,3.0,"There’s a lack of trust in some leadership. Coaching is at a minimum. Having had roughly 9 managers in my tenure, I’ve had only two who have provided feedback to help me grow. That’s not a very good ratio. My current one’s response when asked after a customer meeting with an executive was “I’ll let you know if you’re doing something wrong”. That’s not in any way helpful. It’s impossible that I’ve done everything right in one of those meetings and I expect feedback to help me grow. I’m not asking for my hand to be held. I’m asking for guidance. Something you expect from your leader. The office can be quite clique-y and you have to fight your way in. Not quite the Ohana people hear about from the CEO."

8982,2.0,"-The Salesforce recipe is to grow and split territories and squeeze every rep as much as they can. This is how they report double-digit growth every year to their investors. -You are compensated the same irrespective of the products you sell, however, management only cares about the core products you sell (Sales/Service Cloud). To the outside world this may not make sense, however, you are looked down upon and will get performance managed if you are not selling enough of these core products. I'm not a lawyer but this doesn't sound legal under Canadian labour law. -“Teacher’s Pet” Culture - Majority of reps (80%) don’t hit their quota but you can still get promoted and have your career accelerated if you play the “game” and suck up to management. -Colleagues who have been here for a while say it used to be an exciting, fun company and now it’s far more corporate and there are a lot of unhappy people in the office."

To protect their image of best place to work, they 'create' lame reasons to make you leave on your own or terminate you, instead of being seen as firing / layoff people. Lots of politicking between management, the Ohana is a marketing gimmick, the reality is the management are mostly ex-oracle bringing along their old habits and culture and practicing them in here.

9014,1.0,"I was debating whether to post this because I know it won't make a difference. But in the end, I decide to post this because I feel the need to share what we went through. Last month, Salesforce laid off a good number of customer success group members, including myself. I don't know the exact % or number, but it is not a small percentage. People will likely think I am negative toward the company because I got layoff. And you are right, who wouldn't be. Over the years, I truly believe in Salesforce and put lots of heart and soul into the company. This sudden layout is not fun and now gave me lots of uncertainty about my career and how do I support my family going forward. Salesforce talked a lot about Trust and Ohana, but this move killed both ideas for me. Where is the Trust when Salesforce let us go when the company is doing well and continue to hire many other roles. Where is the Ohana when Salesforce management cares purely about the books than the well being of the employee. Salesforce will say they are assisting those of us impacted to find another role internally. But the reality is there is little help, we are on our own to find a new position. There are some great people internally trying to help, but they are doing it on their own and not because Salesforce management asked them to. Many other hiring managers wouldn't even give us the chance or response to us. I do not blame other Salesforce Ohana not sensitive to what happened to us, it didn't happen to them, so they do not feel our pain. The bottom line is Salesforce put the books over employees which is the opposite of everything Salesforce stand for and claim to be.."

Which has fostered a very ugly competitive and back-handed culture - with lack of trust a core problem throughout the UK, especially when dealing with US colleagues. - Lots of very talented people, from all aspects, Marketing, Product, and Sales have left the business, with their replacements (typically Graduates) lacking the basic skills."

In some teams like mine you can’t even work from home. -You have to travel abroad 3/4 times per month and they want you to take flights at dawn or at night cause “you can’t lose working hours”. -One of the best values is volunteering - guess what? Underestimated and not taken for real in my team. -Managers only care about numbers, you are not a person at all. -People underestimate people working in other companies cause they feel they are the best but they are so poor and sad inside. -If people leave cause they feel bad, the other “teammates” and managers will make fun of them. -Micromanagement: your manager will expect to be cc’d in every single email you send to your customers."

9059,2.0,"Managers are horrible coaches, when you don't do well they basically push you out instead out training or coaching"
9060,2.0,"Micromanagement: We have WEEKLY targets which fist of all requires Sales reps to justify themselves every week and exerts unnecessary pressure to close deals to unrealistic timelines which is damaging the client relationship. This also leads to non-stop pressure on a weekly basis which leaves no time to regenerate after a stressful month-end. While we are free to structure our days as we wish there are countless data points collected in the CRM which is used as a tool by management to exert additional pressure. Management style: We are not treated like professionals but more like interns who are here to learn and need to proof we are worthy of doing the job we are hired for. There is nothing more important than closing as many deals as possible as quickly as possible. Based on this all decisions are made disregarding the client relationship, the professional opinion of the sales rep or the health and the wellbeing of the rep. Unrealistic goals: Quotas are set unrealistically and only a handful of people are going to make their targets this year. On a bad month you go home with 2000 Euro which does not leave you much to live with an average room rent of 1200 Euro. Two of the teammates even live in camper vans."

9087,5.0,Can be a little overwhelming sometimes with all that is going on. If you don't thrive in a fast pace environment Marketing at Salesforce is probably not for you:-)
9088,5.0,"Big corporation: You need to pay a lot of attention to the metrics, you cant really change things, your territory can affect your result quite a lot (but to be fair they are trying to be fair about it), extremely difficult to hit OTE in the first years, not much support or marketing materials for non-US small business sales"

9185,4.0,"- Some of the co-prime sales teams are dominated by white people or those from USA, France or Australia. It does not make sense to do this in the Asia HQ. We need more Asian customer-facing employees who truly understand cultural nuances, local language and way of speaking. - Marketing could be much better when it comes to lead generation and content creation."
9186,1.0,"There is no culture at all. Ohana, VTO, Customer Success... They are just words. In my team, we were obliged to work on bank holidays and not allowed to take the day back off when it was BH in the country we covered. There is no flexibility in WFH. But what's really the worst is the management. In Salesforce there are no leaders, just poor managers. It all works around internal politics and friendships with people crossing borders continuously. Also, those ""managers"" text you after working hours and have no respect of your personal life. There is no interest in who you are as a person or your background, just how much you're closing. It's the least human company in tech I have ever witnessed and keeps losing talent year over year. I had a burnout and had my manager talk poorly and joking about me with team members and peers. Just one last thing, AEs are pushed to always complain about business partners (Solution Engineers, Sales Dev and Customer Success) when they really are the only ones to make the job qualitative and worth it."
9187,4.0,"Goodbye creativity and energy. Hello process, admin, time tracking & checkbox exercises. Remuneration. The share scheme is poor. Don't expect OTE and forget about incentive accelerators.

9197,5.0,Nothing major that I can think of
9198,4.0,"Management by metrics: The sales org lives on weekly metrics and targets. Its very clinical and dispassionate. Despite the Ohana, it can feel like you're there to make a number, and nothing more."

9200,5.0,I have nothing to share
9201,4.0,Too many training are required

9223,5.0,Line manager was not very helpful.
9224,4.0,"Not much internal opportunities, lots of friendly relationships in teams that lead to promotions"

9236,4.0,Getting too complex and matrix
9237,4.0,None right now - has been great so far.

9239,5.0,Promotion path is not very clear

9247,5.0,"You have to find your way in the company, it is sometimes not clearly organised. Think of a start-up with 50.000 people :) Salesforce has a perfect on boarding programme and people are willing to help you, but you need to reach out to get that help. So you have to take initiative."
9248,5.0,Need to sometimes deal with legacy code
9249,5.0,It grew from 15K people to 55K in 5 years and is now a gigantic structure. Do not look for startup culture.
9250,1.0,No yearly performance reviews. No yearly salary increase. Change management every year. Toxic environment. Self-centred people. Back-stabbing culture. People higher up take credit for work others have done. Everyone is there for the money and pretend to make the world a better place. If management doesn't like you they'll make sure you won't progress in your career.
9251,4.0,Some team's tech stacks are stuck in the 2000s. Sometimes people do things with inertia and use new tech with old thinking. It can be really frustrating at times.

9258,4.0,i dont have a cons for this job.
9259,4.0,"- Work-life balance is missing, especially now during covid, you will work long days and sometimes also in weekends. Work never ends. - Very performance driven, always high pressure to sell more, a lot of forecasting and at times micro-management. - Management is lacking coaching/people/leadership skills, you are heavily managed on opportunities and numbers, but very little on personal improvement. - Politics are present, as well as ego-centrism within sales & mngmnt. - Achieving your target depends on the distribution of accounts and opportunities, which changes every year. - Very complex internal organisation that can come across as impersonal at times. eg no HR and if you have questions you can only log tickets."

9305,3.0,"- The product itself isn't that interesting - Each team is responsible for their own interview process so some people aren't as professional as others - It feels like team leaders aren't getting enough feedback on actions their making, sometimes a team leader can make a bad move, and it feels like he\she doesn't really care about their employees feedback, I would expect their manager to give them true feedback or simply notice that someone is doing something stupid and should stop them. - Diversity"

9332,1.0,"List is pretty huge but will try to be as precise as possible. Management need leadership skills. Had multiple discussion with HR on differences with management with no proper response from HR either. To my surprise I was asked to voluntarily resign and leave the organization without prior notice for raising challenges with Management and HR. After all these year when I try to reapply for a similar profile that showed up, I get a response stating my application is not a match which is not true coz I did same stuff earlier in Salesforce. It is okay to reject my profile but to my surprise someone in Salesforce system has changed my Country to Netherlands in Salesforce Database which will cause rejection of all my future applications for opportunities . Company which boasts of Ohana culture, transparency needs to take another look at themselves."

9405,5.0,Not much to say in the downside
9406,1.0,"I don't think this review will change anything inside the company, but I hope it will enable people considering to join take a more informed decision. 1] Consider this: They fired several people on the back of the strongest quarter in company's history, that too in the middle of pandemic! Mark promised no layoffs for 3 months, and looked like he was waiting for 3 months to be over. LOL. 2] Unhealthy competition between global teams. US teams typically are more prone to hiding information from other teams across the globe. If you don't know the requirement, you can't build the system, and if you can't build the system, you are labelled as incompetent. (Sr.) Directors/ (Sr.) Managers will NEVER take accountability to gather the necessary information, and delegate all work to ICs (even freshers in some case). Since ICs are ill-equipped to make senior managers or directors in the US to divulge information, they practically get blocked, which results in underperformance discussions for ICs. This brings me to the next important claim by Salesforce - ""Embrace Feedback and Promote Transparency""! 3] I personally know people who would speak up to management (""see something, say something""). Somehow, those were the people who typically got impacted by ""restructuring"". Secondly, all this talk about transparency, and they won't divulge your performance ratings to you. This is the only place this happens. So my question is, if the employee doesn't know how the manager sees their performance, how would they take an informed decision on what next to expect or even challenge that assessment. The performance conversations are always positive from managers, so managers don't need to worry about the internal survey ratings from their team! OH MY, WHAT A MESS. Who's to stop managers from saying you performed awesome, but put a rating of 2 in the backend system? There are more, but I think you would have got an idea by now that the work environment is, at best, extremely toxic inside the sugar coated candy that gets presented to the outside world."

9415,4.0,Dublin is loosing its dominance as the business goes more in country based

9425,4.0,Shifts Nothing much Carrer growth Unrealistic targets No regular working hours
9426,3.0,There are a number of incompetent leaders who diminish the abilities and talent of the people reporting to them. Company is very sales and revenue focused which often drives the wrong behavior in the sales teams - making them less concerned about doing what's right for the customer in favor of making their quotas. Customer Success team is hugely understaffed.

9431,3.0,"Changing culture with lots of Oracle People coming in in Management Customer focus is number 2 bypassed by ACV Confusing product rebrandings and while marketing is mobile, social ..... a shitty mobile product. Performance Edition must be an Idea from a person who never been at a customer. Unified platform is a Powerpoint Concept. Carreers depends on Buddy business and even people from Middle Management pushes the new market approach while knowing that these concepts failed at Oracle before. Critics are not allowed, we have to believe....and cheer... #awesome"
9432,5.0,"Organization split into silos thus prohibiting all division to collaborate around 1 client through it's life cycle. Some colleagues focused on 'plucking the low hanging fruit' and not at getting share of wallet within one enterprise customer.

9438,2.0,"Pay below comparable jobs at other companies High school football captain culture Lack of talent at higher management level (great politicians, often not competent) Work life balance CEO personality cult"
9439,3.0,Too much speedy. Revenue driven culture so number is everything. when you assign bad territory it's so miserable to survive.
9440,3.0,"In short: - Total compensation package less attractive than @ first sight - Sales Territory subject to change any time, any way. - Heavily Political - Poor Management - Little diversity (in terms of skills, background and genre) Management is surprisingly immature for a 10.000 people company, nobody really cares about you, numbers is all that matters. As such the aim of management is only hitting the number, no matter what. Meaning: no resource development, little training, harsh treatment when something goes wrong, no coaching, no understanding whatsoever. Numbers arrive, you're a star. They don't, you're an a***ole. The internal mantra is SFDC wants to innovate, unlike Oracle these days. Yet 50% of the people come from Oracle and they keep coming. Be very careful about what you are told at the interview. The territory assigned wil almost surely change after a few months, for the good (unlikely) or the bad (very much likely). Base pay is high (variable is becoming more and more difficult to hit and beat) but benefits are quite limited with respect to other IT companies. If evaluated in overall package the comparison is less favourable than originally thought bringing it to on par with other major IT employer. Also, the environment is pretty political: hiring is based on who you know, internally and externally, not on what you do and what you can achieve and not always the two aspects lead to the same point. As such relations are valued more than skills. Kind of : so is life but if you expect something different...."
9441,5.0,Teams shares the same challenge in a start-up for access to budgeting. Sometimes changes are made to often and creates additional workload
9442,1.0,9All the policies are not implemented strictly example Dream force and New Hire orientation(boot camp) especially in India (because of budget). Lot of Local Management in India and lot of internal politics
9443,3.0,The culture changed dramatically during the growth to the actual size of more than 10000 people. At the beginning it was all very hands on and pragmatic. Since the so called CFL organization has been established a lot of politics came up. You need to be a good soldier to execute orders. If you still think you can contribute by using your brain and experiences: Good luck in find the niche to do so. In all other departments you really need the ability to switch off your brain. => Management is made up of selfish and egocentric soldiers. Only very few exceptions.

9475,4.0,Oracle 2.0 Over inflated characters who spend most of their time preening their egos Vicious political infighting Revolving door management
9476,3.0,Lots of great people but a question mark about who and where recent senior people have come from over the last 18 months and hence what impact their career history is having on the company's culture. It's changed. Very corporate and hierarchical. No longer a start up feel so don't expect that unless you're coming from a monster sized company like Oracle or somewhere similar.

Respected staff are overlooked for promotion in favour of more recent political plants about 10% of the sales team earn near their ote, the rest make do on their basic. All of the above are resulting in poor morale and unrealistic expectations being set for new employees. If considering a role in sales ensure you can survive on basic as you won't hit toe unless you are very lucky."

I met some of my best friends there. Working along side smart, motivated people kept me sharp, but there were also people dumb as rocks. Because it's such a large sales group some bright ones never got to shine and some rocks never got exposed and are still there after many many years."
9610,4.0,Remote employees have little growth opportunity.
9611,4.0,"There is no potential for growth. I'm in the Support department and the only way to move is to become a manager or add a title but do the same duties. In this department they think of you as a ""resource"" and not as a special individual contributor. There is too much of a focus on quantity rather than quality. Process changes occur every 6 months and there is no thought into it. Career development is just a paper you have to fill out that never gets mentioned again."

9617,5.0,"The company is full of so many talented people that it can be quite intimidating to keep pace with the best and brightest in the field. It is a high performance culture and many cannot handle the expectations. In the end, we always do what is right to make our customers successful...that can mean working 12-15 hours a day...but it is worth it to make and sell a product that customers love and to be changing the software industry for the better."

9630,4.0,"Highly competative environment that lends itself to favoritism & backhanded ways of moving up the latter (@ss kissing, throwing colleagues under the bus) Difficult place to get ahead in unless you kill yourself Work life balance can be difficult when trying to advance in career There is so much going on, at times it's almost too much. It's hard to keep up with all the changes and management doesn't do a great time of giving you time to be trained when changes arise Has lost the startup vibe- which means the employees suffer. SFDC is now more concerned with making money than protecting their employees"
9631,4.0,Lack of communication from top management . Sometimes even acquisitions are not communicated in the right way . Not many options for career advancement .
9632,3.0,"- senior mgmt doesn't have a clue, so we get powerpoint to death and corporate mumbo jumbo that gets annoying quick - no innovation anymore, refer to 1st point for reasoning - become highly political and promo's are slow, resulting in backstabbing, etc. - most annoying thing is execution as it's horrible and sfdc is just talk and no substance, some examples include: i) appexchange and the platform has been talked about for years and yet they're still literally at ground zero, partly due to horrible relationship/setup with partner community. ii) they talk about asia being fastest growing market for them, yet thats just false hype as marc himself says he don't care about china market at all since there's no results. it seems they don't want to invest unless they see results, sort of like chicken/egg problem."

9634,5.0,"Because of the growht of the company the hiring was too fast and now there are some people that has not the level to keep with the company expectations . Sometimes decisions can be political and based in ""what have to do"" and not in ""what shoul do"". Very poor HR level."
9635,4.0,"Politics, uneven salaries, top heavy."
9636,2.0,"Unbelievably intense politics. Senior management gets their information from their inner circle, yet the inner circle is completely out of touch with what's really going on in the field and with employees. They make a great show of asking for input (such as Idea exchange and employee surveys) and then don't act on it. Very difficult interview process and then no support once you get in the door."
9637,3.0,- highly political - no one reviewing sr. management actions or behavior / mgmt training needed - lack of clarity on career path options
9638,4.0,"- Not really a meritocracy, although likes to be seen as one - Too many right place right time promotions to those without the ability, leading to failure - Political in many parts of the organisation - Long hours to get anywhere - Salaries reviewed infrequently"

9640,5.0,Territories can be quite uneven and there is a monthly grind that doesn't always align with how our customers buy. Very stressful management culture.
9641,4.0,"Work life balance in services non-existent. Company grew too fast to keep up with the great team dynamic that made it such a creative, exciting, progressive place to work. US did not understand non-US jurisdictions and had not desire to do so. US tried to make it an overly structured, regimented corporate when it's greatest asset was it's agile, non-conformist style that enabled creativity, intrapreneurship and great teamwork"

9647,5.0,"I could work 24 hours a day and I would still have stuff on my list to do! If you are a 9-5 kind of person - you won't like it at salesforce.com - you wouldn't keep up with the speed everything moves at and you would be left behind. The flip side is that when I go to the gym at 10am because I have a space in the diary - its absolutely ok. I enjoy the hard working, high achieving culture even if it means being switched on 23/6."
9648,5.0,"We work hard, but we play hard too :)"
9649,5.0,"No company is perfect. Salesforce.com isn't for everyone. The pace is relentless. It's a rocket-ride. But the flipside of that is that everyone is driving in the same direction and everyone knows the mission. For people who already think they know how things should be done, who understand how real companies operate, who learned their lessons in a prior decade and think they can come and bring these ideas to help salesforce.com ""grow-up"" - they usually feel like they are banging their heads into a wall. Everyone who joins starts by starting over - learning some of the fundamentals that make the company different, and IMHO better than the traditional software or technology companies."

9655,4.0,It is easy to burnout.
9656,5.0,Know that there is a high pace to the work at Salesforce. We work in an area of the industry with tremendous growth and continued growth potential. Some people may not fit well in such an environment.
9657,4.0,The pace isn't for everyone. The shiny lights turn to spotlights once you're carrying quota. There is a revolving door for those that can't hit their numbers or cannot adapt to the environment. Put your best foot forward!
9658,5.0,Intense at times. If you don't know how to manage your time then you could get stressed out. If you're not good working as a team then you won't survive.

9663,5.0,Salaries are not quite as competitive as other firms out there but the ESPP makes up for that given the stock has been doing well.
9664,4.0,- growth is not defined well - mgt team is so swamped that they dont take time for team/team events
9665,2.0,"While the west coast may be working on meeting Marc's lofty goals, the midwest(specifically midwest CSG) is swiftly becoming the white male centric world. Women are not staying within various roles within CSG in growing numbers and it's becoming very obvious that this is a white man's world. If you read the Chicago Tribune this weekend, you will not that more and more diversity factors(black, Hispanic, etc) are leaving for more favorable areas from every company, not just SF. If anyone would do the data analysis for CSG Chicago, warning bells should go off. The executive leadership is slowly but surely driving women out of their workforce vs embracing Marc's culture."
9666,5.0,"Can be a long commute from East Bay as it is in San Francisco. Sometimes Bart gets delayed, which lead to long commute hours."
9667,4.0,"Company is getting big and losing its intimacy of a small and nimble startup. Now at the 4th largest software company, it has the challenges of a large company"

9669,4.0,"There are too many AEs and not enough territory. I increased revenue in my territory by 400%, and didn't hit quota. Only 20% of AE's in my vertical hit their quota, and all of them had been there for 5+ years."
9670,5.0,"***FOR SALESFORCE.ORG*** -we work hard but I'd say we maintain a solid work/life balance -HQ is located in San Francisco, so unless you have rent control it's quite an expensive city to live in! -High expectations of performance from Sr Management (however I find this as an interesting challenge and motivating)"
9671,5.0,"Some conflict between ""Old"" salesforce culture (people who have been here a long time) and ""newer"" people from established enterprise software companies such as Oracle"
9672,3.0,Beware of your territory assignment if you are in sales. High turnover and growth dictate that territories may not be sustainable.

9690,5.0,Growing too fast. Might jeopardize the culture of the company and might move in the direction of very coorparety
9691,3.0,"- Compensation is low relative to peer companies - Days can be long (11-12 hrs minimum) and, after ~1 year, provide diminishing marginal return from the same role (result of 11-12+ hours of the same thing every day) - Team is hierarchical, having lost any ""startup"" feel it had as a result of significant growth. Result is a more political environments - Career trajectory within company is undefined and getting narrower as team's growth slows and more management levels are introduced. Promotion periods have also been extended, with fewer opportunities for ""moving up"" as a result - Rapidly diminishing exposure to senior management - more of a ""performance reporting and presentation creation"" role for the managers on the team"
9692,5.0,The company is growing quickly. We're still learning how to balance scale with best practices. I rather like that we have autonomy to figure things out on our own as leaders.
9693,5.0,"Conservative in many ways, need to avoid breaking customers. Monolithic codebase, need more focus on productivity. Hard to work across teams sometimes. Hard to get things done often."
9694,5.0,Still got a lot of growing to do so is somewhat tactical compared to other enterprise software companies. If you join - come planning on helping to create solutions not follow someone else's plan
9695,5.0,-Large accounting org and sometimes you're not fully aware of what other teams are doing -no free lunch
9696,5.0,"I can be difficult to become a true member of the team if you are remote, and not in a hub."
9697,5.0,"everything is changing, may not be a bad thing, depend on your preference"
9698,5.0,"Honestly the only downside I've been able to come up with is that they don't allow dogs. The relationship back to SFDC core isn't perfect (more stringent security and trust requirements), but as a multi-billion dollar company with multi-million dollar contracts that rely on the integrity of secure customer data I can understand that."
9699,4.0,too much going on at the same time
9700,5.0,"- your career path may be limited if you do not live in one of our hubs - although this may not be a negative for everyone, the company moves and extremely fast pace, and if you do not keep up with it you made quickly find yourself disconnected from the momentum of the company"
9701,5.0,"The code base has some tech debt, and the infrastructure could improve on its ability to deliver capacity. The product is great, but the time it takes to get stuff done is longer than optimal."
9702,5.0,Growing so fast some of the culture might be lost.
9703,4.0,"It is a very large company so it is possible to sometimes get ""lost"" in navigating the company structure."
9704,5.0,"Things change fast! The company is growing very quickly hiring nearly 6000 people this past year. Not really a bad thing, but definitely something to be prepared to adapt quickly to personnel and technology changes."
9705,5.0,Better stock compensation. Clear career path recommended.
9706,3.0,Bate and switch with territories
9707,5.0,there where no cons working for the company.
9708,5.0,Some messaging fails to get down to all levels. Some lower level managers focus on things that do not seem aligned to who we are and how we do it and seem to focus too much on cost savings. Internal promotions seem to be passed up as an opportunity to grow existing talent over hiring outsiders that come in and have to learn the culture (which takes a little time)
9709,3.0,"Infrastructure engineering is very top heavy. It's become an org of overpriced ex Microsoft executives that have not delivered anything of value to the company and the group. There is complete lack of innovation in management style or technology. They have brought with them the management style of the 90's, which didn't really work to well for MSFT. The feeling in the group is contempt for Salesforce and the people committed to Salesforce. People work in fear, which is not the culture it was before they joined. It's sad to see the disregard that they have towards building an org on the values of Salesforce. Bad behavior and horrible treatment of individuals has been overlooked time and time again by HR and management."
9710,5.0,"Changes with acquisitions, remote employees sometimes feel left behind - but do get caught up. Company culture differs between cities."
9711,5.0,"No cons to list. Everything is great, grade A++"
9712,4.0,It has become a very large and successful company so if you are looking for a startup or small company experience this will not be a fit.
9713,4.0,"Difficult to navigate as a newcomer. Took me 3 weeks to get set up with a phone and laptop. For a tech giant that preaches innovation, they still have areas to catch up with."
9714,4.0,Sometimes when you work in a such a big company it's hard to get noticed for the value you provide and when it's as big as Salesforce it's hard to get assigned to work on truly strategic projects.
9715,5.0,No real cons. There is so much opportunity in the market that it's difficult to get to it all. Quality people that have to ramp quickly when they come on board.
9716,5.0,"Remote employee engagement could get better, but the independence it provides is unparalleled."
9717,5.0,Very fast paced and exciting so not for all
9718,5.0,I didn't go to work for Salesforce sooner.
9719,5.0,"Growing pains as a result of fast growth but given the rate of growth, the organization recognizes this"
9720,5.0,Growing very fast that sometimes it's hard to navigate around the different groups and departments.
9721,5.0,It can be hard to have a work/life balance.
9722,5.0,With the growth - customer relationships can suffer when we re-align territories and new people are working with an account.
9723,5.0,Teams within accounting are very compartmentalized and offer little visibility into what the others are doing.
9724,5.0,"There are really low cons, can't think of any at this time. Perhaps this is based on the different teams or locations."
9725,4.0,"Management does not know how to manage, lots of technical strong person but unorganized skills. Lack of interesting projects."
9726,5.0,"So much work to do! So much infrastructure to fix - to automate. The leaders know that things need to be fixed and have provided a vision, but they need to do a better job of communicating it and ensure we are all marching to the same drum beat. From a Technical program perspective, they need to hire more! They are in middle of a transition, and from an Infrastructure Engineering perspective they are currently at a ratio of about 25-30 engineers per TPM. It needs to be more like 10 engineers per TPM."
9727,5.0,No Cheetos in the kitchen.
9728,4.0,- Too much emphasis on utilization a
9729,3.0,We're getting too big and are less and less connected with our employees. We struggle at times with deciding between doing what's right for the business and doing what's right for our people. It's inevitable with a mature business like salesforce.
9730,5.0,"You better be organized, driven and accountable. People fail fast here."
9731,3.0,Hiring and promotion decisions are at times perplexing. Senior leadership seems disconnected from the masses. The organization is getting big - HR needs to be more involved and influence more.
9732,4.0,- Takes enormous effort to coordinate across teams - Remote culture can also serve as a double-edged sword when it comes to team bonding
9733,4.0,"slow to change, slow releases, becoming more political"
9734,5.0,It takes two years before you are in a closing role. Although development is everything in Salesforce and this training will pay off.
9735,4.0,"Growth and change can be challenging to manage. Sometimes when new products are rolled out, they're not fully baked. As in many places, there can be a cliquey/fratty feel to some of the sales teams but nothing that can't be managed. I had to be diligent about tracking my sales to ensure I got paid appropriately; it was a pain in the butt but I learned this the hard way."
9736,4.0,a lot of re-org recently
9737,5.0,-Headcount growing perhaps too quickly which could transform the community feel to a more corporate environment -Does not offer full meals (light snacks and beverages are provided) -Signals of a more corporate future ahead evidenced by a shift away from local vendors to their global competitors
9738,4.0,"Very large company that wants to work in fast-paced start-up mode, but because of sheer size, everything takes longer than you'd hope and approvals can be a nightmare."
9739,4.0,"Teams are very siloed. Head's down work environment. A lot of people do not participate in work events because they're too busy. If you're in services department, you won't have the best work/life balance"
9740,4.0,"Prepare to work HARD - and often feel overworked. It's a lot to handle, at times, and very fast-paced. It's also easy to feel like just a number here given that there are thousands of employees in SF."
9741,5.0,Cannot think of any cons
9742,5.0,Start-up company growing into adolescence is fostering a slightly more siloed environment
9743,5.0,- Salary is not the most competitive when compared against other companies of this size - Can sometimes run into corporate red tape when trying to get things approved
9744,5.0,I'd be hard pressed to come up with any major cons. I do wish that I had more of an opportunity to advance within the company before h
9745,5.0,"It is a very competitive environment. The company has done a really good job cultivating a culture of ownership, accountability, trust, and potential for growth. Not a con, but the vast majority of employees are type A personalities that want to win and advance through the ranks. People are very collaborative and supportive because that behavior is rewarded at Salesforce, and these types of personalities making up Salesforce is largely why the company has been so successful. That said, as is the case of any ultra high performing environment, everyone wants to be at the top."
9746,4.0,SF centric New Managers coming in who have no idea of how to leverage skill sets Too many re-orgs especially in CSG
9747,5.0,Not as much 1:1 development as I had expected
9748,4.0,- Mixed messages from the sales management team when it comes to focusing on customer's success and prioritizing aggressive growth creates a pressure-sale environment which can/does damage our relationship and credibility
9749,3.0,If you are considering the enterprise business unit or any sales don't accept the job until you know your accounts/assignment. In enterprise sales they are cutting your accounts in half each year and your quota goes up
9750,3.0,Headquarters centric. Unless you're in San Francisco you don't get the same culture and its an uphill battle to get in with the top projects.
9751,5.0,Nothing really to add here.
9752,4.0,- Too much to learn - Not a lot of guidance in certain areas - Micro-managed in certain roles
9753,4.0,"Large company bureaucracy (red tape), difficult to work your way up in the company (in large part due to large size & red tape). Work can be monotonous at times (somewhat turns you into a one-trick pony), but, all-in-all, is typically fulfilling on a day-to-day basis."
9754,4.0,Opportunities for advancement working outside of HQ are limited
9755,5.0,"pressured workplace, tendency towards long hours"
9756,5.0,"Lots of red tape, decisions take a while to make sometimes."
9757,5.0,you need to be comfortable with 100% accountability and a super fast pace
9758,4.0,"Sometimes, it can be a little to fast paced.. We never stop. If you like change, its a great place because there is always change here!"
9759,5.0,I don't have any Cons to report!
9760,5.0,Pays less than other sales dev orgs.
9761,5.0,Big company politics Career growth may take some time.
9762,2.0,"Office driven culture, very transactional, you will not make money if you are put in a bad territory. Office politics are some of the worst I have ever experienced. Zero diversity, no women managers."
9763,5.0,Not much worth a mention
9764,5.0,Company is growing fast and so scope of work is reducing exponentially.
9765,5.0,"It is definitely overwhelming but, that's the only con."
9766,5.0,Pay is less than what industry standards would be.
9767,5.0,Change happens a lot and can be frustrating
9768,5.0,Many benefits are only available where Salesforce has an official office
9769,2.0,"1. Too much politics! You will spend more time dodging criticisms and blames, rather than doing actual work. 2. Unless you can speak ""Tamil"" or ""Telugu"", or are awesome at work politics, you shouldn't join this company's IT department. Hard work is not rewarded. 3. Absolutely not worth being here if you are a contractor, unless you don't mind being treated like a slave."
9770,5.0,no specific cons to speak of
9771,5.0,roles are sliced too thin. business still tilted towards the core sfa and service cloud business.
9772,4.0,"Growing, company needs starting to overshadow employee needs. Also, the territories for Account Executives are extremely small and competitive, most Account Executives don't make quota. Hit or miss. Not very good training."
9773,5.0,None so far. One of the best companies to work for.
9774,5.0,"Targets are always changing, you can feel left behind."
9775,1.0,- Pay is no longer competitive with peers - Long Hours with little recognition - Limited ability to move up in the company
9776,4.0,Career path in my role is loosely-defined. Gets to be a bit too much of a 'salesy' locker-room type culture on occasion.
9777,3.0,"This is a tough one, because I love this company in so many ways. I'm not a bitter ex-employee; on the contrary, I'm extremely happy here and I want to have a long career with Salesforce. That's what breaks my heart about how little commitment to diversity the company has. To illustrate the point, I am black, and I cannot reveal my gender and office location, because doing so would reveal my identity. That's how few black employees we have at the company. Now, it's easy to fall back on the usual tech industry explanation of there being a ""pipeline issue"" that ties to minority education in STEM. There's absolutely truth to that, as you can't recruit what's not there. But here's the thing: when you fill your ranks with the same type of people in order to maintain some sort of ""company culture"", you create an environment in which the employees don't have enough exposure to people not like them to think of them as co-workers. The proof? If even your fictional website, PowerPoint and product demo characters are all white, there's a deeper problem than a simple ""pipeline issue"". It means non-white people are not part of your worldview. The implications of that are dire."
9778,4.0,none that I can think of at this moment.
9779,5.0,It's a very large company.
9780,5.0,If you dont do your job well you wont last long
9781,5.0,- So much to learn! It can be overwhelming. - Would love to spend more time at the home office.
9782,3.0,"IT Management has devolved into a completely political organization. Success is defined by who you know, not by the work you do or your results. Promotion to management is unplanned and turnover is high."
9783,5.0,- Onboarding programs are in development
9784,5.0,"None at this time, but work-life balance is something to consider, as this is a high-pressure job with high expectations. As long as that is considered beforehand, there should not be any surprises."
9785,5.0,Strategic accounts buying cycles can are feast or famine.
9786,5.0,tech stack limited to salesforce
9787,4.0,Great company but becoming too big for it's own good. Some of middle management is not very well qualified but are there by chance - timing. Can have a very Bro culture.
9788,4.0,"Big Company - lot of hoops to jump through, career path is hard to navigate"
9789,4.0,"Too many meetings, especially daily standup meetings"
9790,5.0,Product management group is dysfunctional Limited accountability to managers and engineers Some people/groups spend more time arguing why something is too hard rather than just doing it
9791,4.0,growth becomes stagnant after couple years
9792,5.0,Always expected to work harder
9793,5.0,It's incredibly hard to get hired here & the interview process can be lengthy. The dynamic nature of the company may be hard for those who don't do well with change.
9794,5.0,Territory Alignment and constant changing annually
9795,5.0,Work could be overwhelming at times
9796,5.0,Fast pace of revenue growth can be a source of stress at times.
9797,5.0,Some growing pains as the size of the company is increasing.
9798,5.0,"working remote, I miss out on some of the fun"
9799,5.0,Meetings can be a bit tedious
9800,5.0,"Fast pace, too much going on"
9801,3.0,"Senior management was very political and lots of title inflation. SVPs, VPs everywhere--couldn't tell who was really important and who was. Heavy emphasis on marketing and bright lights--and less on developing people talent."
9802,5.0,I honestly havent come across any yet.
9803,5.0,people that makes no sense but have the authority.
9804,5.0,"Structure, career development (lack of)"
9805,5.0,Have to be able to change quickly
9806,5.0,Not enough vegetarian options ;)
9807,4.0,"Many different scrum teams brings up its own challenges, sometimes other teams will add work to your backlog and you will be required to sign off without much notice, siloed information across different units"
9808,5.0,I can't think of any
9809,5.0,None whatsoever. I love the place.
9810,5.0,"Internal politics, maintaining internal equity, red tape"
9811,5.0,there was nothing significant to note
9812,5.0,"getting a little big, but that's the price of success."
9813,5.0,"none really, pay is a little less than what other companies pay for support"
9814,5.0,Change is constant but thats only negative if you let it be
9815,5.0,Things change really fast here. One moment you are working on something and the next you will be working on something else. Some accumulated technical debt as the company is growing way too fast. Benefits are slightly below average compared to the other big names.
9816,5.0,Sometime the speed of the bureaucracy can be frustrating.
9817,2.0,"You could very likely be overworked and under resourced - employees stretched way too thin. You could have a poor untrained middle manager w/ a VP title and little experience in their area or managing people well. You will likely encounter a growing list of unhappy customers particularly in the small business sector as the products are too expensive and too hard to use. Managers/exes running scared looking for scapegoats, and you could be one of them."
9818,5.0,There were no cons with this employer.
9819,4.0,A culture of self-promotion and individual success. Not a very team-oriented culture. Fosters focus on building an illusion of personal success internally.
9820,5.0,"-Although I love the company culture of giving back and always pushing harder and faster, it can ware you down if your not careful. Pacing yourself is very important. -Upper management (VP and above) mean well but manages to make the team nervous and work off of fear of being made to look bad in front of the entire department. -Recruiters often have a tough time working with our support (Keeping in mind that sourcing support is something a lot of recruiters don't have experience with before coming to Salesforce)"
9821,4.0,Slow at times Has challenges that any other company this size may face
9822,1.0,"Very few accounts to work on, recruiter basically lied to me told me I could make tons of $$$. I left a high paying job for the promise of a higher paying one. Found out it's all a lie and only the ones that have been there forever are making any money. People are jumping like rats on a ship and their turnover is more than 50%. Management has no clue. Neither does Marc Benioff."
9823,4.0,Lots of chaos and growing pains
9824,5.0,- Organizational change is difficult. Everything changes every month on the Marketing Cloud Support team. This will calm down as the Marketing Cloud assimilates further into Salesforce practices.
9825,5.0,So far I have not found any
9826,5.0,none that I can think of. Lots of politics for some reason.
9827,4.0,Sales is very high pressure and monthly cadence can be a burden. It also forces the reps to pitch a lot of useless sales ideas at the end of every month.
9828,5.0,None that I can think of
9829,5.0,No cons at all! Love this company!
9830,5.0,Environment is intense and sales has monthly quotas which is intense.
9831,2.0,"extremely cliquish for new comers. Employees are lifers and move around departments with little to no experience in new roles, then ignore expertise of outsiders brought in. VERY cutthroat environment. Wants results yesterday with no regard to planning."
9832,5.0,Cannot think of any cons at this time.
9833,5.0,"Now that it's much larger, a little harder to rise up as fast"
9834,5.0,They don’t pay as much as everywhere else for sales jobs.
9835,5.0,"The company is going through some intense growth right now and, as a result, you can tell that some are overwhelmed. There are many processes in place, but even they are showing some stress from the rate. While this isn't a deal-breaker, some patience is usually all that is required and the issues do get resolved."
9836,4.0,"At the end of the day, Salesforce is a software company, not a technology company. The senior people they hire are all from ex-Oracle, Adobe and that type of culture cascades down. Lots of red tape and people getting promotion that didn't deserve it so I left."
9837,5.0,"The company continues to grow like crazy and that comes with well known challenges. With all that craziness though, comes tremendous opportunity."
9838,1.0,People high UP misuse the company provisions travelling in first class to other office locations either to fulfill their pleasure trip (or) to meet their dates (or) to accomplish their private tasks.... Nobody scruitinizes their trip and expenses. HR as usual sucks up to higher management Women employees are discouraged from promotions No proper procedure on how people are promoted A single person can get 3 promotions in 3 consecutive years. Whereas a person working for 10 years may not get even a single promotion in the name of being incompetent . They can cook up any name for it. Often female employees are targeted.
9839,4.0,Hard to finish what was started from year to year.
9840,5.0,the pace of work is hard. you need to be ready for it
9841,3.0,Management treats employees like we work in a call center. Very tactical thinking
9842,3.0,"Strong emphasis on management training, poor execution. HR Issues go un-answered"
9843,5.0,- bluntness - decentralized employee comms leads to some mixed messaging - trying to keep up with its own growth
9844,5.0,None so far other than a lack of on-site parking but there are generous commuter reimbursements for using public transit.
9845,3.0,Easy to get caught in a turf war Managers promoted from technical staff - some try and solve people problems as if it were a coding exercise Product is a specific tool generalized to a platform
9846,5.0,"Pace is real, not measured in hours but in timeliness to make decisions."
9847,5.0,"Staying informed among the management chain changes. Lots of movement - all good things but definitely not doing a great job communicating those changes to employees first. I'm fortunate because I work in a department privy to that info, but to speak on behalf of other departments not close to HR, I know they feel lost and surprised too often. Many times creating unnecessary scares causing folks to prematurely jump ship - most boomerang back but k feel if we could get in front of this, we could reduce the boomerang rate. Additionally, RSU and overall stock grants to a limited number of employees. At my former employer, I was given RSUs off the bat but not here at SFDC and I've been here almost 5 years and in a fairly senior role. Not sure why that's the case. Colleagues feel the same and those good friends of mine who got stock are shocked I have none. Seems like a basic perk but it's not given to everyone :("
9848,5.0,"This is not really a con but could be a con if you are not an A player or used to being in a fast paced environment - We work at a very fast pace, heavily metrics oriented and with a high sense of urgency. I love it but not everyone likes or is accustomed to this type of environment. Unless you are in HQ you may hit a ceiling with your career growth."
9849,5.0,Pay is less than what industry standards would be.
9850,5.0,The pace at which the lessons move seemed so fast. More time should be spent on listening and speaking skills.
9851,5.0,-End of month and end of quarter is incredibly busy and there is a lot of pressure to exceed targets in last week of a period.
9852,4.0,It is extremely difficult to get in
9853,5.0,"- We don't get free lunches like Google but we did get most diverse workplace ... so you win some, you lose some."
9854,5.0,all things are very satisfying but free lunch would be good.... amount of rsu grant is very small..
9855,3.0,Culture is changing to be too churn and burn. Feels like SF.com is becoming Oracle
9856,4.0,Not enough SE's - we are leaving business on the table Long hours/not enough people in the right roles Lots of back office duplication - - leaders not willing to make tough choices Only execs get cars - not the doers
9857,4.0,"Not exactly a meritocracy, the self promoting bro's get the promos. More upward mobility available in other locations not in San Francisco."
9858,5.0,Based on my personal and professional experience there are no cons that I can speak about.
9859,2.0,"There is corporate culture and there's departmental culture. The corporate culture at salesforce.com is still one of the best in the industry but the influx of Microsoft employees (particularly leadership positions) in Infrastructure Engineering under Randy Kern and Ed Harris have promoted an extremely top-down culture which is the antithesis of what Marc Benioff and Parker Harris stand for. This has resulted in a high-level of attrition which has left the infrastructure team limping along, unable to attract top talent and unable to make demonstrable progress towards a long-term roadmap."
9860,5.0,None have come up so far.
9861,4.0,"Going through a big of a growth spurt and feeling growing pains along the way. If you're not in SF office, it can feel like you don't exist at times."
9862,5.0,Too much traffic downtown SF
9863,2.0,Management very rigid not willing to allow employees to shape their own careers. Upper level management often fails to understand the work that is being done because they are too far removed.
9864,5.0,"The company is growing fast and needs to invest in training for new people and systems and processes as it grows. Work/life balance is up to you to manage - you can do it, but you have to own it."
9865,5.0,Many days and weeks of long hours. Our group is greatly understaffed.
9866,4.0,Need more entrepreneurial projects that will push innovation
9867,4.0,"Too many changes all the time People, teams change directions very often and sometimes that can be frustrating"
9868,5.0,"Still operating as a start up. Lacking programatic approaches and there is a lack of fiscal responsibility. Another thing noticed is a lot of ""punting the ball"" as there is no accountability."
9869,5.0,"Pretty fast paced environment. I love it, but it's not for people who just want to coast along. Company has been growing really fast and office space is pretty tight."
9870,5.0,Could have been given more meaningful tasks
9871,5.0,None that I can see yet.
9872,4.0,Hard to say ... lots of info and ways to learn but sometimes locating key data is hard.
9873,5.0,"With a large organization, there will be people who slip through the cracks of quality. For example, sometimes good people leave to purse other projects they're interested in, leaving an opening for less talented people below to slot themselves in. This can disappoint other members of the team, but you just have to stay focused and do quality work yourself. People know who the good ones are."
9874,5.0,"Big company, big tape. Yes we still are the world largest startup, but there are process in place that will test your patience at times."
9875,5.0,Lunches or Dinner are not provided
9876,5.0,Very competitive and lot of politics
9877,5.0,Constant pressure to follow corporate message
9878,5.0,"Based on the projects you get, it can be boring or exciting"
9879,5.0,Big company has some red tape and can move slow
9880,5.0,Not always clear how we make an impact for the customer
9881,5.0,"None company-wide, however, I have a coworker who does not work well with others"
9882,4.0,"Difficult to keep work-life balance in check, demanding management/customers, lots of inflated egos. Losing its start-up feel and getting too big corporate."
9883,2.0,"Clear disorganization in middle management, lack of clear strategic direction for field organizations, lack of respect for employee work/life balance and lack of strong leadership at the mid-level"
9884,4.0,Since my time when the company was smaller and the culture was still fine I've heard that things have changed to the worse. This is somewhat natural given it's current size.
9885,4.0,It is not a startup anymore. Too much top down management
9886,5.0,"Only con is that you should live in the city, as commuting to/from the workplace could be bothersome. And there's no free food, which could be a pro for some :-)"
9887,4.0,Work life balance is poor
9888,4.0,Getting really big and corporate
9889,5.0,"Did not provide housing, gave stipend only"
9890,5.0,Big company headaches. Internal politics can slow things down sometimes.
9891,5.0,"not much...in sales, i believe there could have been more diligence done in how territories were cut, but considering the typical challenges when a company is acquired, this is a very, very small grievance."
9892,4.0,"Much focus on Velocity and my suggestion is to emphasis on Quality, teams still learning on service fundamentals, some of the engineering areas is little behind when compare to other tech companies."
9893,5.0,Not many come to mind. Sometimes a little too much red tape to get a decision made.
9894,2.0,"You need to close a certain number of cases, but some cases are much more difficult than others to close and the productivity formula does not take that into account."
9895,4.0,"Everyone, including SVPs, are micro-managed at Salesforce."
9896,5.0,"Large company stuff, have to find the interesting projects/teams"
9897,4.0,Management is rarely happy even when you close a big deal because they want you selling all of the products even when it doesnt make sense for the customer. They push product down customer's throats even though they call themselves a 'customer company.' Every month feels like it's end of quarter or end of year and managers care more about following the sales playbook versus helping you close the deal.
9898,4.0,"It can be hard to hang on in such a competitive culture. If you are not a top performer, it can be very challenging."
9899,4.0,As the company expands there seems to be some growing pains.
9900,2.0,"When I first joined this company 2 years ago, it was full of passionate people who cared about the company, the products, and most importantly, each other. Employee success was paramount to company success, and we had a leadership team that recognized that. Now, with the infiltration of Salesforce (which, don't get me wrong, Salesforce is great in its own way, but that greatness has not manifested in Indianapolis - it's been mostly destructive), the Marketing Cloud leadership team is much more concerned with making people like Marc Benioff and Alex Dayyon happy rather than creating a culture of happy employees. In a recent ""V2MOM"" session, leadership blatantly voted ""employee success"" as the LEAST important value among 6-7 value options. Don't you get it? Happy and successful employees lead to good product, good service, and thriving business!! As I look around, I see a bunch of people sitting there just doing bare minimum to collect a paycheck, others frantically trying to cling to the last bit of Orange culture they can find, and a select few who thrive in this new environment of ""nothing matters but the bottom line"". I'm sure that the short term business outlook will be great, as Salesforce manages to squeeze the last bit of quality work out of employees, but if this keeps up, there's no long term to speak of."
9901,3.0,A lot of things are unorganized
9902,3.0,"- Very self centered organization typical of marketing and sales. People find every opportunity to promote themselves shamelessly.. That kind of stuff is encouraged.. - Very ordinary Sales Leadership. No idea of what it is to sell to Enterprise. still works as if its selling widgets to mom and pop shop.. Very much a Sales and Marketing company that does not like a contrarian viewpoint. If you come from a Engineering or Technology organizations, its a huge challenge to even have a conversation.. Products are good but long on the tooth.."
9903,4.0,So many changes with in teams. You see all work you have done for an year can be scrapped with a simple decision. Too rapid changes.
9904,5.0,Selling the organization to Salesforce made sense but changed the opportunities within the organization.
9905,5.0,Bureaucracy a little bit but not too much
9906,4.0,"Office location culture does not match HQ culture, which is a big deal since that is the main reason for joining. Issue is around team co-operation and trust in people."
9907,5.0,Pace of change is exhausting sometimes!
9908,5.0,Fast paced work environment (Both good and bad)
9909,5.0,There really aren't any I can think of.
9910,5.0,"moves lighting quick, hard to keep up when your new"
9911,5.0,Processes make code commits lengthy.
9912,3.0,"Sales Strat and Ops is understaffed for the business growth and demands, resulting in poor work/life balance Heavy focus on reporting combined with hiring overly qualified candidates leads to limited opportunity to develop skills, especially for analysts Managers are often not fully equipped to be effective people managers"
9913,5.0,Lots of work. Many hours.
9914,5.0,Not working at HQ can make it challenging to get viz.
9915,4.0,Um... Thanks for the always-stacked snacks... lacked variety though. Would be great if they can serve lunch at the company
9916,5.0,"The company is reaching the point where it could really be considered a large company, rather than a medium one. As such, there are definitely some growing pains. Getting things like tickets resolved can take a long period of time, and there does seem to be some bloat. It's still a fantastic place to work, but does need to reevaluate as it grows."
9917,3.0,"Long hours in the office. But I was free to get up and stretch, grab food, hang out a bit. It was easygoing"
9918,5.0,I can't say there's much at this point.
9919,4.0,"Senior management could have been more judicious about some decisions. Also, a lot of politics behind the scenes."
9920,5.0,"It takes a bit of time to really understand what they are doing, but not really a negative but sometimes could be overwhelming for a new comer ..so just have patience and you will do well."
9921,5.0,"This is not a company you can coast at. It is filled with A players, so if you're looking for an easy ride, this isn't it."
9922,5.0,"As the company grows, the corporate ladder becomes difficult to navigate. Sometimes it's hard to create new roles or explore career options as roles become set in a certain pattern."
9923,4.0,can be a very political landscape. it is a boys' club and you have to fit in to advance
9924,5.0,"- The CEO and company are very outspoken in support of progressive causes. If you are politically a right-wing conservative, you may feel uncomfortable."
9925,5.0,"Every company has cons, but the pro's to working at Salesforce outweigh the downsides."
9926,5.0,"None, it was a good internship experience. I applied through FutureForce."
9927,5.0,"High growth often comes through acquisitions which can be stressful, no matter how good you are at doing them Getting a little larger and more bureaucratic Aggressive hiring leading to loss of pure SaaS evangelists (latecomers aren't as passionate about the SaaS model)"
9928,5.0,Sometimes not 40 hour weeks
9929,4.0,"Small territories, 10 accounts Politics Oraclization happening"
9930,5.0,"The training program for many positions is limited, which creates a more on-the-job-learning environment. This is fine for some, but others may have issues if they are learning something brand new. Also, I would like to learn more about the products even if you are in a service role versus a sales role."
9931,5.0,It is what you make of it San Francisco location is a downer Not everyone is on board with the culture
9932,4.0,Extablished career tracks/tracking are still being created.
9933,4.0,It can be long working hour for some. Reward may not tie to your performance.
9934,4.0,They should offer better salaries and better benefits.
9935,5.0,"Like any other large companies, there's going to be some bureaucratic overhead and siloing going on. While Salesforce does pretty well for a company of its size, it's definitely not a startup anymore."
9936,4.0,Difficult to move up or across functions due to the massive scale of external hiring. The startup culture is fading with scale.
9937,4.0,"cons will always depend on your group, team and manager"
9938,5.0,The company has grown quite a bit so you can feel lost in the shuffle or out of touch sometimes. Would like to see even greater transparency for the product roadmap and plan for the future.
9939,3.0,"The leadership here needs to provide management training to VPs. While the training AE's get is 2nd to none, the direct management and coaching falls extremely short. For example, 6 months in, I have yet to have any kind of a review or coaching. There's also a common thread of jaded sales reps here. For example, ""I took x account almost to the finish line, the fiscal year ended, and someone else got credit for the deal."" This is a systemic problem because I have noticed those reps no longer enter information into Salesforce..what's the point if you'll lose the client next year. Team building - really another surprising gap here. I'm sure San Francisco HQ doesn't have this problem. Too new to be offended but the above is real. We get the ""best company to work for"" but really its the ""best product to sell."" Which isn't bad but not great."
9940,5.0,Fast pace and at times people do not have a realistic understanding of timing for projects. Which makes you feel like you aren't able to shine at times because it is never delivered fast enough. This isn't always the case but mostly with T&P teams.
9941,4.0,"It's extremely fast paced. Your expected to be available most of the time, given notice. For instance, it's not uncommon to have calls with teams in other countries at night. I've been on calls that started as late as 10pm EST."
9942,5.0,No real cons as far as I'm concerned
9943,4.0,Pace. Culture is slipping from the ExactTarget days. Highly sales driven which makes life on the non sales teams challenging.
9944,5.0,Need better access to senior members as a remote employee and better pay scale for those in the Foundation. More opportunities to present in front of senior leadership
9945,4.0,Large organization with lots of process
9946,5.0,I can't think of any.
9947,5.0,"bureaucracy creeping in, losing focus at times"
9948,5.0,"Very fast paced, not really a con but for some it might be Lot of activities that you must do just to check a box and be a good corporate citizen Difficult Onboarding for new hires, drinking from a firehouse is an understatement"
9949,4.0,Too much red tape too many product features to keep track of in a unified way
9950,5.0,*pay could be better - benchmark against other top tech sales roles and it lags by about 10-15K
9951,5.0,- Growing quickly and process/the ways we work are becoming more complex & slowing down
9952,5.0,None. Great company to work for.
9953,5.0,Salesforce is a big company which means some bureaucracy. I think its's much better than most companies of its size but it's there. Make sure it's your cup of tea...
9954,4.0,"Growing into a major corporation, many jobs have more narrow scope than with a smaller company."
9955,3.0,"Difficulty managing tech debt, cross-team issues difficult"
9956,5.0,"Same as any other big company, bureaucracy."
9957,5.0,"Growing too fast, sometimes too many internal political work"
9958,4.0,A lot of big-company process.
9959,4.0,"Long growth path, very slow Favoritism for promotions Encouraged to work overtime regularly, very demanding job"
9960,5.0,None to name - all positive
9961,5.0,High expectations Monthly quota is SMB can cause you to lose site of relationship building and listening to customers
9962,5.0,I have not seen any so far
9963,5.0,"as salesforce grows, some management hires have been subpar"
9964,4.0,Salaries are lower than market
9965,4.0,Upward mobility was difficult to chart a path
9966,3.0,Innovation stifled by one size fits all initiatives

10000,3.0,"Salesforce's culture of innovation is being stifled by constant dictates from the top of the org chart that are constantly changing. Seasoned, well respected leaders are leaving in droves, particularly in the marketing organization. ""Marc says"" is how we make decisions now...so much for actually using our ""V2MOM"" to prioritize and reprioritize work. It's all about doing more work on tighter deadlines while only paying lip service to 'wellbeing'. It feels like constant chaos because we can’t stay the course on anything."

10013,4.0,transparent only what u should know lol
10014,4.0,"You need to have a certain disposition to fit in here. There's a sort of cult vibe going on that's hard to explain. Everyone tries to be positive about everything to a fault and questioning things is a no-no. Those that don't drink the Kool-Aid can feel alienated. Endless amount of training and distractions that had nothing to do with my job, and often interfered with getting the real work done."

Organization as a whole is extremely close-minded and not open to new ideas, contrary to the value of ""innovation""."

10069,3.0,"Salesforce loves to talk about how great they are and find it necessary to have a 60 minute all-hands call with executive leadership every single week. Most often, nothing important is communicated. This could be a personal preference, but I don't particularly care for the ""cult"" like culture Salesforce has.
