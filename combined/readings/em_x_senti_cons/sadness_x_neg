No matter what design implications there may be."
6386,"- No free lunches/dinners, like in some companies. Not really a ""con"" for me but for some people it might be. I prefer the vast array of real restaurants/food in the area over cafeteria food, but some prefer quantity/price (free) over quality so I thought I'd mention it."
