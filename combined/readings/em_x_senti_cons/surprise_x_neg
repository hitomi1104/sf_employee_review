714,"Unfortunately for a company claiming to have an keen eye on equality and trust, it lets a few things slip through the net: I was called aside following an evening out with colleagues whilst off campus. A department head had reported me after being open about my sexuality in a private conversation. I’m not sure why they felt that was necessary; I wasn’t given any specifics, only that it made them uncomfortable although they didn’t mention this during the conversation! Anyway a few days later I was summoned to HR and I was handed my notice. No warning. No chance to defend myself. It’s a pity because the pay was really good. The internal recruiter who hired me was lovely. The work didn’t seem challenging enough yet however and there was too much process and planning in my opinion. I guess you just have to be careful whom you confide in when you work at a big co. At least my new job allows me to bring my dog to work."
720,"The learning program is TrailHead and essentially ""learn by yourself"" methodology which can be tricky because the Sales Playbook is extensive."
751,"No real experience in advisory, building it up right now so can be challenging to work there, very technical background required, have to pass a lot of certifications that are not necessarily aligned to the type of job"

2396,Nothing that I can think of.
2410,"There was no transparency in how promotions were decided and very little feedback to help get you to the next level. Employee Success is a joke at this company. It was total chaos trying to get anything done with way too many cooks in the kitchen. If you're an older employee, don't expect any of your previous work experience to mean anything. If it didn't happen at Salesforce, it didn't happen at all. Compensation is definitely lower than the other big tech firms in San Francisco. Stop using so Hawaiian jargon and ridiculous costume characters. It's a business, not a pre-school. No stock refresh for grade 7's in ES, even though we were eligible under the plan."
2427,A lot of Surveys - not a bad thing

2485,A lot of products to cover with not a lot of time to fully grasps them. A lot will be on the job or just in time learning.
2490,"This used to be my dream job, I loved telling everyone I worked here and how awesome it was. Then as time went on, I realized it was all fake. The marketing team makes you believe that everything is perfect even when it's not. There is no way to move up even though people say you can. You will be promised one thing then later told the opposite. To move to a different role internally you have to move to a position of the same level or below, you cannot go up (called diagonally) in another department. Even if you make it happen, they keep you at the same pay and level for 6+ months so you will do more work for the same pay. There is NO INCENTIVE TO STAY!! I have known so many people who leave for this reason, then come back a year or so later 3-6 grades higher with better pay and benefits. Recruiters love that because they say it shows how great the company is that people come back, they could have saved themselves time and money by just promoting or transferring the person to the place they wanted to be at. My manager left after a few years and then they hired someone externally who had NO MANAGEMENT EXPERIENCE EVER!!! He was the worst manager I have ever had by far, he was rude, disrespectful, sexist, inappropriate, and completely useless. I was appalled at the way he treated his employees and when I brought it up to HR they basically said I couldn't prove it. Then other employees from a completely different department witnessed him scream at people and they went to HR and still the case was closed because ""lack of evidence"". Several employees were asked to work overtime without pay which is illegal for hourly employees. When I told my bosses boss that I was leaving, they offered me a promotion, but I would have had to move cross-country, and I was told there was no budget for moving costs, so I would pay them all on my own. As for salary, since it was a ""cheaper cost of living"" that there would be no increase. I laughed at this insulting offer to work more, have more responsibility and no increase in money while moving cross country. I declined the offer and they were somehow shocked. I left and never looked back, I am so much happier now that I left."

2577,not a fan of being acquired by a massive co with a slightly insane CEO
2602,It's big getting bigger... no so much a start up if that's what you're looking for.
2607,"When you get your job eliminated and very little notice, just out the door along with 90+ other people. I understand it was a 'business decision' but they went about it ALL wrong and THEY DID NOT HELP US FIND NEW JOBS THERE DESPITE WHAT THEY TELL THE PUBLIC."
2726,The apprentice program was a trick. they told us it was a job that gradually transitioned to a Sales Rep but its a lie. you have to interview and they only hire a select few on. The interview is pretty tough so its puts you in awkward place of having to find a job again

6330,HR process a bit unorganised. Takes a long time for someone in HR or IT to get back to you due to current process.
6341,"Red tape, big company woes. Often felt like management wasn't interested the careers of their direct reports and were too focused on self promotion. Small sample size though."
6346,"Constantly changed ROE, comp plans, internal hiring can be sketchy"
6350,"After three years here I had wanted to transfer to another department. I applied, and before it hit the hiring manager's mailbox, it hit my manager's mailbox first. How does that make any sense? The form I filled out said I would not have to contact my manager unless I was seriously being considered for the position. After my manager found out, he did whatever he could to make my job difficult and I eventually left on my own terms. Salaries are OK if you can get your manager to vouch for you. Many times folks are lowballed and get stuck at lower salaries for their level and they don't even know it. Happened to me and it happened to a few people I knew. It can be easy to negotiate upwards in these cases as long as you can show strong performance and navigate the company politically. As long as your directors are your best friends you will make great money. Promotions on the other hand are another beast. Some people I knew got promoted for no reason (other than being an SVP's best friend). As a high performer, it makes it very difficult because you work hard only to have other people get promoted because they can talk better than you, or go to more happy hours than you."

7075,"1. Poor onboarding of new employees. Esp. if you are part of a team that doesn't have a presence in Hyderabad or your Boss sits in a different office. 2. The recruitment team is not friendly/professional during the hiring process. The hiring process took almost 10 weeks and I had to call at least 10 - 15 times to remind them to release the offer (even the hiring manager confirmed I have been hired) 3. Information overflow (very poor signal to noise ratio). Sometimes you will be amazed at so many emails/chatter flying around you and you don't know what to do abou it. 4. The Employee Success Team (HR) needs to pull their socks up. As a new employee, I had faced several problems in the early days. I asked for help, but they were never there. It felt they just don't care."
7104,Hybrid development goals and training were not well thought out.
7133,there are no real cons I've mentioned yet
7174,"no transport facilities, observed lack of transparency from the managers"
7259,- some staff members were unapproachable
7283,No cons to list so far
7307,Can't think of anything
7310,It is a large company so sometimes there are lots of hierarchy's and it may take longer to get into a management role. If you prefer smaller tech startups then it may not be the place for you.
7330,Nothing that stands out as bad
7396,No cons to report on.
7413,Not much to say really
7440,under utilized skills but mostly just that
7474,Can’t think of any cons.
7476,Can't think of anything at this point

7517,Cons of the new tax plan
7551,I cant think of any cons
7552,No such cons found in system
7557,No such cons found in system
7582,Yet to find out. Just hired
7585,No cons found as such
7605,Tech stack is old still running a monolith hence developer experience is very poor half of the time you are fixing build issues
7621,"no cons at all, just work"
7677,no cons from what i know
7687,not any thing notable yet
7714,Nothing unusual for a bigger company
7717,The Chicago office is extremely competitive. They make you feel as if you’re going to be hired and they kick you out the door. Unfortunate. The employees are great but the management is awful. This program really needs to redo their management.
7728,There were large gaps of time between communications and interviews
7738,"Complete lack of transparency. If your manager tells you anything, you're likely not getting the full story. I'm guessing it used to be a great place to work, but the sheer size of Salesforce has made it impossible for anything to get done."
7755,I can't think of any
7777,"I was asked that question when I interviewed candidates for an open position and I had a hard time answering the question. There are the typical large company issues such as many groups to coordinate when working on something, a bit of politics and bureaucracy and a lot of processes."
7811,"Their core codebase is a nightmare to develop on. 30 minutes of build time to just fail out due to a minor build issue. And just because tests pass locally doesn't mean they will pass in the remote build, and you won't find out for 4 hours if you are lucky. This wouldn't be the worst if it was well documented, but everything is passed on via tribal knowledge, so if you are on a small team with maybe 1 engineer with tenure, pray they know what they are doing."
7846,"Middle management are in capable of leading the team. All they care about about is manage upward. My colleague was promoted to my manager and I found out that he listed down my work in his achievement list. What a joke. Besides that, he was trying to get a replacement for my pier and every candidate he shortlisted were Indian. Both external and internal OOM candidates. Downright racist."
7851,hiring process was a bit lengthy
7867,Can't think of any cons

7992,Not much worth a mention
8004,"If your boss is difficult, upper management won't care"
8016,can't think of any cons
8018,"It is a big company, and knowledge transfer is always tricky. I suspect that there is a bit of duplicity that goes on in engineering, and there are definitely things that parts of the business have learned that other parts of the business could be greatly benefited from but don't know anything about."
8022,I can't think of any thing.
8039,Too soon to share anything yet.
8149,There are no cons I could think of.
8176,Nothing bad to say here
8177,Can't think of any worth noting.
8188,"As a big company, it was harder to get things done. Executives are not always in sync. It seems they prefer to hire from the outside rather than promote from within. Lots of changes going on these days."
8193,I can't think of any
8285,Lunches or Dinner are not provided
8300,"When you get your job eliminated and very little notice, just out the door along with 90+ other people. I understand it was a 'business decision' but they went about it ALL wrong and THEY DID NOT HELP US FIND NEW JOBS THERE DESPITE WHAT THEY TELL THE PUBLIC."
8341,">> Data people (analysts, scientists, engineers) aren't given enough time or bandwidth by middle management to keep skills up to date. In other words, the best data talent that comes to this company sticks around for a year or two then leaves >> If you are a data person coming to Salesforce ... buckle up and get ready to solve SALESFORCE problems, not data science problems >> Data teams are super siloed and do not work together across orgs. This feels like a huge lost opportunity >> Tech is second to Sales at Salesforce. You aren't on the same pedestal you would be at other FAANG companies >> Data science infrastructure for some teams is surprisingly awful for what is supposed to be a tech company"
8345,"It is hard to find a con when you are genuinely so pleased with where you work. The usual cons, similar to any company would be the politics or bureaucracy."
8350,Typical organizational chaos ... i have worked on about a dozen projects in the last year that have not been finished for political reasons.
8354,"everything went really well, yay"
8382,Nothing bad to say here

8659,Cant think of any cons
8689,"Disingenuous during the application process: Said that they were hiring for a specific country and then changed the country halfway through the interview process. Others had the same experience. Work from anywhere doesn't really mean ""work from anywhere"""
8737,can't think of any really
8747,Nothing that I could think of.
