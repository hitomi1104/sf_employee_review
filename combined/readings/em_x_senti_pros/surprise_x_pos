I'm so glad a recruiter reached out and encouraged me to apply for the role that was a better fit for my skill level. We chatted on Google Meet the next day, and she then scheduled for me to meet with 5 managers. The interview was fantastic - it was a smooth and fun conversation where they got to learn about me, and I got to learn about Salesforce, the role I applied for, and a little about them as well. You can tell they really care about giving everyone a fair chance. I'm incredibly thankful to Salesforce and this team for giving me their time.

8512,"I had competitive offers from multiple companies, but I decided to go with Salesforce for a few reasons. What stuck out during the hiring process was: 1) I was a real person to Salesforce, and I really mattered. At another company in the Bay Area (which is widely considered to be *the* most prestigious company to work for... no specifics, but it's a search engine that starts with a G), I had an interviewer call me 1 hour late for an interview and 15 minutes late for the rescheduled interview, on top of telling me that their interview process was 6-8 weeks long and was totally inflexible. At Salesforce, on the other hand, every interview started right on the dot of the scheduled time and the hiring process was just under 3 weeks from beginning to end. I had to have special accommodations and stay an extra night after the interview due to a disability that makes it difficult to travel late at night, and they extended my hotel booking without any question. 2) All the employees are passionate about their work. This is because of a system called Open Opportunity Market where you are allowed to leave your team and join any other team with an open spot during releases. Basically, everyone does the job that they want and nobody is stuck in a role they hate. 3) Everyone is super friendly. My interviewers all asked me if I was comfortable, if I needed a break/anything to drink/a snack. Now that I'm here, I'm happy with the decision I made. I think my favorite thing about the company is that they are very open to change. Management really, really listens to what everyone wants, whether it's a change in development process or better snacks in the kitchen. The work/life balance is great - you can work remotely as often as you'd like and you can come in/leave whenever as long as you're productive. There's catered lunches all the time and a full-service coffee shop in the office. The parties are great (I was second row to see Metallica at a company party 2 weeks after I joined!) and the people are awesome."
8558,"Good benefits, nice work environment, most people are good there!"
8612,the process seemed to go very smooth
8621,Nice employer to work with
8622,"Nice new offices, cool hoodies"
8632,"Was debating between this company and a few other large tech companies in the bay area. Was blown away by the culture and people here. It sounds cliche, but the people here are really what made me choose SalesforceIQ. Everyone is social, intelligent, and extremely helpful. Onboarding has been smooth and the development pace is much faster than what you'd find in a traditional tech company. You get the best of both worlds within SalesforceIQ - a startup environment that has the stability of a large company. Compensation is highly competitive with the bay area. SalesforceIQ was definitely one of the best choice I've made."

8742,"TRANSPARENCY!!!! In only a month I've seen evidence of a level of transparency I've never seen in any other organization. - Benefits = best I've ever seen anywhere, good luck beating them - People = Almost everyone I've met is very happy to be there. My experience from recruiting to onboarding to bootcamp (sales training) has been amazing. I know it's the honeymoon period and I'm a little skeptical based on past experience but there's a part of me that thinks all of this is actually true - not too good to be."
