,cons
205,Not many cons I can think of
211,"Staying organized is a bit of a challenge but that is on me to figure out. With so much work and so many people to interact with, it is very tough to keep everything organized and straight. The tools are there, I just need to master them."
256,the larger it gets - hard to keep that entrepreneurial culture going
269,SO MANY RESOURCES AND NOT SURE HOW THEY ALL PLAY INTO THE JOB
277,"Does not have automatic annual stock refresh option but have base pay increase option based on performance every year, number of junior roles especially in Product Management are very very scarce, mis-matched networking opportunities for APMs hired with the program versus the ones hired outside the program."
314,SO MANY RESOURCES AND NOT SURE HOW THEY ALL PLAY INTO THE JOB
317,the larger it gets - hard to keep that entrepreneurial culture going
335,"no to say, this is great"
361,If any it’s that you will have too many resources!
426,nothing really comes to mind
436,none . I have only had positive experiences
466,No cons I can identify till now

594,None happy to come to work
622,It sometimes takes them until 9:30am to provide fresh fruit
631,"Salesforce is not for everyone - cultural fit is essential. I would recommend that you investigate what makes Salesforce different in our Ohana Trailhead badge. If it resonates with you, then join in!"
658,It's a very big company and its quite difficult to get to know everyone. There's a surge of information coming from all over the place so its important to time manage
667,"Really? Nothing. Maybe the location of the office but a new one in the city center is on the way, the largest of Dublin."
705,Nothing as of my current experience
744,"If you want to find a place that you can relax and makes easy money, this might not be your best choice."

1047,Hard to get noticed for your work
1049,Salary is not as competitive as what other companies in this industry offer
1087,"It is really hard to think of any negative experiences I have had at SalesforceIQ. Maybe the only thing is as new employees (as they grow in numbers), invest more with meeting people across the company."
1106,This isn't really a negative but be prepared to work hard and learn a lot. You are surrounded by some of the top students across the nation along with some of the smartest managers. It's a competitive company to get into. If you expect the best of yourself then you're in the right place.
1122,Can't think of any cons really - even with the growth of the company the culture has been very well maintained in my opinion.
1169,"At fist your might feel overloaded with the new information but don't get shocked, Take your time and do your best"

1439,"If transparency and collaboration aren't for you, this may not be the dream job you are looking for."

2598,"- Like anywhere, you can get lucky or not with a great manager -- most of my experience in this area was awesome - Depending on your group, hours can be tough at times"
2631,"Although engineering uses tons of open source software and tools, I wish Pardot & Salesforce ingrained it in the culture even more. Releasing official projects as open source could be done and encouraged more often."
2641,Not really any... I know people will always come up with something but it's a place where what you put in it what you get out of it.
2645,Sometimes when you work in a such a big company it's hard to get noticed for the value you provide and when it's as big as Salesforce it's hard to get assigned to work on truly strategic projects.

8001,* Not the smartest of folks on some of the teams.

8092,"Product team is very political but I think that's the culture. I hear that the Sales group is pretty cutthroat. Doesn't provide things like free lunch, so it's hard to get engineers.

8488,Nothing good place to show your skills
