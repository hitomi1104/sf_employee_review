0,4.7,"Working Hours/Holidays/Holidays: It's up to you if you can maintain a work-life balance. Employees are not forced to work overtime or work on holidays. However, until you get used to it, it takes a lot of time to work on each item, and the work doesn't progress at all, and as a result, you have to work late at night and on holidays. Once I get used to it, I think I will be able to finish my work early and take a good rest at my own discretion, but even if I see a veteran or manager, my status is online almost every day, even late at night. Impression that there are many workaholics. During working hours, I have customer support and internal meetings, and after hours, I have a schedule of checking information that is flying around the company, studying, doing customer research, and creating proposal materials. If these do not fit in the middle of the night, we will deal with the rest on holidays. Diverse work style support: Complete remote work during the corona period. Approval system if you have to go to work to respond to customers. Transportation is by taxi or private car, public transportation is not available. Public transportation will of course be available after COVID-19, but it is expected that people will go to work once or twice a week, and other shifts will be remote. Since it is performance-based and the restrictions on working hours are very loose, it is possible to pick up and drop off children from nursery school during working hours. However, it is almost impossible to finish all work in time, so many people work early in the morning, late at night, and on holidays."

2,5.0,"Corporate culture/corporate culture: I feel that the culture is not suitable for foreign companies, and there is an element of cooperation and cooperation with people around you to help each other. Evaluation is partly meritocracy, but if you have good grades, you will be rewarded accordingly, and there are some systems in place to improve your grades. Diversity/diversity: I think that the company places great importance on diversity. The male to female ratio is about the same, and there are many opportunities for women to play an active role. Regarding work style, there is no stereotype that it is natural to go to the office, and as long as you can work efficiently, you can choose to work from home or at a cafe on the go."
3,3.8,"Office environment: We moved to a new office from 2022. All floors are rented from Nippon Seimei Marunouchi Garden Tower in Otemachi. With a café space, a space-conscious collaboration space, and offices equipped with standing desks and high-quality office chairs, it is an environment that makes it very easy to concentrate on work. Snacks and drinks are provided, so you can cover even if you are hungry. You can also work from home, so you can use it for a change of mood. In addition to a wide range of Japanese-style spaces for visiting customers and conference rooms for 100 people, there is also a conference room for one person, so you can use it when you want to work without being caught by the surrounding sounds. ."

As for vacation, 20 days of paid vacation and several days of sick leave are available in the first year. Summer vacation is a form that can be taken freely from paid vacation. If you can rest, rest, and if you can't, work. Diverse work style support: You can work fully remotely. You can go home early without any problem. Since the amount of work is large, it is essential to be able to proceed efficiently, and the environmental support for that is substantial. The side job is unknown, but I have never seen anyone doing a side job around me."
5,4.9,"Working hours/holidays/holidays/holidays/holidays/holidays: new graduates have to study a lot, so I think that they often spend time studying even after work. Regarding paid leave, the application procedure is not so troublesome, and the image is that managers often readily accept it. Diverse work style support: Remote work has become the current mainstream work style. Of course, if you want to go to work, you can apply in advance and work at the company. Depending on the department, you can freely adjust the time you come to work after completing the work you are in charge of."

Organizational structure/Communication: There are plenty of chatter, Slack, web conference environments, etc., even during remote work, so communication is not inconvenient. Diversity: We focus on LGBTQ initiatives and employment of people with disabilities. In addition, there are subsidies for infertility treatment, etc., and there is an environment that accepts and supports diversity."
9,4.1,"Business strengths: Pioneer and global leader in CRM/SFA solutions using SaaS. Weaknesses in business: Expansion of business areas through M&A makes integration difficult. It is becoming difficult to secure personnel with both advanced technology knowledge and an understanding of the customer's business. Business outlook: Digital transformation will continue to grow in the future, but competition will increase, and the process for customers to decide what to choose based on what criteria will become longer."
10,5.0,"Salary system: An image of an inside sales department with an annual income of 5 to 8 million yen. However, since the basic salary is based on an annual salary system with no bonuses and is based on incentives, there are individual differences. The speed of salary increases also has a lot to do with individual performance, and the image is that promotions are based on results, rather than the culture of getting a raise after being employed for a long time. There are some people who change jobs to a closer position such as outside sales directly, but in the case of people with no IT experience, they can start from inside sales and reach a closer position in 2-3 years at the earliest. This is a blue sky and the success of the customer is directly linked to the salary."
11,4.3,"Working hours/holidays and holidays: Since it is a discretionary type, you have a high degree of freedom in structuring your working hours as long as you do what you do. Since study sessions are held after regular hours, participation in study sessions is almost mandatory until you get used to the work (especially for 2-3 years after joining the company). Considering self-study and preparations for the next day onwards, I think it is quite difficult to finish on time. Due to the characteristics of the IT industry, I think that many people are gathering information with their antennas up even on weekends. Diverse work style support: Currently, due to the impact of corona, remote work is the base. (You can go out if you apply internally)"
12,4.9,"Corporate culture/corporate style: I think it's an open company that values ​​culture very much. There is no sense of incongruity in what is written in various places. Organizational structure and communication: We have taken various measures, but I think the current situation is that communication between employees has become quite weak due to working from home. Diversity/diversity: I think we are more advanced than other companies because we are putting effort into this area throughout the company."
13,4.5,"Corporate culture/corporate style: There is an atmosphere where everyone fights together and celebrates success together.

Recognizing diversity and emphasizing equality for them."
14,5.0,"Diverse work style support: An environment where remote work is possible is in place, and basically it is almost telecommuting. You can work anywhere as long as you have a computer, mobile phone, and internet environment that you can borrow. I don't necessarily have to go to the office during the corona crisis, and I find it attractive to be able to freely choose how to work. Basically, I make a schedule based on a calendar, so there are fluctuations in how busy I am at work, but I think it is very easy to maintain a work-life balance, such as being able to spend my free time on my hobbies and lessons. I don't think so."

17,4.8,"Business strengths: I believe that we are the company that keeps the most customer information in the world, so this is our greatest strength. Business Weaknesses: We have acquired a number of companies, so I think the key will be product, company strategy, and organizational integration. In the long run, the SFA scenario may change as the world becomes more IT-oriented and the sales style changes. Business prospects: Business prospects are bright as the world continues to adopt IT."
18,4.0,"Working hours/holidays and holidays: Although working hours depended on the type of job, they were relatively free. Rather than that, there are many things to do, so the daytime is almost filled with internal and external conferences and meetings. Since it is necessary to study the company's services and the customer environment, I feel that there are many people who work outside working hours (even on holidays). Diverse work style support: Since it is a full remote work, there is no freedom to use time. It's up to you how you work because you're expected to get results."
19,5.0,Corporate culture/corporate culture: There is a culture of working together for mutual achievements. A wonderful system for sharing successes and failures in detail and returning learning to the team.

There is no housing subsidy, retirement allowance is managed at 401k, and general IT foreign office environment: We moved to a new office last year, and the atmosphere is closer to that of the head office, which is quite a privileged environment. The desk is spacious and can be raised and lowered automatically, and the built-in monitor is comfortable at 34 inches. There is a sweets corner on each floor and baristas on specific floors, so you can drink delicious latte and coffee."
21,4.0,"Corporate Culture/Corporate Style: As a company as a whole, many employees are engaged in volunteer activities because they advocate ""contributing to society."" While sharing the results of volunteer activities with all employees, we are expanding our social contributions. Organizational structure/Communication: All communication is done via Slack due to full remote work since the pandemic. Originally, there was also an in-house chat tool, and there were many verbalized communications. I think it will be difficult until you get used to it."
22,5.0,"Working hours/holidays and holidays: Since bonuses are determined based on performance, overtime work is not required unless performance is desired. Diverse work style support: remote work is basically free, easy to take, work requires autonomy, so work style is self-responsibility, boss does not instruct how to do side jobs, etc. are a problem maybe not"
23,4.3,"Business strengths: As a company that started with SFA, that is, sales support for B2B companies, this area remains strong. Weaknesses in business: I have the impression that it is becoming difficult to demonstrate strengths in areas other than SFA, where acquisitions are underway. It is difficult to demonstrate strengths in the B2C area, such as analysis, e-commerce, and marketing, because the B2B area is strong. Observed difficulty in allocating resources to acquire specialized skills"
24,3.8,"Business strengths:Because we are in the market leader position as a customer relationship management system (CRM), we can carry out client work based on our track record and trust. In addition, we are expanding our portfolio by acquiring peripheral solutions such as analytics, marketing, and API management. We will also collaborate with various experts to prepare them."

Diversity/Diversity: Seriously working on SDGs and LGBT"
27,4.9,"Corporate culture/corporate style: There is a lot of very positive communication, and the walls between departments are low. I feel that the culture of being able to immediately consult on internal SNS if there is a problem and receive knowledge immediately from a specialist who has never met face-to-face is noteworthy. A 1:1 meeting with the manager is also held closely, and advice is given according to aptitude. Due to the wide variety of products, product examples, and active knowledge sharing, it is a little difficult to catch up when you first join the company."
28,4.5,"Office environment: Very clean office with a global and uniform atmosphere. As part of the welfare program for employees, simple snacks and drinks are free. Equipment never runs out, and each floor has its own catering staff. The necessary equipment and resources are in place, and there is no shortage, so there is an environment where you can concentrate only on your own work. Couldn't ask for a better environment. As for personnel, it feels like the best elites are gathered. I have the impression that new graduates are attracting top elite and energetic people in Japan, so the level of competition is very high."
29,4.9,"Benefits: ESPP (Employee Stock Purchase Plan): You can buy up to 15% monthly. After Corona, it is a permission system to go to the office with an app (the number of people per day/floor is limited). After Corona, the repertoire has become lonely, but sweets and drinks are always replenished and fulfilling."
30,5.0,"Welfare program: Stocks for employees can be purchased at 15% off, so it is a very profitable system. Office environment: It looks stylish and has a comfortable working environment. There is a meeting space in every corner. Drinks and snacks are provided free of charge."
31,3.8,"Working hours/holidays/holidays: It is up to the individual to decide what constitutes a work-life balance, but it is better to be prepared for the length of working hours. There is a top-down atmosphere in the sales organization, and there are times when the degree of freedom is not very high. There is a very contradictory atmosphere that free work style is allowed by achieving results"
32,3.8,"Corporate culture/corporate style: There is an unexpectedly closed atmosphere, and there is a difference in how to deal with people who are achieving results and those who are not. There is also a scolding above. Diversity/diversity: I feel that there is diversity as a company. . ."
33,3.9,"Corporate Culture/Corporate Style: Employees called Ohana are said to be family members in Hawaii, but I haven't really felt that. I think there is a strong division of labor and there is a place where responsibility is passed on to each other. Diversity: I think it's very good"
34,4.3,"Working hours/holidays/holidays: The number of meetings has obviously increased due to remote work. There were things like meetings for the sake of meetings, and to be honest, most of my work ended with meetings, and I was able to enter as early as 7:30 in the morning. After all, there are miscellaneous affairs at night, and there are many times when I work until 9-11 o'clock. Diverse work style support: Side jobs are also possible, and it is easy to do there."
35,3.5,"Welfare: 10,000 yen/month for fitness fee assistance. Also, since I started working from home, I am grateful for the 5,000 yen/month subsidy for electricity bills. Office environment: Although the office is located in a prime location in Otemachi, it is recommended to work from home during the corona crisis, making it a comfortable environment to work in. The facilities are high quality, and you can refresh yourself with free snacks and massages."
36,4.5,"Ease of working for women: I think sales are hard work. There are people who are compatible with family life, but I get the impression that they are still in the minority. The image of other departments is that there are quite a lot of women. I've also seen some women in the sales department find the right timing and move to other departments. I think it's important to choose such an option to work for a long time. That's why the business is busy, micro-management, and has an athletic atmosphere."
37,5.0,"Salary system: Bonuses are determined based on performance.In addition, bonuses are paid monthly, which leads to motivation.If budget achievement continues, base salary will increase accordingly.Evaluation system:Promotion, promotion is for young members if their abilities are recognized. The number of management positions continues to increase as the organization continues to grow and expand"
38,3.9,"Education/Training: Because the number of successful cases in the past is increasing, in other words, the proposals of the past have become nothing more than horizontal developments. In addition, although there are many places for knowledge sharing and study sessions, there are many things that are left to the individual to catch up and establish themselves, so there are many people who are left behind and give up. I feel that the part that I can get is increasing recently. The number of people is increasing in the expansion period, and the number of new people in management is increasing, so there is still room for improvement."
39,4.5,"Salary level: Incentives are reasonably evaluated based on numbers and activities, so content is convincing. As for the base, I have the impression that it is treated very preferentially within the industry, and the theoretical annual salary is set high. When a position is assigned, it is rare to have more than one, and recently, the number of posts has increased along with the expansion of the organization. I don't see many people complaining about their treatment, so it seems that everyone is generally satisfied. Salary increases will be reviewed on an annual basis, but it seems that the grades are steadily rising, and the salary increases are progressing smoothly."
40,4.9,"Working Hours/Holidays/Holidays: I think the work-life balance is good. It's a discretionary work system, so when you're busy before making a proposal, you can be busy, but you can work with a good balance. There are also rules such as no business contact after 19:00 at night and on holidays. Diverse work style support: Fully compatible with remote work. It seems that the side business will be a permit system."
41,3.7,"Working Hours/Holidays: Closed on Saturdays, Sundays, and public holidays. Paid can also be digested. Working hours vary greatly from person to person. Remote work is possible. Diverse work style support: There are considerable differences between individuals in terms of remote work, going home early, etc. Since there are many teleconferences, there are times when I have a meeting with my home country, the United States, late at night or early in the morning."
42,3.9,"Education/Training: Knowledge sharing of past successful cases is actively carried out. This is true not only between individuals, but also within teams, departments and the company as a whole. A support system that is not often found in other foreign companies. In addition, since mid-career employees who have not joined the company for a short time are given generous study sessions on services, there is a relatively solid foundation for catching up. There is also a one-month training after joining the company, so there is an environment in place that allows people who are joining the company mid-career to play an active role."
43,4.9,"Working hours/holidays/holidays: Flexibility, but the amount of work that must be done to produce results is large. Emphasis is placed on equality of race, gender, family environment, etc., and the direction of freedom is strong."
44,4.9,"Working hours/holidays and holidays: After a certain number of years, the work-life balance is at a satisfactory level. Almost no work on holidays. We have high goals, but we have systems, systems, and products to support them. Diverse work style support: Remote work can probably be continued even after COVID-19 if desired"

Currently, remote work is the main thing in Corona, so the number of people who come to work is quite limited."
47,4.3,"Corporate Culture/Company Style: As the name suggests, sales are strong and the organizational climate is sales-oriented. Image of surrounding organizations centering on sales Diversity/Diversity: Compared to other countries, Japan has less diversity in terms of gender and race than other countries, but in this company, we are promoting women and hiring people with disabilities. continuing focus"
48,3.8,"Benefits: Stock options and shareholding plans benefit from the ever-rising stock price. Office environment: We have spent a lot of money on the office environment, and we are planning to open a new office in the fall of 2021. Our in-house cafe is always stocked with snacks and drinks."
49,5.0,"Diverse work style support: With the end of corona restrictions, it is now possible to go to work freely, but the model is 1-2 days a week, but only 20-30% of employees actually go to work. On a personal level, people who don't come to work once or twice a month, and people who do, every day, it depends on the person. We do not have the capacity to accept all employees coming to work, so I think this trend will continue."
50,4.1,"Working hours and holidays: You can choose to work from home or work in the office, making it very easy to control your time. Diverse work style support: Not only remote work, but also the management of working hours is left to the individual. I am very grateful that the autonomy of the employees is respected."
51,3.9,"Working Hours/Holidays/Holidays: Everyone works differently. It is strong depending on how far the project is involved. If it sells, you can control it, so the image of people who are easy to work and people who are hard work is polarized."
52,5.0,"Welfare: Welfare is almost non-existent Office environment: I think the office environment is a beautiful environment, and it's nice to be able to get snacks and drinks freely. You can get it (although the back office group gets it after all)"
53,4.8,"Working Hours/Holidays/Holidays: It's not exactly white, but overtime work is often less than 30 hours. If it's not sales, I don't often work on Saturdays and Sundays. Diverse work style support: Full remote, side jobs, and taking afternoon breaks are all possible. Able to work very flexibly."
54,4.1,"Gap between expectations at the time of joining the company and after joining the company: I thought that we were evenly penetrated by customers in each industry, but there is a considerable difference in sales performance between areas where we are good at and areas where we are not. Penetration into the financial industry is progressing, and inquiries from customers are increasing. The internal understanding of the acquired product is not very high, and the motivation is biased."
55,4.9,"Welfare: In partnership with a welfare company, there are wellness allowances that allow you to receive general massages and go to a sports club. meet"
56,5.0,"Working hours/Holidays and holidays: Around 9:00 to 18:00, but I have many meetings with customers during the day, and I prepare proposals after that. If the numbers are up, the way you work can be quite flexible. Diverse work style support: You can work quite freely, such as flextime and remote work."
57,4.3,"Working hours/holidays/holidays: Work-life balance is very easy to achieve Diverse work style support: An environment where you can freely choose a variety of work styles. A company that actively creates an environment where employees can work comfortably, such as remote work, flextime, and side jobs (requires application and approval)"

59,4.7,"Working Hours/Holiday Leave: Depending on the position, paid leave can be taken at any time. Diverse work style support: Depending on the position, it is possible to work from home. In principle, the support department works from home, and there are strict standards for coming to the office."
60,4.5,"Diversity: We have people from various industries in our inside sales and SME departments. On the other hand, the age of the enterprise department is relatively high, and the early 40s are the volume zone, and I have the impression that there are many people from foreign IT companies. It feels like IBM, Oracle, HP, etc. are almost occupied."
61,4.5,"Corporate culture/corporate style: An environment that demands more challenges and achievements. Diversity/diversity: As a company, we have a message that we value diversity, and this is actually being embodied through volunteer activities."
62,4.5,"Working hours/holidays/holidays/holidays/holidays/holidays/holidays/holidays/holidays/holidays/holidays/holidays/offices/offices/holidays/holidays/offices/holidays/holidays/offices Even mid-career hires are given ample paid leave when they join the company. Diverse work style support: Before COVID-19, WFH was allowed up to two times a week."
63,4.8,"Growth/Career Development: You can gain valuable experience through working at a company and develop your career. Motivation to work: In terms of salary, if you are producing good results, you are likely to be motivated to work. However, if their grades are poor, they feel that their work is not worthwhile."

67,3.8,"Ease of working for women: I think it depends on the department. There are women who are also raising children in sales, but I think it will be difficult for those who have a strong desire to balance work and family. Since we deal with customers and systems, we are busy dealing with sudden troubles and system failures."

70,2.8,"Working hours/holidays/leaves: Each employee has considerable discretion, so I think it's easy to balance work and life. Therefore, emails are flying around in the middle of the night, and it is questionable whether it is good for health. Diverse work style support: Remote work is the basis. The new office building does not have seats for all employees, so it is necessary to reserve a seat in order to come to work. Side jobs are also possible within the default, and some people are actually doing it."
71,4.5,"Working hours/holidays: [Taking long vacations] I think that our culture makes it easy for employees to take long vacations, as colleagues at the US headquarters and in other countries sometimes take long vacations during the summer vacation, Christmas, and year-end and New Year holidays. It seems that the sales are also taking a break for about a week, and they are helping each other for the holidays by acting as sales agents for each other. Temporary employees can also take long-term paid holidays if they are granted paid holidays by the temporary staffing company. Even if you are not granted paid vacation, there is an atmosphere in which you can consult about taking a long vacation as an absence."
72,4.6,"Growth potential/future potential: There are still many needs for services centered on CRM and sales support, and we will continue to grow. Also, in the digital marketing area, we are focusing on the B2C area, so we will accelerate our approach to the retail industry, which we have not been able to cover so far. It is also a factor that many excellent sales people are growing because they put a lot of effort into improving the skills of each sales person. In the future, I feel that the range of proposals will be expanded by aiming for a platform that collects customer information from all directions."
73,4.6,"Social Contribution in Business: The good thing about this company is that it puts out social contribution on all fronts. The model of 1-1-1 is affecting not only our company but also other companies. From the time I joined the company, I was told that it was important to volunteer, and I was given the right to spend 1% of my working hours. Each department has a staff in charge of promoting volunteers, and events are held so that they can actively participate. We often do off-site training, but we also carry out regular training and social contribution. We also clean up the area and support underprivileged children."
74,4.6,"Office environment: The office environment is a very nice environment. In the cafe space, you can drink coffee and drinks for free at a level comparable to that of shops. Rice balls and yogurt are also provided. The interior is globally standardized and has a comfortable environment. It's an environment that makes you want to invite customers here. Located in front of Tokyo Station, it is very convenient for commuting and business, and it is comfortable to go to the countryside. The reception is also polite and it feels like welcoming customers."
75,4.5,"Growth/career development: [When you feel growth] Your achievements are directly reflected in numbers and bonuses. Personal interviews with superiors and personnel managers are also frequently held, and at these times, employees can accurately evaluate themselves.

76,4.2,"Salary level: The salary level is quite high, isn't it? There are many incentives, and there are many factors that motivate employees financially.

However, until you get used to it, it takes a lot of time to work on each item, and the work doesn't progress at all, and as a result, you have to work late at night and on holidays. Once I get used to it, I think I will be able to finish my work early and take a good rest at my own discretion, but even if I see a veteran or manager, my status is online almost every day, even late at night. Impression that there are many workaholics. During working hours, I have customer support and internal meetings, and after hours, I have a schedule of checking information that is flying around the company, studying, doing customer research, and creating proposal materials.

Evaluation is partly meritocracy, but if you have good grades, you will be rewarded accordingly, and there are some systems in place to improve your grades. Diversity/diversity: I think that the company places great importance on diversity. The male to female ratio is about the same, and there are many opportunities for women to play an active role.

254,5.0,"Salary system: An image of an inside sales department with an annual income of 5 to 8 million yen. However, since the basic salary is based on an annual salary system with no bonuses and is based on incentives, there are individual differences. The speed of salary increases also has a lot to do with individual performance, and the image is that promotions are based on results, rather than the culture of getting a raise after being employed for a long time. There are some people who change jobs to a closer position such as outside sales directly, but in the case of people with no IT experience, they can start from inside sales and reach a closer position in 2-3 years at the earliest. This is a blue sky and the success of the customer is directly linked to the salary."
255,4.3,"Working hours/holidays and holidays: Since it is a discretionary type, you have a high degree of freedom in structuring your working hours as long as you do what you do. Since study sessions are held after regular hours, participation in study sessions is almost mandatory until you get used to the work (especially for 2-3 years after joining the company).

262,4.0,"Working hours/holidays and holidays: Although working hours depended on the type of job, they were relatively free. Rather than that, there are many things to do, so the daytime is almost filled with internal and external conferences and meetings. Since it is necessary to study the company's services and the customer environment, I feel that there are many people who work outside working hours (even on holidays). Diverse work style support: Since it is a full remote work, there is no freedom to use time. It's up to you how you work because you're expected to get results."

While sharing the results of volunteer activities with all employees, we are expanding our social contributions.

267,4.3,"Business strengths: As a company that started with SFA, that is, sales support for B2B companies, this area remains strong. Weaknesses in business: I have the impression that it is becoming difficult to demonstrate strengths in areas other than SFA, where acquisitions are underway. It is difficult to demonstrate strengths in the B2C area, such as analysis, e-commerce, and marketing, because the B2B area is strong. Observed difficulty in allocating resources to acquire specialized skills"

Diversity/Diversity: Seriously working on SDGs and LGBT"
271,4.9,"Corporate culture/corporate style: There is a lot of very positive communication, and the walls between departments are low. I feel that the culture of being able to immediately consult on internal SNS if there is a problem and receive knowledge immediately from a specialist who has never met face-to-face is noteworthy. A 1:1 meeting with the manager is also held closely, and advice is given according to aptitude. Due to the wide variety of products, product examples, and active knowledge sharing, it is a little difficult to catch up when you first join the company."
272,4.5,"Office environment: Very clean office with a global and uniform atmosphere. As part of the welfare program for employees, simple snacks and drinks are free. Equipment never runs out, and each floor has its own catering staff. The necessary equipment and resources are in place, and there is no shortage, so there is an environment where you can concentrate only on your own work. Couldn't ask for a better environment. As for personnel, it feels like the best elites are gathered. I have the impression that new graduates are attracting top elite and energetic people in Japan, so the level of competition is very high."
273,4.9,"Benefits: ESPP (Employee Stock Purchase Plan): You can buy up to 15% monthly. After Corona, it is a permission system to go to the office with an app (the number of people per day/floor is limited).

There is a very contradictory atmosphere that free work style is allowed by achieving results"

There were things like meetings for the sake of meetings, and to be honest, most of my work ended with meetings, and I was able to enter as early as 7:30 in the morning.

The facilities are high quality, and you can refresh yourself with free snacks and massages."
280,4.5,"Ease of working for women: I think sales are hard work. There are people who are compatible with family life, but I get the impression that they are still in the minority. The image of other departments is that there are quite a lot of women. I've also seen some women in the sales department find the right timing and move to other departments. I think it's important to choose such an option to work for a long time. That's why the business is busy, micro-management, and has an athletic atmosphere."
281,5.0,"Salary system: Bonuses are determined based on performance.In addition, bonuses are paid monthly, which leads to motivation.If budget achievement continues, base salary will increase accordingly.Evaluation system:Promotion, promotion is for young members if their abilities are recognized. The number of management positions continues to increase as the organization continues to grow and expand"
282,3.9,"Education/Training: Because the number of successful cases in the past is increasing, in other words, the proposals of the past have become nothing more than horizontal developments. In addition, although there are many places for knowledge sharing and study sessions, there are many things that are left to the individual to catch up and establish themselves, so there are many people who are left behind and give up. I feel that the part that I can get is increasing recently. The number of people is increasing in the expansion period, and the number of new people in management is increasing, so there is still room for improvement."
283,4.5,"Salary level: Incentives are reasonably evaluated based on numbers and activities, so content is convincing. As for the base, I have the impression that it is treated very preferentially within the industry, and the theoretical annual salary is set high. When a position is assigned, it is rare to have more than one, and recently, the number of posts has increased along with the expansion of the organization. I don't see many people complaining about their treatment, so it seems that everyone is generally satisfied.

Diverse work style support: There are considerable differences between individuals in terms of remote work, going home early, etc. Since there are many teleconferences, there are times when I have a meeting with my home country, the United States, late at night or early in the morning."
286,3.9,"Education/Training: Knowledge sharing of past successful cases is actively carried out. This is true not only between individuals, but also within teams, departments and the company as a whole. A support system that is not often found in other foreign companies. In addition, since mid-career employees who have not joined the company for a short time are given generous study sessions on services, there is a relatively solid foundation for catching up.

On a personal level, people who don't come to work once or twice a month, and people who do, every day, it depends on the person. We do not have the capacity to accept all employees coming to work, so I think this trend will continue."

Diverse work style support: Full remote, side jobs, and taking afternoon breaks are all possible. Able to work very flexibly."
298,4.1,"Gap between expectations at the time of joining the company and after joining the company: I thought that we were evenly penetrated by customers in each industry, but there is a considerable difference in sales performance between areas where we are good at and areas where we are not. Penetration into the financial industry is progressing, and inquiries from customers are increasing. The internal understanding of the acquired product is not very high, and the motivation is biased."

444,4.5,"Office environment: Because it is JP Tower, the office and restrooms are clean. Garbage collection patrols, plant care, and a vacuum cleaner after 19:00. One of the company's perks is free drinks and snacks."
445,4.5,"Growth/career development: [Knowledge and skills that are unique to the industry and occupation] Yes. It depends on the position, but depending on the position, there are many people who are doing cutting-edge things in marketing, so you can fight with knowledge."
446,4.5,"Job satisfaction: I am constantly inspired by companies where many people with career and motivation gather. There is always a sense of tension, but I think it is a very good workplace for those who are conscious of aiming to be a professional in any job."
447,4.5,Social contribution through business: We hold various events within the company to share information and knowledge. And we encourage a great number of volunteers to get involved. Each department actively participates and manages how much they contribute to society by numbers.
448,4.9,"Office Environment: The break room called the shop has bottled water, tea, carbonated water, milk, inputs, orange juice, coffee, you name it. Rice balls are also prepared, although not every day, and are very fulfilling."

450,4.5,"Corporate culture/corporate culture/organizational structure: [Exchanges between employees] There are frequent events in the company, so there is a place where you can interact. Depending on the department, there are people who think that they do not have to participate in such events because they are free people."
451,4.8,"Diversity: I hear that you are currently practicing the SDGs and accepting members of various races, genders, and nationalities."
452,4.5,"Welfare: Everyone, including employees, is worried that if they get used to this company where there is always food and drink, they will not be able to work elsewhere. But as a temporary employee, I don't really feel happy about benefits other than a well-equipped break room."
453,4.5,"Education/Training: [Employees who consult with us] Many people consult with us about work. Since there are many mid-career people with various backgrounds, there are usually people who can answer various questions in detail."
454,4.6,"Contribution to society through business: I think you are doing a lot. For employees, volunteer activities are incorporated as a part of their work. Some departments organize volunteers so that they spend part of their working hours volunteering."
455,4.5,"Corporate culture/corporate style/organizational system: [High employee motivation] They are very interested in their own work and are highly motivated. The knowledge and information necessary for sales are properly collected, incorporated, and put to use."
456,4.5,"Growth/Career Development: [Do you have a colleague/supervisor who is your goal?] My direct supervisor is a very capable person, so I would like to be able to achieve that level of quality, awareness of numbers, etc."
457,4.5,"Growth/career development: [Are there opportunities to convey ideas such as presentations and business negotiations] Yes, depending on the position, such as within a team, within a department, or between multiple departments, but I think there are. It just depends on the person's position."
458,4.5,"Growth/career development: [Is the environment required to improve work efficiency?] Yes. Anyway, I have to work on many projects at the same time at a high speed, so streamlining is a constant challenge for me."
459,2.8,Gap between expectations at the time of joining the company and after joining the company: I feel that the internal system and other aspects are lagging behind what I expected.

It is by the far best place I have worked in terms of learning from those around you.

The offices are decent, with fresh fruit and snacks available. There are a wide variety of career options available, both internally and also externally due to the expanse of the Salesforce ecosystem.

Of course, it is a fast paced environment which changes quickly and that can be demanding, but it's rewarded greatly and wellness and well-being is a very important component, next to our whole FUN value.

864,5.0,"Senior leader in HQ once said, many companies have an onboarding process that likens a rock tumbler. Salesforce's onboarding likens a car wash. Gentle and gets the same result. This has been my experience so far as a new hire. People around are always looking out for you to make sure you can cope. There's a level of trust and faith that you'll ramp up to be productive in the company. I'll list just a few reasons why Salesforce is the number one place to work. Culture- many of us would agree that it's challenging to explain what working in salesforce is like to those who are not inside, simply because it's rare to find a culture as unique as Salesforce'. When you're in the company, you get a sense of positivity day in and day out, everyone wants to get to know you as a person, it's not just work, it's the person behind the work. You will also feel that every single person in the company sincerely wants you to succeed. From the enablement team equipping you with tools and resources to succeed, to Employee Success (more commonly known outside as HR) taking care of your wellbeing, to your sales leaders leading from the front to win with you, the company's values of trust and growth resonates deeply in the employees. Salesforce is particular about who gets hired in the company. It's not so much of your competency (though it's important), as it is of your character and how you work with people. If you like to outsmart others and constantly seek personal glory, you're not going to have a good time. Leadership - I believe a huge part of the success culture in salesforce stems from the leadership team. Of course, salesforce hires great managers who can already lead and motivate team, but there's a proper coaching system which enables each employee to align with the direction of our leaders vision quickly, and also improve performance. Think professional athlete teams. Continuous training and learning - we get a ton of training and resources on industry trends, salesforce products, professional skills like giving effective feedback etc. There's a proper system in place for those who want to develop their competencies or gain more knowledge. Even staff who are here for many years benefit from the training and development programs. The fun 'stuff' - you get wellness reimbursements (some get gym memberships, some get supplements, you can use it for most physical activities). There're also many team activities and celebrations which makes work a whole lot more fun. We also have 7 days volunteering time off where you can do it with the team or on your own. Big shoutout to the team in Singapore for making Salesforce the number one place to work!"

941,5.0,"This review will probably come off biased as I've spent the last 8 years at SF and have grown my career with the company. I also met my wife at SF and we now have a lovely 2 year old daughter so suffice to say the decision to work here has proved a good one personally as well as professionally. I started fresh out of university with no idea what CRM or cloud computing was in a biz dev role, progressed into sales and am now a sales manager. Here are the top reasons I love SF: - upward mobility: the company is growing 30% YoY and with growth comes opportunity. I've held 6 positions in 8 years working here. - people & culture: I'm humbled on a daily basis by the people I work with. SF employees are smart, ambitious, fun and tend to genuinely care about the communities we work in and the world around us. There are exceptions to every rule, of course, but by and large we're a hard-working, fun-loving, high-achieving group that is just as collaborative as we are competitive. - pay: money talks! Compensation and benefits are top notch. For those in sales, the base pay will seem low but in 8 years I've never made less than 30% more than my OTE (base + commission). - trust: the vast majority of the people I've reported to have instilled a lot of trust in me to get my job done without interfering or micro-managing my day-to-day."

I spoke to many other institute for sandbox access. they told sandbox is not important. but I realised the importance of sandbox during my interviews.
945,5.0,Well respected brand. Attracts great talent. 1-1-1 model is more than just lip service. Interesting and challenging work. Benefits are some of the best I’ve ever received as an employee.
946,5.0,"Heroku has had its ups and downs over the last few years as it has become more integrated with the larger Salesforce org, but it still feels staffed by the best minds in the business, and I love the product that we make. Salesforce itself has all the pros and cons of a large org, complete with hawaiian culture kool-aid and large-org inertia, but on the whole it feels like Benioff puts his money where his mouth is on societal issues, in a way that few corporate titans do. They're generous when it comes to family and benefits and have a corporate culture of giving. Inside Heroku, we are still a little bit inside our purple-tinted bubble. On balance it feels like the engineers, junior to senior, are a standard deviation or two above the median. The problems we solve are difficult and satisfying. The business is large and the opportunity remains even larger. It feels miraculous that we operate a product at such crazy scale with so few people, and speaks to our expertise in building scalable, automated things."

972,2.0,"I loved the office in the tower. The verdant shrubbery, vibrant colour, frequent events and culinary freebies made it an eclectic space to work in. Unfortunately the 7 functioning floors were overcapacity by 200 people which made things a little tight and meant there was little space to eat and sometimes even work! The benefits are amazing. Loads of discounts, vitality health, company Amex and comprehensive expensing system. It really felt like a privilege to be there. The internal tools and external products are very robust. It seemed as though everyone was very tidy, intelligent and mostly friendly. The companies and teams are quite siloed though so it’s rare that you’d interact with many people. There are so many people that you rarely bump into the same person twice in the same week. there are apps and people for everything. The onboarding is quite slick if a little cultish. There’s a big emphasis on happiness and inclusion."

There are tonnes of technology jobs on offer around Dublin but from speaking with friends in other companies - salesforce offer one of the best opportunities to grow your career and bank balance. Don't get me wrong - I have seen some people take on the role of SMB and within 6 months it's obvious that they just aren't a good fit for technology solution selling. I personally have had to work my behind off and thankfully this year I'll be getting promoted to MM and I really look forward to the challenge ahead of me. If your considering a job with salesforce ask yourself 1. Do I want to work for the worlds most innovative tech company? 2. Does it matter if management really encourage me to give back to the local community and do some rewarding charity work? (It's real and trust me - you'll be overwhelmed by how good it feels) 3. Is career development really that important? 4 Could i spend €5K per year educating myself? 5. Would I enjoy working for a company that has a work hard/ play hard buzz? If yes is the answer then I really don't know of a better gig than salesforce.... FYI - the reason I'm using this forum right now is because my manager just did me a huge favour regarding my current promotion and this is my way of balancing the Karma!! it was either that or buy the guy some whiskey - this is the cheaper option :-)"

1345,5.0,"Coming into the summer with a couple different work experiences, SalesforceIQ provided one of the best internship experiences anyone could ask for. Emphasizing their values, it was evident that they placed a high importance on their people. The people at SalesforceIQ are some of the brightest, hard working and friendliest people you can work with. In a fast pace environment, interns are given the same responsibilities as full time employees - making you feel part of the team and contributing to the product. As an intern, not only do you get great experiences with other interns, but executives make time to interact with you and make sure you are invested in your few months as part of the company. This past summer was an internship I will never forget."
1346,1.0,Salesforce provides a ton of sales enablement material to learn all about digital marketing technology and you work with smart companies.

1348,3.0,"The foundation of why SteelBrick was a great place to work still exists in small amounts; great employees, caring and friendly environment, opportunities to move your career forward, etc. - Salesforce has brought on some nice benefits like Volunteer Time Off (VTO), and access to more resources about the SFDC ecosystem that we already lived in as a separate company. So it's been great for employees who were already passionate about this space. -Working at Salesforce now has opened doors to try out new roles in other teams and transfer internally. -Non-sales SteelBrick employees work out of a nice building in SF with great perks; free catered lunches, on-site gym, yoga classes, meditation, etc. Sales team works out of HQ SF office and enjoys being closer to core AE's."
1349,5.0,"100 times bigger than any other place I've worked, and I still get to do things I enjoy at small companies, like pick frameworks and languages I want to develop, wfh when I need and want to (usually 2 days a week).

1357,5.0,Highly ethical and innovative company. Our customers love the products we deliver. There is a strong commitment to diversity and equality.
1358,5.0,"Specific To Interns: Interns are given a lot of resources to both learn and have fun. There are about 1-3 speaker series every week for interns as well as other tech talks which are open to all employees. There were also so many fun events to help interns explore San Francisco such as a cable car tour, a small cruise ride, or street food tours. Overall Company: The company culture is fantastic. Salesforce is huge on doing social good and do a lot to help employees have a positive impact as well. For example, there is generous donation matching, hours of VTO (time off for volunteering,) and awards for employees who volunteer more. For example, the company has an internal Facebook-like system where posts are public to everyone and most communication / business is done on it. Every 4 months, there's an internal career fair where you can learn about other teams' projects and transfer to another team if you'd like."
1359,5.0,Wonderful environment where you want to go in to work every day. They treat you like an adult and don't hover. Do what's expected of you and you're in a solid place. And you'll have plenty of opportunity to do new things that you've never done before.
1360,4.0,"Hands down the best product in the market when it comes to Q2C. It's easy enough that even folks without any background in technology can competently set-up and maintain the application. While most competitors need to bastardize their application to ""make it work"", SteelBrick is all about out-of-the-box functionality which makes it a breeze. The market is hot to trot as well. Analysts indicate that Q2C is a massive, multi-billion dollar market by 2019 and even though we have 2x more customers than anybody in the space, we're only scratching the surface. The leadership team at SteelBrick knows everybody by name and works to build meaningful relationships - which goes a long way. Wellness plan covers up to $100 a month and working for Salesforce comes with a BUNCH of employee perks. Offices are moving downtown (and out of the suburbs) which I'm personally excited about."
1361,4.0,Nice salary awesome work life balance people are very nice and helpful. My manager was very supportive and offered lot of training sessions
1362,5.0,Salesforce is a wonderful place to work if you are lucky enough to work for the right manager. I think you can get the maximum experience of working at Salesforce if you are in the San Francisco office. I am in the NYC office and they are still trying to develop it to mirror the SF Hub. The pay for EA's at SF is on point with other competitive markets.
1363,5.0,"An amazing summer full of learning, fun, and hard work. The FutureForce team does an amazing job filling the summer with fun experiences (party on a boat, renting out all of SOMA Streatfood Park, a baseball game, and so much more) as well as learning experiences. We had lunch and learns from executives like the CFO, CEO of Heroku, and tons of thought leaders. What's really great about all of these experiences though is that it's clear the fun and learning is not just an opportunity for interns but for full time employees too. Throughout the summer, there was an all Tech and Product summer picnic at the zoo with included animal adventures and an amazing barbecue, a Summer of 99 party, and tons of lunch and learns with internal and external people presenting research. On my team I was able to contribute to features and bugs and was challenged and stretched but supported the whole time. I was able to demo to high level executives and definitely contribute real value. Another really unique aspect of Salesforce is their commitment to Ohana, or family. All of the employees, customers, and partners are treated with the highest level of respect. I especially appreciated the commitment to increasing diversity in the tech industry. One way Salesforce aims to do this is through the employee resource groups, like FemmeForce, BOLD, OutForce, and LatinoForce. Another way Salesforce aims to help the community is through volunteering. Every employee gets 56 hours to volunteer and we as interns were able to spend up to 56 hours volunteering as well! I was able to volunteer at an urban farm, a beach cleanup, and much more!"

1378,4.0,- Entrepreneurial company - employees are expected to find problems and then proactively fix them - Amazing commitment to giving back - to the community and employees - Tremendous execution of alignment through the V2MOM mechanism - Alignment is bi-directional - not top down.

1384,2.0,"- 5 months after my company was acquired by Salesforce, I was ultimately transferred to a manager who was very kind and understanding. Despite having my team thrown upon him, he tried the best that he could without knowing anything about us. He did not micro-manage and I thoroughly enjoyed working for him. I appreciated everything he did for me, but ultimately, he did not have enough power to change the situation. - I loved the people I worked with at my original acquired company and still got to work with them closely after the acquisition. - Good snacks and wellness benefits."

The company embodies a number of values, which they teach you within the first few months of being here among them include fun, innovation, wellness, and giving back. Those were the values that really drove me to accept Salesforce's offer over other companies. They truly integrate these values into their day-to-day operations. They offer generous VTO, and they genuinely encourage you to use them. Great perks, decent benefits & pay, and all-around amazing peers to work alongside. If you're considering joining as a new graduate, I'd highly encourage it. It's a fast moving environment, but you'll learn so much and it'll be a great addition to your career journey."

So many perks (tech companies are the way to go!) that you don't get anywhere else. Managers are very kind and hard working.

1424,5.0,"I've been at Salesforce for several years now after coming from one of the big 4 consulting firms, and it's been night and day! Although I was a top performer at my previous company, it was clear that I was disposable to them regardless and they would rather hire someone with less experience than try to retain me (my requests were not related to salary, but changes to projects and overall happiness). I provided a lot of feedback on how to improve processes and promote collaborative culture as other coworkers were feeling similarly, but nothing was done. At Salesforce, I completely feel as if I'm heard by management. I've transferred to several different teams with ease (in fact, after one year at the company they encourage it and create programs to shadow other roles). My managers are genuinely interested in progressing my career and enabling me to succeed and I've enjoyed working with all the teams I've been on. I've had a lot of flexibility to ensure I still have a nice work/life balance and that I actually get to use all the perks available! I personally use all of the $100 gym membership stipend (you can use it for massages too if you don't work out!) and the generous VTO balance (56 hours to volunteer at my local animal shelter, yes please!)."

I'm shocked at how well they go above and beyond for their employees and feel grateful to be at such a great company! Coming from smaller start-up types of companies, I was worried that moving to a huge company would be difficult and I'd feel like a robot BUT Salesforce has a similar feel to a start-up, placing you in smaller teams of people that you work alongside."

I've never joined a company and felt so welcome, as usually it's ""Oh right, you're starting today. Well sit there and we'll figure it all out"" This was the complete opposite allowing me to get right in and right down to starting my new job within hours."

1721,5.0,"Woven into the culture of Salesforce is both the strong desire to make the world a better place and the enabling of each employee to do exactly that. Volunteer time isn't a once-a-year event; it's seven full days of paid volunteer time every fiscal year. Colleagues (at least within my rather large extended team) are incredibly helpful. At least part of the reason is that we're encouraged to work cross-group, avoiding the ""silo"" effect. Salesforce invests heavily in maintaining its distinct culture as it grows rapidly."

1729,3.0,"Culture wise this is one of the best companies I have ever worked for. The people are great and their is a real team environment. People really want to help and do the best for the team and the customer. I've never seen another company close to this. Salesforce also follows a model that donates 1% of revenue, 1% of time and 1% of product to charity. As an employee, I get 5 days of Volunteer Time Off and charitable donation matches. It's also super easy for me as an employee to get that match and log VTO time. Salesforce is setting the bar in this space along with Patagonia. Salesforce is also trying to be sustainable and is a carbon-neutral cloud. . No other company can say that. Compensation aside this company is a 7 on a scale of 1-5."
1730,5.0,"Fast paced, lots of ambitious smart coworkers, great benefits. Salesforce acquisition has if anything improved career opportunities. Seems as though they are letting us do our own thing and letting Scott Dorsey remain in control of company decisions."

1746,5.0,"Great benefits, very nice culture. I have heard phrases along the lines of ""at least we're paid well to do it"" multiple times in passing now. There is a saying that if others at your company talk about being underpaid, chances are you're being underpaid as well. This place is definitely not the case."
1747,5.0,Been a great experience working with a group of dedicated and focused individuals. Ohana and the core values are truly the core and focus for all decisions
1748,5.0,Great culture Great people Great benefits Great perks Great name I’m a little more than a week into my new role at Salesforce and loving it so far.

1750,2.0,HQ offers nice perks for employees such as snacks and coffee.
1751,5.0,"I worked for both large and small companies, and even though Salesforce is not small (over 30000 employees and counting!) it does feel like one, rather than a megacorp. I don't know how they've been able to retain this culture for almost 20 years but it is definitely working! Salesforce does care about its workforce as a whole and every member of the family individually."
1752,5.0,"Everything you've heard is true - wellness reimbursement ($100/month), great benefits, up to 10% of salary bonus, commuter benefits, snacks/beverages complimentary, free work out studio and classes in SF, psychologically safe work environment, positive/energetic co-workers, flexible work schedules (WFH in some positions), inspiring leadership"

1755,5.0,"Everyone talks a good game about caring for their employees or feeling as though an employee is a part of a family. And, speaking from experience, that's usually where that sentiment ends...with talk. Salesforce consistently PROVES how much they care about their employees, their customers and their customer's customers. I have never worked for an organization that worked so diligently to provide a healthful, relaxed and comfortable place in which to excel. This organization is truly unique and truly head, shoulders, knees and toes above every other place I've ever chosen to be employed. They earn their ""Best Places to Work"" status every day and I am proudly soaking up the culture of inclusiveness, equality and contributing to the greater good. Happy days!"
1756,5.0,"Strong values, Employees always encouraged to do the right thing."
1757,5.0,"In my first 30 days this journey at Salesforce has been nothing short of inspiring! I have been in the workforce over 35 years, working for corporate America, small companies and large tech companies as well. Never have I felt so much enablement, support and encouragement as I have felt and witnessed here at Salesforce. I have always told my family, ""company culture"" is more important than salary and benefits."
1758,5.0,"Great onboarding. Amazing experience thus far. Heroku is a strong team, and is getting much more Enterprise focus recently. There's no wonder why Salesforce was voted Fortune Magazines #1 Best Company to Work For in 2017."

1765,5.0,"Volunteering and giving back is usually just feel good marketing but helping others is built right into the salesforce business model. The Volunteer Time Off policy grants every employee 60 paid hours each year to support their favorite causes, and this begins with day 1 orientation. One of the first things I did at salesforce was have breakfast with other new employees, and then hop on a bus to transform a community garden. This is only one example of how Salesforce has heart, but look to the many causes of our outspoken CEO Marc Benioff and you'll see Salesforce leads by example."
1766,4.0,Good product. They Focus on the customer And they’re all experience. People are very friendly and the CEO is very dynamic.
1767,5.0,"The 1-1-1 Model here (google it) and a tangible benefit that results of it is 7 full days of VTO (volunteer time off) to be used responsibly at your discretion. Matching gifts to a non-profit of your choice. - Benefits here overall are incredible - ESPP is attractive - Time off is generous - comp package works in your favor- i.e. hard work does in fact = revenue. - equipment is all up-to-date and excellent (iPhone as work phone, and MacBook as laptop) - Training that consists of bootcamp in San Francisco, and further training at a local hub. Ongoing trailheads and updates also keep you on your toes. - Fast-paced environment - Great culture - Talented professionals - Collaborative environment across different segments - Brand recognition - Smooth employee processes in the background (payroll, time logged, benefit tracking, incentive tracking, employee profile, etc). - Continuous acquisitions of companies continues to strengthen our products and offerings. - Snacks, events, and happy hours - Flexibility and autonomy given to consult with your clients - Networking opportunities here are endless"

I'm so glad a recruiter reached out and encouraged me to apply for the role that was a better fit for my skill level. We chatted on Google Meet the next day, and she then scheduled for me to meet with 5 managers. The interview was fantastic - it was a smooth and fun conversation where they got to learn about me, and I got to learn about Salesforce, the role I applied for, and a little about them as well. You can tell they really care about giving everyone a fair chance. I'm incredibly thankful to Salesforce and this team for giving me their time.

When the pandemic hit, Salesforce made sure that its employees were well-outfitted to work from home, and emphasized prioritizing mental health and balancing new work/life struggles. (Note that it wasn't all rosy, Salesforce also chose to do a round of layoffs during the pandemic, even though they were experiencing a record quarter, which caused a lot of controversy.) For as large of a company as Salesforce is, it is reasonably transparent. Employees have access to executive leadership, and have opportunities to ask them tough questions, such as regarding the layoffs they chose to do during the pandemic."

Tons of enablement and assets to leverage in selling, however a lot of the materials live in disparate locations making it tough to navigate. You work with a huge extended Salesforce army, many of which are specialists on a specific product so you’re not expected to be an expert on all solutions which is nearly impossible considering the amount of products you have to sell. You will learn so much here about the art of selling, they truly do produce some of the best sales talent. ESPP is nice, but so is equity which as a sales person you don’t get because they think your commission is enough but the reality is if you’re not meeting your monthly goals then you’re not reaping any of that “benefit”. Monthly wellness stipend is nice and so is the name recognition you'd get on a resume."

2629,3.0,"Quality work/life balance - This is baked into the benefits and culture. Although, you need a manager that actually supports this for you. If you have that it is great but, when you don't it can feel defeating. Personally, I have experienced the good and the bad with this. Training - Trailhead is a wonderful tool that provides a great introduction to many products/services. It's self-guided and you can pursue what interests you at your own pace. Time off to volunteer - Again a great benefit but, your manager has to be supportive of your endeavors. Employees are encouraged to give back using the 1/1/1 model. On one hand you are praised if you meet or exceed the number of hours you give back. If you don't have a manager or a team that does a lot of volunteer work, you might be criticized or singled out for ""wasting time."" Free Snacks - This is nice when you need a 3:00 snack or can't get out for lunch. Access to great perks - Wellness activities, a gym, workout classes, a benefit you can use to pay for massages. Unlimited vacation time, sometimes free tickets to events."

You have opportunities to learn and make yourself more competitive not just internally but in the greater marketplace. Everyone wants you to succeed. Marc Benioff is an incredible CEO and such an anomaly in Silicon Valley. I've never witnessed a CEO that seems so in touch with the world around them. He's so approachable and truly cares about the greater impact that Salesforce has on the communities it serves. His investment in the environment is one of the things that really drew me to Salesforce, specifically the Benioff Ocean Initiative. He's not just another talking head in Silicon Valley."

2693,4.0,"There are a lot of perks of working at Salesforce, at least for my role. I had the option of working from home and many people in my role did so as well. The office has open (""Ohana"") seating to accommodate that. This suited my personality well but if you prefer face-to-face meetings with your team members, this might be a negative for you. Throughout my time at Salesforce I had coworkers and managers that lived in different states than me. Which is fine nowadays considering all the virtual meeting options. There are free snacks and drinks in the break room. If you become a parent while at Salesforce, you have the option of taking up to 6 months paternity leave at 80% pay, which is outstanding at least by US standards. I never ended up taking the full 6 months for either of the kids I had while employed at Salesforce, I guess out of a dumb sense of duty to my coworkers and Salesforce. Don't do what I did. Take the full 6 months and don't regret it. I enjoyed all the people that I worked with and I had the opportunity to work with a lot of big name accounts. Overall I thought it was a positive experience. My role was eliminated which is why I had to leave Salesforce. I was not happy about it but they were very generous. After my role was eliminated and my role responsibilities were taken away, they continued to pay me for two months while I looked for internal and external opportunities. I was able to find another opportunity outside of Salesforce prior to the end of the 2nd month. Had I not found another role, however, they would have given me a generous severance package in addition to what I had already been paid. I would imagine that is a lot more than most other companies would do."

Management will set you up to succeed by providing all the resources, trainings, and other tools needed to make it to ""get to the next level"" and advance your career. I personally have no immediate plans to switch teams because I currently love the work that I am doing right now. I have seen people easily move across different teams and organizations (lateral and vertical) within Salesforce without issue. This is important to those that want to eventually work on different projects/teams/technologies within the company. The company promotes a lot of volunteering for employees and is consistently active within the community. It's recommended and encouraged for employees to volunteer and give back and they set a side a large amount of VTO (Volunteer Time Off) for you to do so. I absolutely love this because volunteering makes such a big impact to those in need. You are treated with dignity and respect working here. I have never come across any issues while working here but there is always an open channel to communicate with management (direct management or other management) if you do encounter anything. Senior management is very honest and transparent during meetings/emails/town halls, ect. with what is going on within our organization and company as a whole. Besides all of the stuff mentioned above, there are: - Excellent Work/Life Balance (I've never worked a weekend, I get off on time each day, and have never felt any stress while working here) . All of our work as a team is consistently completed by the deadlines too! - Unlimited opportunities to learn and grow your career with tools/resources readily available. (The company promotes enablement and provides you with a bountiful of resources to get to where you want to go in your career) It's just up to YOU to activity take initiative and take advantage of them! - You have the ability to take Professional Led Salesforce Certification classes for free - Tuition Reimbursement - Commuter benefits - ESPP - Amazing health insurance packages - Awesome views from the top of the Salesforce Tower - Ability to work from home every now and then (varies from team to team and role) - Baristas available in the main buildings to provide free handcrafted coffee and tea - Professional Chef's making food at the top of the Salesforce Tower and in Salesforce East - Arcade games, pool tables, ping pong tables, foosball, - Various ERG Groups to join (they do a lot of events that are fun and good for the community) - Social groups to join (Board games, video games, camera clubs, exercise/workout classes) - Lots of comfy sofas/lounge chairs - Access to the Salesforce Park - Awesome holiday parties!!! - HUGE Dreamforce event every year (Really fun and informative) All and all, this is absolutely the best company I have ever worked for and I currently don't have any intensions of leaving. 😃"

As a result, I have the opportunity to work with some of the most innovative, kind, smart, and hardworking people I've ever met. From leadership down, we all try to follow strong ethical values for our customers, for the community, for ourselves. One of my favorite things is how they always seem to be giving back. I feel like I'm a valued employee because ExactTarget thanks their employees. Not just verbally, once a year at the holiday party cramped into a break room - but with quantifiable actions, benefits, and rewards. • Growth opportunities that include yearly reviews with internal promotions encouraged • Career development courses, tuition reimbursement (up to $5000/year after 1 year at ET), mentorship opportunities, and a dedicated Talent Management team to support you • Networking opportunities (ie ExactWIN - our Women's Inspirational Network, ExactFun - They plan over 40+ social events like going to the Indian's game with the family, drinks and apps at Howl at the Moon, our annual holiday party at Crane Bay etc) • Volunteering opportunities encouraged by the company (6 Volunteering Days off/year, ExactImpact and ExactFoundation - organizations that participates in local service and grant opportunities with organizations like Gleaners, Habitat for Humanity, as well as local schools and hospitals.) • Reasonable time off. PTO: 15 days Holidays: 13 days • Strong benefits package including health, dental, vision, and 401k • Equity for Full Time Hires • Wellness Bucks: $100/month for gym memberships, personal trainers, sports lessons, and/or massages • Free 24/7 Gym membership, Bikeshare membership, onsite classes with options for yoga classes/cross-fit/kickboxing • Cell phone ($150/mo) and internet compensation ($50/mo) at managerial discretion • Flex time and telecommuting options • Lots of free things: free snacks, free good coffee, free drinks, free ""swag- bags, shirts, general stuff"", often free leftover catered lunches in the breakrooms and a free mobile app that tells you what we have, occasionally free sporting events (Colts, Pacers) and musical concerts giveaways • Casual and open work environment"

3046,5.0,"This company is growing and has rightfully earned many accolades. The benefits are fantastic, and you'll earn a lot of money if you're smart, motivated, and get things done. One key piece of advice that I have is to be proactive about your career. It can be tempting to code all day long, but you'll need to take a step back every now and then to chart your course over the next several releases to get ahead and stay in control of your career. If you don't, then others may put you into a direction that you might not like. Take charge and make your case to others, and resources will flow to you if others agree with your vision. That actually ties in well with my next point. Every year, each of us must create a ""V2MOM,"" which is Marc Benioff's method of distilling down what you want to do over the next year from both a high level and from a detailed level. You start off with a single vision, list your values, determine the methods that will realize your vision, identify the obstacles that may prevent you from realizing your vision, and create metrics that can measure how you know when you've realized your vision. Many people secretly blow it off and just copy their managers' V2MOMs, but if used properly, it really can make a difference in your own career. As one of the leaders had said, you get from it what you put into it. If you really embrace and use the V2MOM, you'll go far both at work and in life. The culture increasingly uses the V2MOM in its decision making and resource allocations. But don't worry; it's not a cult or anything remotely like that. Salesforce.com invests heavily in its employees. From the high-end office space to comfortable interiors, generous benefits, and firm commitment to meeting and exceeding workplace fairness, policy, and procedure rules and laws, anyone can be free to be themselves at Salesforce.com and do the best work of their lives. I know I am :). I'm an openly gay male, and that has never been held against me (as far as I'm aware, at least)."

If you manage your time and have a general interest in the technology there are tons of things to do. I've dabbled in product sessions, support workshop hours, custom app dev, etc. All while doing my day job. Because Indy is small most of the talented people in the area end up at ET.

I feel respected for my experience, and not pressured on my performance. We are all in the same boat, so we all have essentially similar expectations.

(Less than 1% of applicants receive employment offers) -Strong community environment: Salesforce has been able to build a corporate family unlike any company I've been a part of before. People honestly care for each other and will go out of their way to look out for past and present employees. Salesforce focuses on working as a team rather than separate individuals which develops a sense of inclusion. -Incredible parties: Salesforce certainly caters to a more extroverted, lively and connected personality by having frequent social and networking events throughout the year -$100/mth employee fitness benefit and health benefits that are largely absorbed by the company.

3998,5.0,"Joined the company about 6 months ago thinking I understood selling, and how to close business having spent 13 years in various AM & BD roles, but Salesforce takes the art of selling to another level entirely, and gives you the at-bats and the opportunity to succeed at every turn. They truly poured millions into learning and development, with more resources and training you could ask for or find anywhere else. Everyone makes you feel welcomed from the get-go, and there is a true mentality of ""we are in the trenches together"", where everyone is more than willing to help the new folks at the drop of a hat, because they've been there, and they care about their colleagues. It really is impressive. The compensation is lucrative, and the spiffs are insane! The office environment is very casual, and fun. Management, at least my chain of command, are in your corner and helping you whenever they can, and they do not pull punches (which I love), so you always know where you stand with them. They're tough, and so is the job, but more than fair, and highly rewarding."

4041,5.0,"Job Satisfaction , work-life balance"
4042,5.0,"Salesforce has a really solid business model, with a subscription-based approach to software that was revolutionary when it was first introduced 23 years ago. This subscription-based approach means that ongoing revenue can be relied on, for all customers that remain with the company. Since the attrition, or the loss of customers, is very low, this means that the cash flow for this business is very reliable and predictable over the long term. The company really strives to gain the trust and to ensure that customers are successful. These happy customers then become highly referenceable, and recommend our solution for others. Our product has become such a vital part of their business that it is also very sticky over the long term. As our company continues to acquire new capabilities, our solution becomes even more enticing and relevant, since we can address and integrate a broad cross-section of the needs of each of our customers (Marketing, Sales, Commerce, Service, Analytics). We deliver a comprehensive enterprise software solution, which is cohesive and integrated in ways that no other company can provide. In addition to this, we constantly think of ways to innovate and make our customers lives easier. We are able to digitize and improve the efficiency of a broad cross-section of enterprises out there who do not focus on digital solutions as their core business. All of these factors together represent a very strong opportunity for continued growth of this business. Salesforce has also been executing really well on surmounting many of the more difficult technical challenges that they faced due to the fact that the product is based on legacy code. There is technical debt related to the database, also there is a major migration underway to move to the public cloud. The company has executed incredibly well on these and many other challenges internally. The culture is incomparable. The leadership of the company have a genuine concern for each employee, and a real investment in doing the right thing for the community. The company takes a leading role in helping to champion initiatives that address homelessness and environmental issues for example. We also are really committed to the success of all of our stakeholders, including employees, customers, partners, communities, and all of the trailblazers who form the broader salesforce community. The ecosystem of administrators, architects and developers who are part of our space has continued to grow, and the company is also really proactive in helping to develop the skills of those people that might be interested in growing a career with our products."

The phrase ""Better, better, never best"" is a great way to describe the culture. - Individually in my customer-facing sales role, I enjoy being able to work with so many different types of businesses and executives. It's rewarding to help clients succeed, transform, and adapt their businesses - and it's also a fantastic learning experience for my own development. Because Salesforce has such a huge platform, we are enabled to have conversations with every business department and are empowered to deliver real value. While we are selling a technical product, working at Salesforce allows me to elevate the conversation by leaning on Salesforce's own internal success and leadership to inspire my customers. - There is a sense of pride in working here; there are just so many cool things about this company, it's hard to list them all!"

4425,5.0,"I started at Salesforce about six months ago as a fully remote employee. One of the most challenging things with any new job is getting ramped up to perform to the best of your abilities. Salesforce has blown away any preconceived notions I had of what an onboarding experience should be like. From providing me a coach during the interview process to that I am presenting the best version of myself and my skill set to an thoughtfully laid out onboard plan. I do understand that I may have a different experience than others because each department also controls a large portion of onboarding. However, I don't know of another company that spends 3-6 months ramping you in all the relevant areas you need to be successful at your job. Afterall, my success is ultimately the company's success. Additionally, I was paired with both a mentor who had been in the job for some time (12+ months) and a buddy who was only a few months ahead of me and can still remember all the struggles and challenges."

Let's start with the good: Great benefits, mostly great products, the pay is competitive (although reps are leaving for better pay more frequently), there is plenty of company culture kool-aid, and you can make pretty good commissions if you hit accelerators with the right accounts. Salesforce looks good on a resume, and if you don't like where you land at first, there is plenty of lateral flexibility within the company."

4465,5.0,Salesforce is a great place to work if you’re looking for work life balance! You’re encouraged to prioritize mental health and well-being in general. They’re flexible about remote work and if you need to work weird hours due to child care etc. This probably varies a bit from team to team but generally they really encourage employees to be humans first.
4466,5.0,"This is my 6 months of employment review. I am surrounded by strong women who are amazing team Leaders and workers. Management is fair and cares a lot. I'm not the best employee. I would consider myself incredibly average. I do feel that this is the first time in my career that my skills are accurately rated. I am given the opportunity to as they say ""level up"" with very detailed one on ones. This model only works for those who want to be better engineers and customer service agents. I never feel as if my caseload is too much. in fact, I have the free time to help my team reach resolutions and educate myself on my product. I really hope to retire here Before this, I owned my own business, and before that, I was a contract IT. I rather eat a whole brick house than work at any other company."
4467,5.0,"Salesforce has a really solid business model, with a subscription-based approach to software that was revolutionary when it was first introduced 23 years ago. This subscription-based approach means that ongoing revenue can be relied on, for all customers that remain with the company. Since the attrition, or the loss of customers, is very low, this means that the cash flow for this business is very reliable and predictable over the long term. The company really strives to gain the trust and to ensure that customers are successful. These happy customers then become highly referenceable, and recommend our solution for others. Our product has become such a vital part of their business that it is also very sticky over the long term. As our company continues to acquire new capabilities, our solution becomes even more enticing and relevant, since we can address and integrate a broad cross-section of the needs of each of our customers (Marketing, Sales, Commerce, Service, Analytics). We deliver a comprehensive enterprise software solution, which is cohesive and integrated in ways that no other company can provide. In addition to this, we constantly think of ways to innovate and make our customers lives easier. We are able to digitize and improve the efficiency of a broad cross-section of enterprises out there who do not focus on digital solutions as their core business. All of these factors together represent a very strong opportunity for continued growth of this business. Salesforce has also been executing really well on surmounting many of the more difficult technical challenges that they faced due to the fact that the product is based on legacy code. There is technical debt related to the database, also there is a major migration underway to move to the public cloud. The company has executed incredibly well on these and many other challenges internally. The culture is incomparable. The leadership of the company have a genuine concern for each employee, and a real investment in doing the right thing for the community. The company takes a leading role in helping to champion initiatives that address homelessness and environmental issues for example. We also are really committed to the success of all of our stakeholders, including employees, customers, partners, communities, and all of the trailblazers who form the broader salesforce community. The ecosystem of administrators, architects and developers who are part of our space has continued to grow, and the company is also really proactive in helping to develop the skills of those people that might be interested in growing a career with our products."

5092,1.0,"Salesforce is the best company to work for but due to some people, the standard is going below. Good work culture, good benefits. You can grow well if supported by your manager."
5093,5.0,"I joined Salesforce Singapore as my first job fresh out of university, and truthfully, it's really the people that make this place an amazing place to work at. Different teams will have different ways of working for sure (dependent on the manager), but overall I find colleagues here willing to share their time and expertise. Even as a junior member of the company, I was never made to feel afraid or hesitant in approaching a more senior colleague for advice. There is a lot of trust in my team, which has been especially invaluable in this whole work-from-home situation. The autonomy and flexibility granted in my role is also surprising, but practical I suppose – considering how large the company is growing, it's difficult for a manager to micro-manage the activities of every single team member. The remuneration package is fair (not top-of-market however) and comes with lots of benefits. Most importantly, managers in Salesforce are super supportive about lateral movements within the organization, and outside of it. Telling your manager 'I would like to seek a new challenge this year' is not taboo here. I've lost count of the number of colleagues who have changed roles over the past 2 years I've been here."

They really do care about helping the community and equality for all. I’m truly proud to work for a great company. Being an SE out of San Francisco, we get the perks of having HQ with the amazing building amenities, cafes, snacks, fitness classes, access to product teams and leadership, technology kiosks, and conferences and marketing events such as Dreamforce, TrailheaDX, summits, and kickoffs. Although it may vary by team when being out of HQ, we still get the flexibility to work remotely which is nice since the SE role can be very demanding. The role continues to challenge me and provide tremendous growth opportunities. In this role I get opportunities to continue to learn new products almost every six months and get certified, improve my public speaking skills, and network with executives from all the customers I work with. I get the perks of traveling (and also get paid for it since I’m hourly) which is different than consulting travel because it’s 2-3 trips a month usually for 1-3 days and mostly localized to the west coast."

Bonus, stock options (both RSUs and ESPP), generous 401k policy, plenty of PTO, 3 months of paternal leave (even more for mothers), sit/stand desks, free snacks / drinks, free food pretty often - Work/life balance is not perfect but a big step above other companies I have worked for. Your free time is for the most part respected (emergencies non-withstanding) and in my experience no one feels judged for using their PTO or VTO. - Many companies talk the talk in terms of diversity, but Salesforce walks the walk. They famously fought discriminatory laws in Indianapolis and unilaterally gave raises to ensure female employees were paid at the same rate as their male counterparts (without forcing pay cuts on anyone). They also strive to have a diverse board of directors, though I think this still needs work. - All full-time employees receive 7 paid days off (in addition to normal PTO) to pursue volunteer opportunities - and, again, this is actively encouraged. - Most managers do not have a ton of direct reports, meaning you can build a good relationship with your manager. - Career changes are not only permitted but encouraged. Some areas of the company have annual job fairs for lateral moves if you are not happy. In my case, my manager started to talk with me about where I want my career to go before I had even started to consider it. - Right now, great job security as the company is growing like crazy - which is great if you're used to consulting work."

Part of orientation involves volunteer work at a local charitable organization; in fact the company gives you an additional paid week off each year to devote toward volunteer work. Benefits are excellent, and include fitness expense reimbursement ($100/mo) in addition to full medical, health and dental. My division buys the entire office catered lunch twice a week, although that perk doesn't apply everywhere. Managers are fair, and don't ask their employees to work to exhaustion. The company is growing at a rapid pace, so there is plenty of room for growth and advancement. Finally, there is the name recognition that comes with working at a prestigious company. Salesforce.

6349,5.0,"Salesforce's culture has consistently exceeded my expectations time and time again. Salesforce truly acts in the best interest of their employees, instead of only focusing on shareholders. This has become even more apparent during the COVID-19 pandemic. Salesforce quickly and efficiently shifted to having all their employees work from home to protect their safety, began weekly company-wide calls with the executive leadership team so employees are always away of updates across the company during COVID, financially supported employees' home office setups, made numerous additions to the benefits plan to adjust to COVID-19, and continually prioritize employee wellbeing during all these changes. Salesforce talked a lot about ""Ohana"" or ""family"" in my interviews, I'm so happy to say that culture they talk about to candidates is genuinely the culture we all get to experience day-to-day. It's everything I had hoped, and more!"

6446,5.0,"Salesforce was the first to pioneer Saas, and is the leader worldwide today. This is a fantastic platform to sell, that is known universally, and is adopted for a reason. The product works, and it works well. This is a product that any AE can be confident in, and for me being confident in what I sell drives my success. Further, Salesforce takes care of it's employees. I've been blown away by the pandemic response. Salesforce is not only a place that a strong AE can make a lot of money, it's a place you know where management stands. Salesforce management publicly came out and said there would be no lay-offs(there weren't), and pro-actively rolled out programs and incentives to take care of employees. Salesforce is a place you can grow your career, and you can constantly learn. With all of the acquisitions, you can switch to a new product that interests you, or pivot into leadership. I've worked a number of places in my career, and Salesforce is the best so far. There are absolutely downsides, which I get into below, but for me personally I plan to be here for the foreseeable future. Frankly, I believe in Salesforce's leadership team and strategy. We are making some incredible acquisitions and are positioned to be the undisputed cloud leader in ten years."

6457,5.0,Best Company to work for
6458,5.0,"Honestly I thought people were just ""drinking the Kool-Aid"" from the reviews posted, but this large company lives and breathes their culture & values. COVID put all companies to the test and Salesforce reacted with their employees (and customers) first and still continues as the pandemic stretches on. I have been incredibly impressed at everything they have done and continue to do to make sure we still make money, keep our health and family life in mind, and over communicate so we know exactly what is happening inside and outside of the company. COVID aside, the people they hire are all really talented and a culture fit so you are working with incredibly smart people that want to help you succeed even if they don't benefit at all. I don't think I've run across one person yet that hasn't offered to help with anything I need now or in the future. The bar has been set incredibly high and I don't see myself making a move to another company anytime soon, even if I was offered more money. I am happy at my job and feel really supported and am encouraged to take breaks or days off to recharge. Highly recommend!"
6459,5.0,"Working with amazing leadership, innovative tech leader, approachable and down to earth management, a company that cares and wants to do right by their employees. Great benefits - the best maternity benefits I’ve seen."
6460,5.0,"Salesforce has offered so many amazing benefits for interns. Allowing them to contribute 56 hours of VTO throughout the summer, matching 6% towards a Roth IRA, and giving a housing stipend are some reasons why Salesforce has been a great place to work for. This is always a company that prioritizes education and is always finding ways to improve employee skills."
6461,4.0,It is a laid back culture
6462,4.0,"Salesforce is a great place to work, for a lot of people a lot of the time. My perspective is mostly from consulting services/CSG, but there are some things that apply across the board. -Excellent focus on work/life balance. Better than anywhere else I've found in terms of consulting or engineering jobs. -Excellent salary. My title maps to ""senior manager"" level as an individual contributor, and all things considered I am extremely satisfied with it. -Health insurance is excellent, in terms of coverage/cost/options. One of the better plans I've seen. -401(k) is excellent if you're an investing wonk. The match tops out at $5k which is middle-of-the-pack, and the plan is through Fidelity (meh) with which you get a good selection of funds, but more importantly, BrokerageLink to invest in the wider markets, and the ability to contribute after-tax beyond the 402(g) limit and auto-convert to Roth with 1 phone call to set this up. This is relatively new in the marketplace, and still rare. Tl;dr is you can contribute as much as $52,000 to your plan for 2020 and characterize as Roth in the end, not $19,500, regardless of your age (research ""Mega Backdoor Roth""), which is a huge benefit for financial planning for highly-compensated employees. -Working for Salesforce comes with a lot of cachet within the world of software vendors and partners, and access to awesome tools and information. If you've been a consultant or worked for an ISV and geek out to the product, you're going to love it here, and often be able to get involved with really interesting clients, projects, and internal initiatives shaping future product development."

6530,3.0,"80-90% of the employees you’ll meet are some of the best people that you’ll work with in your career. If you’re just starting out, this is a great place to gain some relevant experience and build your resume. When it comes to benefits, there are stocked pantries on every floor. Those working in Indy have access to the ET Gym, ET Fun events (golf outings, paintball, happy hours, etc.) and more. Wellness Bucks - employees are reimbursed up to $105 per quarter for gym memberships, yoga classes, crossfit classes, etc. Through the Salesforce acquisition, ET employees receive 6 free volunteer PTO days per year and even have the opportunity to participate in the Salesforce Employee Stock Purchase Program. Until recently, it was fair to say that ExactTarget had one of the best executive leadership teams in all of SaaS."

6533,2.0,The products that Salesforce sells are innovative and they work. Marketing is also very strong.
6534,4.0,"The best product by far...bar none. The best visionaries, technical ops (the guys that keep the platform up and running), and internal platform engineers on the planet - these are the guys that deserve all the glory. What is done behind the scenes to keep the app going is nothing short of amazing - several million concurrent users while constantly adding functionality and innovating...and no down time? Come on. It's ridiculous. The tenured and long-timers that are still around are incredible. They're not only the best in the company, they're the best in the industry. Prove yourself to them and they will take care of you. If YOU have the drive and the ability, you can build a career path in the company...and if YOU make a case and have something behind it, it's one of the few companies in the world that will allow you to do so. Salesforce will not give you a map when you're hired that shows you a career path...but if you succeed in the role you're giving and prove yourself and earn trust, they'll actually allow you to create your own. The culture of the company is like nothing else in the world. Yes...you are expected to work more than anywhere else in the world...but if you like philanthropy, no questions asked...go do it - on company time. The best in the business keep coming on board. Marc is the best CEO in the business - different for sure - but the best. For a few years I thought the company had plateaued...several different times (at $750M...at $1B..at $2B...)...but I really do see this company making it to $10B in rev and beyond. Without a doubt. So if you're considering joining Salesforce but are worried about growth, don't be. That should be the last of your concerns."

6660,4.0,"My first few months with Salesforce is good. I've worked in the field for 10 years and been at companies ranging form large corporations to a small startup. I read some of the one star reviews and think people might have different experiences on different teams or people just have different expectations. As for my own experience, compared to the companies I worked for in the past, Salesforce is a good company to work for. It offers above market salaries but also asks you to work hard for it. No doubt the amount of things to learn at the beginning is overwhelming. Luckily new employees are offered plenty of formal training classes. Everyone on the team is ready to help, too, because they got tons to do and really want you to be able to contribute. The company is growing fast so politics might get worse. But don't kid yourself. Wherever there are people, there is politics. I once worked at a 50 employee startup and had to deal with the constant BS going on in the office. Find a good manager who can shield you from a lot of this if you are a technical minded person. And the company allows you to jump between opportunities if you don't really like your current team and/or manager and they can't hold you back. My previous job was at a large software company, where an internal transfer took at least a few months...an offer letter can take up to 6 months for it to go up the management chain and get a headcount...the quality of software was a mess because the management only cares about metrics and spreadsheets and no idea what they were building. So far I haven't seen the same problems at Salesforce. The scrum teams are very small and agile. They do expect you to do real work very quick but working 10-12 hour shifts is not typical."

6667,5.0,"I just joined Salesforce.com, and my experience has been excellent in every way. The onboarding process has been a breeze because the company uses the tools they sell which allows new hires to get up and running quickly. Specifically, the company uses Chatter groups where employees can find virtually all the information they need for any questions and get immediate responses, rather than spending 6 months trying to find out ""who does what"" within their new company. Furthermore, everybody I speak with seems to love working here and the company culture is very positive and supportive of employee success."

If you're able to juggle being harassed by a co-worker every five minutes on IM, e-mail or phone and can still get productive work done, you may like it here. You'll learn about about Agile development and how it can really work - in spite of the fact that group managers ignore the great recommendations of the agile training team. During your first few weeks, do some careful analysis on the source code you'll be working with. There's a sense at the company's that it's somehow infallible and should not be questioned. If you disagree with that view on solid technical grounds, you'll be able to quickly determine whether or not you want to stay on. So, that transparency is a good thing. The software release process and software upgrade process is good. So, you'll learn a lot about that. Training is pretty good, but corporate policy has many self-conflicting points."

The leadership that came from Atlanta was very charismatic. I recall times when the VO Sales would jump on a call with a prospect at the 11th hour remotely at the oddest time to help regional teams. Who does that? It’s things this you will always remember. In terms of people, when you find a core group of individuals whom you trust and can lean of for advise and support, it goes a really long way in otherwise a very demanding role"

7289,5.0,"Heroku has had its ups and downs over the last few years as it has become more integrated with the larger Salesforce org, but it still feels staffed by the best minds in the business, and I love the product that we make. Salesforce itself has all the pros and cons of a large org, complete with hawaiian culture kool-aid and large-org inertia, but on the whole it feels like Benioff puts his money where his mouth is on societal issues, in a way that few corporate titans do. They're generous when it comes to family and benefits and have a corporate culture of giving. Inside Heroku, we are still a little bit inside our purple-tinted bubble. On balance it feels like the engineers, junior to senior, are a standard deviation or two above the median. The problems we solve are difficult and satisfying. The business is large and the opportunity remains even larger. It feels miraculous that we operate a product at such crazy scale with so few people, and speaks to our expertise in building scalable, automated things."

7305,5.0,"Salesforce is an awesome place to work. I was fortunate enough to work with few teams in Salesforce during my tenure. Demo Engineering was one of them so when I heard about some rumblings about this team, I thought of sharing my perspective. DE is one of the most amazing teams in Salesforce to work. It houses some of the best talents from the Industry with diverse cultural background. If you bring two things to the table talent and right attitude then irrespective of your gender, age or experience you get the spot on this team. I’ve seen leadership bring in lot of fresh talent with almost no experience but with right attitude. Also there have been cases when folks with not-so-great english were also given opportunity solely based on their talent. How to use technology to bring transparency in an organization is something one should learn from Salesforce. From number of demos you worked on, number of hrs you logged or even number of times your received appreciation, everything is open and accessible at each level from your peers to top global leadership. DE Team is entrusted with task of delivering successful demos where you are racing against time. There is lot of support and encouragement not just from leadership but even from within the team. During my initial days, team helped me learn and get up to speed with work. Whenever I was stuck with anything, team was just a call away. I’ve never worked in a team with such strong sense of ownership till now. During my tenure, India team was leader among global teams in delivering most number of successful demos. There is lot of focus from on your professional and personal growth. I’ve seen people getting nominated for various technical and leadership trainings. Also, Salesforce was kind enough to identify and sponsor trainings for folks who face challenge in communication. You are encouraged to create your own development plan keeping your talent and aspirations in mind. Leadership helps create various growth opportunities for each team member. There is guidance and coaching available for each member. I've seen successful transitions from this team into various roles within Salesforce and even outside. In their pursuit of giving back to society, Salesforce encourages each employee to volunteer. They not only provide paid time off for such volunteering activities but also give hefty sum of $2000 as a grant which each employee can donate. Volunteering activities are available throughout the year and employees are free to choose them as per their interests and beliefs. DE is one of the few teams in Salesforce where each team member proudly achieves their volunteering goals every year. Salesforce provides flexibility of work hours and work from home. Each team defines their own schedule and work hours keeping healthy overlap between their global peers. DE work hours in India are 9-5. At times you are required to get on a call with global peers late evening or early mornings but the folks are always considerate of the fact."

Reimburse 3.5L per year of tuition in case you want to pursue continued education outside! LOTS of holidays! Free amazing unlimited food and drinks 24X7X365. Also did I mention they provide an iPhone and MacBook to EVERY employee along with unlimited 4G internet connection?! The office has a mindfulness room to practice meditation, space for nursing mothers, board games, Pingpong tables, air hockey tables among other things Culture: Colleagues are warm and friendly. I have barely finished a week here and I already have friends and plans made for a movie, team lunch and weekend! Everyone is helpful, non judgemental and open. As I work in a global team with my colleagues across the world, the diversity is mind blowing. One of my colleagues is an actor in movies, the other one has travelled to 29 countries, my super boss was a part of a very famous American TV show in her young days!! There is lot of stress on wellness and being fit with bike month, running challenges as well as on giving back to the society with fun team volunteering events right from Day1. As a leading technology company, the systems are integrated with a SSO and user friendly Career and Development: They stress on developing careers right from Day1. There are many trainings conducted, articles on their blogs and trails(online learning). Also the networking opportunities are immense. It's great to work with the smartest people with diverse backgrounds and learn from each other. Also they have a fun themed office space with cute mascots printed on walls, furniture and just about everywhere!

Most customers and new leads are happy to speak to Salesforce. - Great earning potential, obviously if you are doing well, but even if you aren't, product spiffs and bonuses can help towards making your OTE. - Benefits cover almost everything you can think of. Highest education reimbursement I've seen in tech companies. Base pay in esmb could be improved, but it depends where you are in life if you value the cash or benefits more. - Room for promotion (it can be slow, but no slower than most big tech companies). - A no brainer move if you aren't already in the tech industry- one of few tech companies that seems to be open to hiring non tech sales backgrounds. A lot of the cons below happen everywhere so you may as well benefit from Salesforce's great benefits and commission. - Their selling methodology isn't for the faint hearted, but you genuinely will learn a lot about selling."

This is true for how we care for our customers, employees and the communities and world we live in. It’s truly remarkable to see 17,000 people rowing in the same direction. From “Day 1” to today I continue to be impressed. Growth and innovation run through the DNA of the company. Which gives it the feeling of a 16-year-old start up & creates exciting opportunities for individual career growth. Exciting to work for a company with this type of trajectory. Performance of our industry-leading products results in very happy customers. And our customer list represents the world’s greatest brands in every industry vertical. The culture is unlike any other company I’ve worked for. As a sales person, it’s great to know we view “sales is a team sport” and “no one wins or loses alone”. And the teams I get to work with are made up of the top talent in every discipline. Compensation is great and the benefits are exceptional."

Salesforce is a place where they, hands-down, take care of their employees and customers. I'm shocked at how well they go above and beyond for their employees and feel grateful to be at such a great company! Coming from smaller start-up types of companies, I was worried that moving to a huge company would be difficult and I'd feel like a robot BUT Salesforce has a similar feel to a start-up, placing you in smaller teams of people that you work alongside."
8022,3.0,"Marketing Cloud offers a ton of great solutions. They are (mostly) fully integrated, which many competitors can't say, and the individual solutions are leaders in their respective areas. The former ExactTarget culture still exists to an extent but is fading over time. Marketing is a growing area in most companies, so there is plenty of room for growth. Being a part of Salesforce is a benefit from a company values perspective. The 1-1-1 model makes me proud to work for an organization that gives back."

8238,2.0,Great company 3 years ago. Then it tripled and went to the wolves. Work life balance is good. If you wanna sit and grow at a steady pace then it's great. Don't expect too many merit based incentives. Some free lunches. Easy to switch teams parallely. Vertical movement is easier for management. Horizontal movement is extremely scrutinized (they would rather hire inexperienced interns than in-house and train someone for a position) Company stocks are great. Bonuses are ok.

For those skeptics, I've been around the block with some top tier Chicagoland companies - they don't even compare to the culture, daily responsibilities. career mobility, and pay that you get here.

8362,5.0,"I have been at Salesforce for over a year and the experience has been nothing short of outstanding. The biggest pro's that I have found about this company is that it takes a tremendous amount of pride in being the best. The focus of ongoing training both internal & external is top notch. The hiring process is very engaged, thorough & challenging, even if you are referred, which lends to the talent that you work alongside. The job has grown my professional skill set ten fold, especially in my business & selling acumen. From a selling perspective I would describe the pay and OTE to be undersold and over delivered vs. other sales jobs that sell you on high OTE's that almost always fall short. Amazing culture, amazing job, selling a platform that is the world's most innovative and good pay is why I love working here."

8436,5.0,"This company has a buzz, or pulse, that I can not really describe exactly. It has both young and old but both are equally energized. The customer base is solid and the company has critical mass to become a major force in cloud computing given the Salesforce1 Platform and extended clouds. Corporate values are as solid as they get, and they enforce the values, which is a very needed change from my last employer. It is one thing to talk, it is another to walk. A big draw for me was the 1:1:1 charitable focus. When a company commits stock to their foundation from day one, it speaks volumes to the values. Also, the company has a firm commitment to personal growth, that is enforced. Nice to see the teeth in the process. But they give you all the tools you need to be successful."

8512,5.0,"I had competitive offers from multiple companies, but I decided to go with Salesforce for a few reasons. What stuck out during the hiring process was: 1) I was a real person to Salesforce, and I really mattered. At another company in the Bay Area (which is widely considered to be *the* most prestigious company to work for... no specifics, but it's a search engine that starts with a G), I had an interviewer call me 1 hour late for an interview and 15 minutes late for the rescheduled interview, on top of telling me that their interview process was 6-8 weeks long and was totally inflexible. At Salesforce, on the other hand, every interview started right on the dot of the scheduled time and the hiring process was just under 3 weeks from beginning to end. I had to have special accommodations and stay an extra night after the interview due to a disability that makes it difficult to travel late at night, and they extended my hotel booking without any question. 2) All the employees are passionate about their work. This is because of a system called Open Opportunity Market where you are allowed to leave your team and join any other team with an open spot during releases. Basically, everyone does the job that they want and nobody is stuck in a role they hate. 3) Everyone is super friendly. My interviewers all asked me if I was comfortable, if I needed a break/anything to drink/a snack. Now that I'm here, I'm happy with the decision I made. I think my favorite thing about the company is that they are very open to change. Management really, really listens to what everyone wants, whether it's a change in development process or better snacks in the kitchen. The work/life balance is great - you can work remotely as often as you'd like and you can come in/leave whenever as long as you're productive. There's catered lunches all the time and a full-service coffee shop in the office. The parties are great (I was second row to see Metallica at a company party 2 weeks after I joined!) and the people are awesome."
8513,5.0,"Company is still in hyper-growth mode. Still building FIELD sales model, so I see alot of opportunity. Company invests weeks of time and money in on-boarding new employees, including a week-long trip to HQ in San Francisco to get a first-hand look at the culture. Selling a platform now, so sales is still SFA focused, but so much more to offer to customers today."
8514,5.0,"Great company culture, products, and family. Amazing conversations with customers on how to transform their business. Culture of teamwork, change the world attitude. Lots to do but everyone pulls together to make it happen. Dreamforce is a game changer. We run the company from our products. Gives pace and transparency. Love it here. Best job in my career."

Thank you Glassdoor for having the ability to leave truly anonymous feedback on any company regardless of race, religion, sexual preference or association."
8666,5.0,"The Ohana culture at Salesforce is truly unparalleled. You will often hear Marc Benioff state, ""Business is one of the greatest platforms for change"". This statement resonates with me most because we really do live this mantra in every way - internally and externally. We are encouraged to give back to our communities and support our schools (often referred to as the future leaders of the world). We support non-profit organizations and the list of good will we do goes on and on. We help our customers connect with their customers in a whole new way - making a positive impact on their business. We truly are setting the bar for how all Companies should impact positive change in our world.

""Embarrassment of riches"" on full display. - 1-1-1 model actually taken very seriously. Employees regularly do a lot of good things for the benefit of the community."
8680,4.0,"The best product by far...bar none. The best visionaries, technical ops (the guys that keep the platform up and running), and internal platform engineers on the planet - these are the guys that deserve all the glory. What is done behind the scenes to keep the app going is nothing short of amazing - several million concurrent users while constantly adding functionality and innovating...and no down time? Come on. It's ridiculous. The tenured and long-timers that are still around are incredible. They're not only the best in the company, they're the best in the industry. Prove yourself to them and they will take care of you. If YOU have the drive and the ability, you can build a career path in the company...and if YOU make a case and have something behind it, it's one of the few companies in the world that will allow you to do so. Salesforce will not give you a map when you're hired that shows you a career path...but if you succeed in the role you're giving and prove yourself and earn trust, they'll actually allow you to create your own. The culture of the company is like nothing else in the world. Yes...you are expected to work more than anywhere else in the world...but if you like philanthropy, no questions asked...go do it - on company time. The best in the business keep coming on board. Marc is the best CEO in the business - different for sure - but the best. For a few years I thought the company had plateaued...several different times (at $750M...at $1B..at $2B...)...but I really do see this company making it to $10B in rev and beyond. Without a doubt. So if you're considering joining Salesforce but are worried about growth, don't be. That should be the last of your concerns."
8681,5.0,"Salesforce.com is a hidden gem from an employment perspective. I am sure it looks like Siebel on the outside to some people (just another CRM software company). But it's a company on a mission. With 10,000s of employees you cannot avoid the usual bureaucracy, but the company is strongly driven by mission and I think that is huge."
8682,3.0,Foundation 1-1-1 model; HQ being in SF; interior design of office spaces; clear opportunity for promotion as a high achiever; company's creativity in rolling out new products and expanding the platform is notable

8687,5.0,I am working for Salesforce for the past 3 years. So far I have not seen any valid point for me to make a move to another company. - Compensation is good compared to its equivalent companies - Great benefits and perks - Work-life balance is very good - Management helps employees to grow in their career - More innovative projects coming up which gives me a chance to learn the emerging technologies - Company does a lot of volunteering activities to support the society and people in need of help - Great culture and values which is why I hope this company is rated as the best place to work

8693,4.0,I truly believe that salesforce wants new hires to be immersed into the company culture and buy into the desire to be very good corporate citizens of whatever city you happen to live in.

Many employees have long tenures, and usually will not leave as they love the supportive environment that Salesforce creates for their employees through excellent benefits and opportunities for growth. It's refreshing to work for a company that truly puts weight behind words at the top levels. Unlimited PTO is great, and the flexibility to work from home is fantastic, most if not all tech companies should have these perks to keep up with the job market though."

8731,2.0,"- 5 months after my company was acquired by Salesforce, I was ultimately transferred to a manager who was very kind and understanding. Despite having my team thrown upon him, he tried the best that he could without knowing anything about us. He did not micro-manage and I thoroughly enjoyed working for him. I appreciated everything he did for me, but ultimately, he did not have enough power to change the situation. - I loved the people I worked with at my original acquired company and still got to work with them closely after the acquisition. - Good snacks and wellness benefits."
