The on-going pandemic has really brought to the fore front the huge advantage of SalesForce as a company that actually support employees. Recently I needed to drop a project to be with a sick parent.

What's worse is that it appears that the HR folks are either powerless and so they go along or they are in on it. Several coworkers described experiences of being horribly berated by hatchet folks in HR based on ""complaints"" that HR would not clarify or explain. They described being pulled onto phone calls and told they have to ""apologize for what you did"", and when asked what they were talking about, would be told ""it's impossible that you don't know what we're talking about and if you don't then it's even worse than we thought."" Some have hypothesized this is how Salesforce rattles employees they, for whatever reason, decide they want to leave ( inside scoop indicates this is another maneuver by some VPs to create ""opportunities"" to shape an org the way they want when they get key folks to self-select out) but have no reason to push them out or worse yet, the employees were actually considered high performing by prior managers. I highly recommend anyone considering Salesforce to stay away unless it is the best you can get because its a huge company, if you get on the wrong side of just about anyone it could get really bad for you and there is nothing you can do.",24 people found this review helpful

So if you are not comfortable advocating for yourself and sometimes shouting your wins from the rooftop you may not want to work here. This is very true in Marketing, perhaps not all other BUs. - While diversity is a core a value, Salesforce like most tech companies are not as diverse as they think, so something to keep in mind if you're a minority.

These 2 points might seem trivial, but you will spend quite a lot of money on Luas and food, trust me, not to mention the time lost when commuting Career progression is there BUT it is extremely slow, which means it also takes a lot of years to move out of Dublin if you want to stay with the same company (4/5 years) It takes a lot of networking to move between functions (BDR to SE or CS) Harsh split of fixed and variable salary in AE roles (50-50) Level of stress always depends on the manager you get There’s not much of a fun element at work, besides the people, who are for the most part lovely and motivated. But no fun company kick off abroad, no cool off sites abroad, no happy hours, no end of quarter drinks... just compare it to other big tech company like Linkedin and Google - it’s much more boring The WFH policy for sales dev is non existent (1 day/month). Pretty ridiculous when this is an EMEA HQ and people are coming from all over. Allow people to go home and work from there to see their families, without having to take PTO all the time.

272,25,Incredible company & products - Increasingly farcical sales roles,"Nov 20, 2019 - Account Executive in Dublin, Dublin",4.0,"Being the market leader across a wide range of solutions is an enviable position to be in. Customers are typically willing to discuss and engage with you based on our reputation alone. There are some highly intelligent and capable people right throughout the organization. This means that projects and evaluations can become very creative and the standard of work is typically incredibly high. It is by the far best place I have worked in terms of learning from those around you. The benefits are second to none, including health insurance, gym membership, fertility/adoption allowance, generous maternity/paternity leave, a degree of informal flexi-time. The offices are decent, with fresh fruit and snacks available. There are a wide variety of career options available, both internally and also externally due to the expanse of the Salesforce ecosystem. Altruistic culture runs right through Salesforce and is truly ""lived"" as opposed to being just talked about.","There is a real lack of cohesion to the sales organization. When you first join you are pretty left to fend for yourself and see to your own integration. The sales targets are completely ridiculous and the compensation plan has been making it more difficult to make money every year. This year I am going to make approximately €25-40k (depending how my year finishes) less than the average of my last two years. The overall attainment figures for sales people are in the toilet. This will not be made clear during your interview and will not be openly discussed with management as to what a realistic quota should be. This ultimately has created a toxic environment where people feel undervalued due to their inability to hit an unrealistic target. In theory, everyone can make good money. In reality 90% of people will miss their target and the majority of commissions will be left in the hands of the few. The increasing product offering of Salesforce brings problems in terms of collaboration. It is not always easy to find the right person for the right meeting in good time. This can make it difficult for customers to do business with us, as the sales process can become protracted. While career options are varied, the criteria for promotion isn't ever clear. It is often a case of 10 people interviewing not knowing how many roles will be filled, not knowing when they will find out and unclear feedback as to why they did/didn't get the role. Naturally this has caused people to question the process.",9 people found this review helpful

Overall it's impossible not to say this is a great working experience, even if it ends up being a valuable chapter in a larger career.","The base salary is relatively poor although the ability to make commission can be massive. With that said, it comes down to the companies you're working with and there are plenty of very talented people at Salesforce doing poorly for this reason. The inverse applies as well - although the overall people standard is high there are some with mediocre talent and effort who stumble blindly into huge paydays.

Inspiring people and vision and a strong desire to try and do right by the customer. Also deliver amazing events globally.",Very sales focused and growth targets are very aggressive. Career opportunities are surprisingly limited and very talented people can get stuck in roles for years as the structure is so flat in marketing and the team is so lean that there’s often nowhere to go. Management is also very hit and miss. Some are great and others are incompetent. This inconsistency means that those under good managers do well and those under bad managers get stuck. The company needs to invest more in training people to be leaders and coaches rather than just putting them in charge due to tenure. Workload can be extremely high and overwhelming so it takes a while to work out how to get by without burning out. Also tend to employ highly experienced people to do a lot of execution as headcount is so limited they need to hire people who can create a strategy and execute it. This leads to frustration among people who could be doing so much more but get stuck in the detail of delivery.,14 people found this review helpful

300,53,Not a good place to work. Unequal territories,,1.0,"Good benefits, Free snacks","I was with Salesforce for a year. When I started I was made a lot of promises regarding the territories being fair within the team. However, once I got my territory and saw how it was compared to other territories across the team, I realized that 80% of the territories in any given team are bad. Only 20% of the accounts/territories are good and in which the sales people make money. And Management knows this. So if you are an Account Executive aligned well with Management, you are set. However, if you are like the 80% of the account executives, your fate is NOT in your hands as you will get bad accounts. They know this. The management's objective at least in the Toronto office is to only have 20% of the people make their #. They dont want anyone to be 200% of their #. They expect 80% of the reps to miss their #. The territories are extremely disparate. There's a lot of partiality in who gets what accounts. Be very careful when you join as an AE. For other roles like Marketing, Ops etc I've heard its a good place to work. However, for Sales its just like any other company. Dont fall for their lies when they tell you that the territories are fair. To give you a specific example, in the Toronto office there is one person who has 10 president's clubs. He makes a lot of money and his manager and his manager's manager are as expected totally aligned. He is a good rep. However, so are others on the team. However since he has always had the best territory the makes club every single year. Its ridiculous. If you've been in sales for a while, and comes across an environment where ONE person has made club 10 times and every one else has made club 1-2 times in the last 10 years, what would you conclude. The territories are uneven. The management is inept. For example this is the first company that I've come across where the Sales Manager's quota is not aligned with the team. For example in a team of 10 sales reps which a quota of $1M each, the manager doesnt have a $10M quota. His/her quota is way less than that. So even if the team misses their #, the manager makes his/her #. I had never seen that in my sales career. So to get promoted to a manager's role, you need to be connected to the right people. Be very careful in joining this company. For Sales its not as advertised. For other roles it might be different.",22 people found this review helpful

Due to this, management is represented by some excellent managers and others who are not but have been good in leveraging the above. Salesforce as a family: you are expected to be enthusiastic, participate and promote all sort of social events they serve you.

The company is very much in growth mode, which makes for optimism and a sense of purpose.","The company is at something of a crossroads, wedded to some of the disadvantages of its start-up mentality: thinking can be short-term, with decisions accordingly myopic, and there is too great a value placed on the diving-catch.

They'll only do what they want to do and all your ideas will be given to others and they are projected as their ideas. Totally biased and even after multiple feedbacks with the proofs they do not want to accept. They will always tell, there's more to come in the future stay tuned. It's not about promotions or hike percentages. It's about ethics and integrity which the management will oversee always. Sometimes it's clearly evident and visible to everyone in the team that something wrong is happening and the local leadership in Hyderabad, never want to fix it. They just want to bypass it saying the (people who get support from management) trying to do something extra why don't you support him instead of giving feedback. Later, the people who actually want to work as a team and share some feedback with the managers will be targeted big time and will be treated as like slaves or even worst them, Support - Worst support that I have seen in the service industry. These guys never understand its a product based support, not a BPO. With Salesforce having three releases a year with all upgradations & patches, it will be difficult for a support person to keep up to date all the time. The worst way of calculation with regards to the headcount. They say they're hiring people but for a quarter 50 people for a backlog and burden of thousands of cases is not working. Outdated metrics are being used to calculate productivity and other year-end calculations. Employee Success or HR: Apart from very few members Zaira Banu & Rajesh I do not see others responding to the questions raised by the employees. I'm not biased towards the above two but however, their work speaks for themselves. Now coming to the recruitment, Salesforce always recommends the employees to refer people to the organisation, however, the recruitment or referral process is worst (there is no other least word for this). I have referred around 10 profiles to this organisation, all the profiles haven't been considered. They stay in the first or second stage for almost 2 to 3 months and then the status changes to No longer in consideration. When we try to contact the recruiter there will be no response. FYI, the above mentioned 10 profiles have been selected in other organisations for better positions and better packages. It's clearly evident on the floor that there is an agreement between the manager and the respective team member. The team member will refer people and the respective manager will select that profile. Once the team member gets the referral bonus it will be shared by the team member(who referred to the profile) and the manager who recruited.",17 people found this review helpful

Salesforce managers refer to equality as an important principle, but some individuals seem more equal than others.. Most sales do not attain their targets in Belgium and base salary is low.

Be careful when stories are told before you sign your contract about very high salaries in case of going above your target.

Worst office politics I've experienced - conflicting goals across teams created tension between managers which trickled down to staff.

One particular manager was notoriously difficult to work with and had a reputation for bullying, playing favouritism, and making most people feel uncomfortable by employing a management style of intimidation. Despite multiple HR violations against him for his aggressive behaviour, nothing was ever done to rectify it. You're not encouraged to work as a team, but instead, encouraged to develop ways of getting ahead of others through sometimes unethical means. Middle management will overlook any unethical, throwing-under-the-bus behaviours if it means you help them hit their numbers and make them look good. Nurtures a cutthroat environment of arrogance and greed.

373,126,Do not join the Salesforce Support or CSG team,"Sep 4, 2018 - CRM Support Success Agent Tier-2 in Hyderābād",3.0,- Great pay. - Excellent benefits.,"1. If you're hired as ""Success Agent Tier-2"" for CRM support then your Salesforce career is over because you'll be working in a specific skill group (Configuration, Usage or Email team) and do not get any chance to explore the real Salesforce CRM tool. 2. Management do not to monitor/plan their employees leaves(PTO's) properly which again makes very difficult to work with a huge backlog of cases. You can expect 25-30 cases per agent in AMER shift or 30-35 cases per agent in EMEA shift. NOTE: I have worked in Wipro (worst of all IT companies) so I am very well aware of overload/ extra amount of work. 3. They do not have enough ""Tier-3"" resource which makes your life miserable because as Tier-2, you'll be the only point of contact for the customer who has raised a case. If customer escalates the case or gives you DSAT due to the delay in resolution, then it won't affect Tier-3's performance. Management will simply blame you. 4. So many bugs/ Known issues in every major releases which will make you cry like hell as a support agent. 5. If you ask CSG management to hire more resources to reduce the back log, they'll simply say - ""No we cannot because we do not have enough budget"". 6. HR team sends out an employee survey link in each quarter but that doesn't make any change in your work life. 7. Also when it comes to ""Employee referral""(if your friends, relatives or siblings gets hired then you get $2000/each) program in Hyderabad is one of the most ""Corrupted"" program they've. I have seen 3 examples of corruption in referrals where managers referred their siblings who has really good terms with the ""hiring manager"". They all got selected and each manager earned easy $2000 + Family member (as a salesforce employee). So again if you're hired as Success agent Tier-2 then forget about referring anyone. 8. No way you will get Onsite chance. Strict policy. Also please do not dream of getting free passes/visit to Dreamforce event especially if you're in India. ()",39 people found this review helpful

Salesforce is a machine, you will be put in it, use you for everything your worth, and they will spit you out and move on to the next one. Most people would say that this is what sales is like, but no, Salesforce is a beast of its own when it comes to pushing people to their limit.

I was there for 3 Fiscal Years and had my territory reduced by 50% and my quota rise by 50% every year. The 3rd time my patch became too small to hit the high quota. Sales mgmt would rather have 10 reps make 60% than 6 reps make 100%. Work-Life balance is tough too. Pressure for growth is massive on RVPs so it rolls down hill.

404,157,Salesforce - A company where everyone wants everyone to succeed,"Jul 18, 2017 - Business Development Representative in Singapore",5.0,"Senior leader in HQ once said, many companies have an onboarding process that likens a rock tumbler. Salesforce's onboarding likens a car wash. Gentle and gets the same result. This has been my experience so far as a new hire. People around are always looking out for you to make sure you can cope. There's a level of trust and faith that you'll ramp up to be productive in the company. I'll list just a few reasons why Salesforce is the number one place to work. Culture- many of us would agree that it's challenging to explain what working in salesforce is like to those who are not inside, simply because it's rare to find a culture as unique as Salesforce'. When you're in the company, you get a sense of positivity day in and day out, everyone wants to get to know you as a person, it's not just work, it's the person behind the work. You will also feel that every single person in the company sincerely wants you to succeed. From the enablement team equipping you with tools and resources to succeed, to Employee Success (more commonly known outside as HR) taking care of your wellbeing, to your sales leaders leading from the front to win with you, the company's values of trust and growth resonates deeply in the employees. Salesforce is particular about who gets hired in the company. It's not so much of your competency (though it's important), as it is of your character and how you work with people. If you like to outsmart others and constantly seek personal glory, you're not going to have a good time. Leadership - I believe a huge part of the success culture in salesforce stems from the leadership team. Of course, salesforce hires great managers who can already lead and motivate team, but there's a proper coaching system which enables each employee to align with the direction of our leaders vision quickly, and also improve performance. Think professional athlete teams. Continuous training and learning - we get a ton of training and resources on industry trends, salesforce products, professional skills like giving effective feedback etc. There's a proper system in place for those who want to develop their competencies or gain more knowledge. Even staff who are here for many years benefit from the training and development programs. The fun 'stuff' - you get wellness reimbursements (some get gym memberships, some get supplements, you can use it for most physical activities). There're also many team activities and celebrations which makes work a whole lot more fun. We also have 7 days volunteering time off where you can do it with the team or on your own. Big shoutout to the team in Singapore for making Salesforce the number one place to work!",IT industry changes very fast and processes changes from time to time.

You can get your work done, but if you are used to select your own tools or if you come from a Microsoft dominated environment you better be prepared for this as the impact to your productivity may be big in the beginning. The biggest problem to me has been that the Senior Management is not always on a level that I would expect them to be.

Manager / company very appreciative of goals achieved / job done",Extremely busy role with veryoften not enough hours in the day to achieve the days goals. Late nights and weekend work sometimes required to complete a project but the salary and benefits outweigh this negative and the company is very appreciative.

425,178,The Foundation To Build A Great Career,"May 17, 2016 - Support Analyst (Marketing Cloud) in London, England",4.0,Great salary and benefits. Great opportunity to work with big name/global clients. Management is flexible with work/life balance. Definitely a place to build the foundation for a solid career within the business or elsewhere. Colleagues are helpful meaning support is available where required.,"The job itself can be quite repetitive and not that challenging at times and there seems to be little exposure to other teams, meaning it might be more difficult to develop and move around within the company. Training is very weak - Much of the job involves on-the-job learning. Marketing Cloud exists because SF bought out Exact Target. There seems to be a divide between Marketing Cloud and the rest of the business business, meaning less integration with other areas of the business, but this slowly seems to be aligning. Furthermore. the majority of the MC team are based in the US, which means working together often. Although, this isn't an issue, it feels as the UK team are in the US team's shadow.",Be the first to find this review helpful

Too much 'AE Enablement'...AE's are now Customer Success, Technical Support, Operations, Sales Engineers as instead of hiring resources, everyone wants to train AE's to do their job...not a good use of high paid employees and takes away from productivity and revenue driving activities. As AE's you are pretty much seen as a number and stat to 'stay in the box' without a lot of autonomy on how to spend your day.

It was already suspicious that half of the team got rehired at the same time, but it turned out that this team had generally an extremely high turnover. The job itself was absolutely not challenging as it was merely an entry-level position, but immediately after joining we got told that there is a hiring freeze for the next months.

I got yelled at by the manager in the most unprofessional way and learned that this was normal there in this team. Well, it's not normal and absolutely not acceptable at all! I can only warn everyone to join who hopes this position could be a good start with Salesforce. It's a dead-end street!

481,234,8 years in and I love this place,"Jun 17, 2015 - Regional Sales Manager in Toronto, ON",5.0,"This review will probably come off biased as I've spent the last 8 years at SF and have grown my career with the company. I also met my wife at SF and we now have a lovely 2 year old daughter so suffice to say the decision to work here has proved a good one personally as well as professionally. I started fresh out of university with no idea what CRM or cloud computing was in a biz dev role, progressed into sales and am now a sales manager. Here are the top reasons I love SF: - upward mobility: the company is growing 30% YoY and with growth comes opportunity. I've held 6 positions in 8 years working here. - people & culture: I'm humbled on a daily basis by the people I work with. SF employees are smart, ambitious, fun and tend to genuinely care about the communities we work in and the world around us. There are exceptions to every rule, of course, but by and large we're a hard-working, fun-loving, high-achieving group that is just as collaborative as we are competitive. - pay: money talks! Compensation and benefits are top notch. For those in sales, the base pay will seem low but in 8 years I've never made less than 30% more than my OTE (base + commission). - trust: the vast majority of the people I've reported to have instilled a lot of trust in me to get my job done without interfering or micro-managing my day-to-day.","Pace: SF moves fast. Change is constant. You need to be comfortable being uncomfortable. This is not for everyone. If you're looking to rest on your laurels in a comfy position, you need not apply. Fiscal Year: this is a petty gripe but a valid one. The SF fiscal year ends January 31st, which means Christmas/New Year timeframe is one of the our busiest times of year. Taking vacation in December/January is highly discouraged given it's the busy season, not ideal if you're accustomed to taking time off for the holidays. Cross-Functional Collaboration: compared with most companies I've seen, we do a great job of collaborating across departments/functions to get the job done. Some would say we're world class in this department, but as a SF veteran my expectations are high and I think we can do better. At times certain departments feel misaligned and for us to continue growing we need to move as one tightly aligned organization.",1 person found this review helpful

486,239,Heroku,"Jul 30, 2018 - Principal Member of Technical Staff",5.0,"Heroku has had its ups and downs over the last few years as it has become more integrated with the larger Salesforce org, but it still feels staffed by the best minds in the business, and I love the product that we make. Salesforce itself has all the pros and cons of a large org, complete with hawaiian culture kool-aid and large-org inertia, but on the whole it feels like Benioff puts his money where his mouth is on societal issues, in a way that few corporate titans do. They're generous when it comes to family and benefits and have a corporate culture of giving. Inside Heroku, we are still a little bit inside our purple-tinted bubble. On balance it feels like the engineers, junior to senior, are a standard deviation or two above the median. The problems we solve are difficult and satisfying. The business is large and the opportunity remains even larger. It feels miraculous that we operate a product at such crazy scale with so few people, and speaks to our expertise in building scalable, automated things.","These are more Heroku issues than Salesforce issues. We were (and still are) strapped for headcount over many years. This leads to serious team health issues and burnout. Exec is keenly aware of the issue and taking steps to fix it, but it should never have gotten this bad. At the moment, our product org is also sorely understaffed following turnover and departures, which means that many engineering teams don't have anyone to help them make sound product choices. We get by, but the product roles are critical, and the product managers we have are spread way too thin. As above, our exec team is aware of the problem and trying to hire as fast as they can. These are short- to medium-term issues. I believe they'll get worked out and we'll have smoother sailing in a few months. Longer term, my larger concern is complacency. I don't know if Heroku/Salesforce has the gumption to make the big bets to really grow our business and remain relevant for the next epoch. For the last decade we've made it drastically simpler to run compute workloads in the cloud, and it's built a large and successful business. With containerization catching on and tooling becoming more mature, we're being commoditized. I don't know that exec has the appetite to determine what the next ""git push heroku master"" is, and allocate enough resources to pursue it. That feels like an existential threat.",1 person found this review helpful

512,265,Never been treated with such disrespect,,2.0,"I loved the office in the tower. The verdant shrubbery, vibrant colour, frequent events and culinary freebies made it an eclectic space to work in. Unfortunately the 7 functioning floors were overcapacity by 200 people which made things a little tight and meant there was little space to eat and sometimes even work! The benefits are amazing. Loads of discounts, vitality health, company Amex and comprehensive expensing system. It really felt like a privilege to be there. The internal tools and external products are very robust. It seemed as though everyone was very tidy, intelligent and mostly friendly. The companies and teams are quite siloed though so it’s rare that you’d interact with many people. There are so many people that you rarely bump into the same person twice in the same week. there are apps and people for everything. The onboarding is quite slick if a little cultish. There’s a big emphasis on happiness and inclusion.","Unfortunately for a company claiming to have an keen eye on equality and trust, it lets a few things slip through the net: I was called aside following an evening out with colleagues whilst off campus. A department head had reported me after being open about my sexuality in a private conversation. I’m not sure why they felt that was necessary; I wasn’t given any specifics, only that it made them uncomfortable although they didn’t mention this during the conversation! Anyway a few days later I was summoned to HR and I was handed my notice. No warning. No chance to defend myself. It’s a pity because the pay was really good. The internal recruiter who hired me was lovely. The work didn’t seem challenging enough yet however and there was too much process and planning in my opinion. I guess you just have to be careful whom you confide in when you work at a big co. At least my new job allows me to bring my dog to work.",9 people found this review helpful

519,272,Amazing company depending what you are looking for in your Cv,"May 14, 2019 - Senior Account Executive in Madrid",3.0,"- Pretty good OTE for the region plus excellent benefits (retirement plan , health and life insurance, ticket restaurant, wellness reimbursement, car allowance, ESPP,... - Product suit is amazing (even better the vision and marketing salesforce creates around them) Salesforce is really smart expanding the portfolio with additional product that add value into the stack and allow AEs to position further value depending the industry you are focus on (Marketing , service , commerce , mulesoft ...) (B2B B2C) - Really smart guys supporting the daily operations and business. You will have all the support from different areas of the organisation. - 95 up to 100 sales guys in tech would pay to have the opportunity to work in the number 1 Saas company worldwide. Nice to have in your c - Salesforce gives you the chance to work on amazing projects you would have the chance being in a different company.","Some disadvantages are coming from the advantages indeed: - It’s really difficult to make good money. Target are increasing and OTE are reflected based on global plans , so it depends a lot on how lucky you are you will be able to reach your targets. - You will have to manage the relationship not just with your direct reporting, but wih different stakeholders who will have different interests. As an example, different AEs from different vertical products interested in selling into the same account, different RVPs to manage with. Alignment is one of the most important words in the company. Some days you will finalise your day thinking about how 90% of your calls were to manage talks with colleagues and not customers/ partners. - Depending on the area you are focus in, territory can be really big or small. This comes with the maturity of the product in the market. Per example , Core products AEs are really focus in small territories, however new products in the Org (Mulesoft, Commerce ,...) counts with small teams yet. These AEs are focus in strategic deals and normally cannot support all the opportunities properly. At the end, quotas are increasing because of new products in the portfolio , but you cannot have the same level of support like in mature ones. So I would say it depends how lucky you are with an specific account your co prime could make a big piece of the quota. - I don’t personally believe you have to be the best sales person in the world to sell in Salesforce. Marketing investment and resources are super huge, some customers buy the vision and what they see in events many times , plus there is plenty of really experienced partners in the region. I would say your results at the end of the year will depend 30% of your work and 70% how lucky you are with your territory , maturity of your account and the work of your co-primes - If you like the start uptype of experience , this is not a place where you will be comfortable for a long time (I must confess smaller regions like Iberia are closer to a start up type of company thought ) However, sometimes you will have the feeling you will spend more time reporting, reading Quips, covering different events, than thinking strategically how to gain relationships, trust and projects. - This company can help you win good money, but reducing your health due to stress and long time at work. Work life balance is challenging. There is not an ending point , you will have to be really good Managing this point to have everyone happy : you (and your health , your closer family (that will have to be open on you travelling and spending long hours at work, and the company) This point is being really important. Some people are leaving , or thinking about doing it, because of this last reason. Retaining employees is key for the company. Many important people use to leave (mostly coming from the acquisitions) because they don’t get use to the way the company operates. A lot of people are ex oracles, this can creates a local culture where not anyone might be confortable with.",10 people found this review helpful

There are tonnes of technology jobs on offer around Dublin but from speaking with friends in other companies - salesforce offer one of the best opportunities to grow your career and bank balance. Don't get me wrong - I have seen some people take on the role of SMB and within 6 months it's obvious that they just aren't a good fit for technology solution selling. I personally have had to work my behind off and thankfully this year I'll be getting promoted to MM and I really look forward to the challenge ahead of me. If your considering a job with salesforce ask yourself 1. Do I want to work for the worlds most innovative tech company? 2. Does it matter if management really encourage me to give back to the local community and do some rewarding charity work? (It's real and trust me - you'll be overwhelmed by how good it feels) 3. Is career development really that important? 4 Could i spend €5K per year educating myself? 5. Would I enjoy working for a company that has a work hard/ play hard buzz? If yes is the answer then I really don't know of a better gig than salesforce....

I view the Oracle effect on Salesforce through the following: 1) Middle Management -This is probably the worst part of Salesforce. These ""managers"" have been placed into these positions as the company grew too quickly. Salesforce will take Account Executives and place them into management positions without previous coaching/mentor experience -As a result, many (not all) of these managers will bastardize AEs. They are very quick to through AEs under the bus to save their image. -These managers have no skills at coaching, helping, or mentoring. -I have personally been involved in one-on-one meetings where I have experienced a manager insulting myself and my work. I have witnessed AEs quit after one-on-one meetings as their manager pushed them beyond limits. -I have also witnessed managers insult clients. If the client ""pushes a deal"" outside of the month it is forecasted, managers will become overly aggressive with the client to pull it back. Sometimes this tactic works, but it upsets the client and destroys future relationships. -Middle management will pick their favourite AEs and provide everything possible to ensure their success. 1.5, 2, 3x territories. Providing the best territories to their favourites. -I left Salesforce as my manager was insulting, rude, aggressive, upsetting to clients, and deceiving. They were not a coach, mentor, or visionary. 2) Territory Management -As stated in the Middle Management section, some AEs will get 1.5, 2, or 3x the territories -Management will tell you that each territory is cut evenly (laughable). So if an individual has 2x territories, they should have enough business to close 2x monthly quota -Even though these lucky AEs have double the territories, your monthly quota is equal to theirs -If these lucky individuals sell 50% of plan in each territory (making up 100%) and you hit 98% of your plan, middle management will act like these individuals are the next Glengarry Glen Ross. Middle Management won't even give you a pat on the back. -It is unfortunate to witness some individuals burn out quickly because they have to work 10x harder in a single territory as others have 2 or 3x territories with the same quota. 3) Transformation of the AE Role -When I first started, AEs were viewed as ""consultants"" with your clients. Your objective was to thoroughly work with your clients to uncover opportunities, manage the projects, and develop thorough business cases. Most importantly, we were to know our clients' business inside and out. -The AE role has now changed into a business development rep. -Middle management will have you call blitz your clients (which they clients get annoyed with), try to identify an opportunity, then pass it to a co-prime (Pardot, Data.com, Service Cloud, Desk). -The AE no longer works throughout the sales cycle. Management seeks to make the AE role into a transactional based environment -This is upsetting to anyone who enjoys relationship selling. -Many clients are becoming annoyed with the various AEs and Co-Primes continually connecting with them. 4) Quick Wins Now vs. Strategic Larger Deals -Management is so focused on monthly quotas that they will push AEs and clients into decisions before the sales cycle is complete -This could negate larger strategic deals as the client gets a ""band-aid"" fix.",27 people found this review helpful

Also, if you need to get anything done with the creative team, you'll be asked to support 1-5 new employees for their team, which costs more and delivers less than hiring an agency to help as needed. It's all about grabbing power there and it's ruining the culture, forcing great talent to leave, and short-changing real growth opportunities.

It maintained its culture even during the years of exponential growth (2009-12). The talent at this company is phenomenal. Opportunities to contribute and grow were great.,"A bunch of Oracle execs were hired over the last 3 years, and they have been busy replicating the Oracle culture here. The worst changes to the company have come in at the beginning of 2015. Quality Engineering was de-prioritized across the R&D organization. Many of the QE execs have been given different roles (I am not complaining about this. To be fair, many of these so-called QE execs should be fired. Do we really need 10 VPs in Quality Engineering? QE heads are now reporting to development managers. The road ahead points to converting all teams to Engineering teams. So if you are a QE trying to get a job, look elsewhere. Do not listen to the drivel from the recruiters. QE ROLE IS ENDING AT SALESFORCE! Added to this, the conflicting priorities are ever increasing in this company. R&D is at its 3rd attempt to re-write the UI, and make it adaptive at the same time. The so-called Salesforce 1 app was a disaster. The next attempt is starting in 2015.

739,20,G & A Positions are terrible,,1.0,"Salesforce has great benefits and they treat their sales, marketing and product development teams as well as any company could treat their employees. Very generous benefits package including great health insurance, company paid for vision insurance, a decent PTO policy, and much more.","Salesforce falls short in how they treat their G&A teams. Succeeding in G&A is not based on skills, qualifications, or ability. As a qualifier, I am not saying this out of spite for being passed over for a promotion or a raise, as I have not even tried for those opportunities yet, this is based on the observations I have of other people in the workforce. First issue, G&A treats those in the main offices much better than they do some of the smaller offices. There truly is a disparate treatment between those in main hubs and those in smaller offices. If you are not located in a main hub, regardless of if the position needs to be at one of the hubs, you have a nearly 0% chance of being given the same opportunities as those in the main hubs. They will not look at what you have accomplished nor will they recognize the value you provide to the company. They will promote from the main hubs or place people in positions that are in the main hubs without even considering other employees across the country. The other key to being given opportunities in the G&A functions is to campaign for the position. Even if you are not the most qualified, if you can make people think you are, Salesforce G&A leadership will not even do interviews to determine who is best for the job. They will wave their little magical wand and poof, the person who has less skills and abilities, but who knew who to align themselves with and convince they are better than everyone else will get moved into positions of authority. If you are a person who does not mind being dishonest, immoral, and you are willing to put down and crush those around you, apply for a G&A function in one of the main Salesforce offices around the country, you will move up quickly and never have to worry about actually knowing your stuff before you are promoted. You may not even need to wait for a position to open up, they may just create a brand new position for you. If you are a great worker who does not like to step all over other people to move up or if you are not in one of the main offices this is not the place for you. They will not even listen to your qualifications skills or abilities when positions open up.",11 people found this review helpful

This leads to a lot of hard to trace bugs. -A lot of PM here are super junior who have no clue what's the product development is. This leads to product decision delay, etc. Product planning is totally a joke here. No Scrum of any sort, the process puts a lot of weight on engineer to figure out the problems and solutions. The only thing the PM really does here is to send out email releases when something is about to release. -Lots of young engineers who only care about deliver cool features fast which sacrifices the quality. If you happen to work on a feature last, you are the single point of contact and have to maintain the whole load of it. -Watch out for all the good perks, at some points, when SalesforceIQ is fully melted into Salesforce family, these perks will also go away. Take a look at the Fraiche account, the Lyft credit, the housing stipend, they are all gone. -Don't let the offer congratz email blast from the recruiting and engineering team cloud your judgement. All the things about the family like culture and what's not, this culture is no longer respected. -Some middle managers are control freaks who like to micro manage every of you move. -Every Friday demo is just a hacky thing that squeezes out your extra work and you feel obligated to demo something to the company. -The quarterly Hackday mentality is just another way you work extra hard and late night to produce something really cool.",7 people found this review helpful

It saddens me that even a below-21 intern feels he/she can't participate fully in the ""culture"" because drinking is such a ""big part"" of it, as seen in a recent Glassdoor review. I don't drink for health reasons, and I often feel like work events (holiday parties, team celebrations, Dreamforce) are less rewarding for me because the non-alcoholic choices are an afterthought. Can I have a $20 gift card instead?! I've seen a lot of employees misbehaving and embarrass themselves through alcohol. Time to cut back. Alcohol is not the same thing as a company culture. Second, I have no illusions that working remotely is a perfect situation. I know I miss out on a lot in the office and I am ok with it. That said, I think the company could do more to make Salesforce better for non-SF members of the Ohana. I also think there should be better career paths for those who are not managers. Because I'm remote, I have been told I don't have much room to move up since I can't manage remotely (even though my manager manages me remotely... and that seems to work fine).

Our group has become more fragmented and less collaborative. There's more fear of making mistakes and the general sense of trust and support for our work from our leadership has gone way down. The transparency and access we had upwards is becoming more hazy largely because of layers being added. My autonomy and empowerment to make decisions is slipping away. Politics were always there, but now they're something you have to consider daily. You used to be judged based on the work you created and what you shipped, it doesn't feel that way anymore.

888,169,Acquisition has been rough on veteran SteelBrickers,,3.0,"The foundation of why SteelBrick was a great place to work still exists in small amounts; great employees, caring and friendly environment, opportunities to move your career forward, etc. - Salesforce has brought on some nice benefits like Volunteer Time Off (VTO), and access to more resources about the SFDC ecosystem that we already lived in as a separate company. So it's been great for employees who were already passionate about this space. -Working at Salesforce now has opened doors to try out new roles in other teams and transfer internally. -Non-sales SteelBrick employees work out of a nice building in SF with great perks; free catered lunches, on-site gym, yoga classes, meditation, etc. Sales team works out of HQ SF office and enjoys being closer to core AE's.","- The Salesforce acquisition changed a lot of things about the culture, positions, teams, and leadership of SteelBrick for the worse (as expected with any acquisition, but still tough to manage). - The acquisition happened so fast (announcement to close ~1 month), that it barely gave employees time to process. The business had to be wrapped up and packaged for SFDC so quickly that employees were basically handed their offer letters and told 'sign now and we'll figure out logistics about how your position will change later'. -The lack of communication during the acquisition, on boarding, and transition process created a divide between leadership and employees, causing distrust in leadership. Employees were commonly given answers about the future of their positions with 'we're not sure yet, we're working on it, and we'll let you know when we figure things out'. - SteelBrick leadership focused primarily on their money-making teams (sales and dev) as their priority to ensure a smooth transition. The other teams we're offered positions with Salesforce, but haven't been given the opportunity to get the same improvements. The leadership team is only willing to fight for the teams that make more money for them. - The further we get into Salesforce, the more we've lost our personal identity and culture. There's not as many fun events or opportunities for employees to come together and enjoy some time off. Everyone's too overworked and underpaid to want to stay around the office longer then they have to.",7 people found this review helpful

There were also so many fun events to help interns explore San Francisco such as a cable car tour, a small cruise ride, or street food tours. Overall Company: The company culture is fantastic. Salesforce is huge on doing social good and do a lot to help employees have a positive impact as well. For example, there is generous donation matching, hours of VTO (time off for volunteering,) and awards for employees who volunteer more. For example, the company has an internal Facebook-like system where posts are public to everyone and most communication / business is done on it. Every 4 months, there's an internal career fair where you can learn about other teams' projects and transfer to another team if you'd like.","It's a larger company so work tends to move more slowly.

900,181,Like sipping water out of a firehose,,4.0,"Hands down the best product in the market when it comes to Q2C. It's easy enough that even folks without any background in technology can competently set-up and maintain the application. While most competitors need to bastardize their application to ""make it work"", SteelBrick is all about out-of-the-box functionality which makes it a breeze. The market is hot to trot as well. Analysts indicate that Q2C is a massive, multi-billion dollar market by 2019 and even though we have 2x more customers than anybody in the space, we're only scratching the surface. The leadership team at SteelBrick knows everybody by name and works to build meaningful relationships - which goes a long way. Wellness plan covers up to $100 a month and working for Salesforce comes with a BUNCH of employee perks. Offices are moving downtown (and out of the suburbs) which I'm personally excited about.","Before the Salesforce acquisition, SteelBrick was growing at an explosive pace. Since the acquisition, explosive growth is an understatement. With that said, everybody is running at breakneck speed and I think that (as a team) we're a bit worn down. If you join SteelBrick, be prepared to be pulled in a million directions all at once. Work / life balance is out of sorts. Right now (8/22/16), the CORE Salesforce team doesn't have much education on Q2C or understanding of product fit. This means we're talking with a lot of customers that are poor fit or having to field angry calls about why we ""killed"" a poorly qualified opportunity. I don't foresee this problem going away any time soon since Q2C is the most complex product offering in Salesforce's portfolio. There are a limited amount of SteelBrick-certified partners (~50), but customers insist on working with partners that have no experience implementing Q2C applications. This means that their implementations are taking longer than they should. There's nothing we can do about this since it's ultimately the customer's choice, but it puts unnecessary burden on our team. Customers come back during their implementation asking for support, but what they really want is implementation guidance. There is a lot of process change happening right now. For current employees, it's been pretty frustrating. I don't know if this has any barring on new hires, but it does make it difficult to get straight answers since we're all new to these processes as well.",3 people found this review helpful

The FutureForce team does an amazing job filling the summer with fun experiences (party on a boat, renting out all of SOMA Streatfood Park, a baseball game, and so much more) as well as learning experiences. We had lunch and learns from executives like the CFO, CEO of Heroku, and tons of thought leaders. What's really great about all of these experiences though is that it's clear the fun and learning is not just an opportunity for interns but for full time employees too. Throughout the summer, there was an all Tech and Product summer picnic at the zoo with included animal adventures and an amazing barbecue, a Summer of 99 party, and tons of lunch and learns with internal and external people presenting research. On my team I was able to contribute to features and bugs and was challenged and stretched but supported the whole time. I was able to demo to high level executives and definitely contribute real value. Another really unique aspect of Salesforce is their commitment to Ohana, or family. All of the employees, customers, and partners are treated with the highest level of respect. I especially appreciated the commitment to increasing diversity in the tech industry. One way Salesforce aims to do this is through the employee resource groups, like FemmeForce, BOLD, OutForce, and LatinoForce. Another way Salesforce aims to help the community is through volunteering. Every employee gets 56 hours to volunteer and we as interns were able to spend up to 56 hours volunteering as well!

924,205,"If your company is getting acquired by Salesforce, be careful",,2.0,"- 5 months after my company was acquired by Salesforce, I was ultimately transferred to a manager who was very kind and understanding. Despite having my team thrown upon him, he tried the best that he could without knowing anything about us. He did not micro-manage and I thoroughly enjoyed working for him. I appreciated everything he did for me, but ultimately, he did not have enough power to change the situation. - I loved the people I worked with at my original acquired company and still got to work with them closely after the acquisition. - Good snacks and wellness benefits.","- If you come from an acquisition, Salesforce isn’t going to pay you as well as they pay their internal employees. Even if you are doing the same exact job as someone inside Salesforce, you will probably be making significantly less than what a core employee will be making. It was extremely frustrating and completely demeaning to hear all the hype and news about how Salesforce employees are so happy with their compensation and how Salesforce is making strides towards equal pay. Apparently, acquired company employees are not part of that equation and we do not hold as much value and shouldn’t be treated as equals…ridiculous. I asked for a compensation change in order to match or even come close to the pay of my peers within the Salesforce organization but was told that Salesforce does not have enough internal data to justify a compensation change. Essentially, there was no proof at Salesforce that I was worth a compensation change. This blew my mind because when you first hire someone, you have no proof internally that they are worth the salary that you are going to pay them. What you do instead is evaluate their past experiences and then you determine what is fair pay based on their experiences, skills, and the job that they are doing. You have no internal data or proof in that situation. If you acquire a company, yes, you have no Salesforce data to prove that an employee is worth a certain salary but you acquired a product that you clearly thought had value and the people who helped to create that product are not worth a compensation change because you don't have enough data? I had been working for the acquired company for almost a year, but all of that was meaningless because if you're acquired, it seems like you're not truly a ""Salesforce employee"" and being paid fairly is not something that applies to you. - Our entire acquisition process was a complete mess. My team and I essentially had to operate “as normal” which was completely impossible given that all of our management and the rest of the company were trying to figure out the acquisition themselves. We were lost in the transition, did not have managers for quite some time, and were essentially left to fend for ourselves for the better part of 4 months. It didn’t seem like the M&A team knew what to do with us and had forgotten we existed. - During the acquisition process, we were told that there would be tons of opportunities within the Salesforce organization but once we were in the Salesforce organization, in reality, there were no opportunities. We contacted departments and teams we were interested in and were repeatedly told that they were not hiring or that you needed XYZ experiences that none of us had. We had no choice in what department or role we were assigned. A role was thrown on us, whether we liked it or not, with no other presented opportunities. - My team and I were expected to hit ridiculous numbers as soon as we were acquired despite the fact that we were not fully integrated, did not receive the goal numbers until halfway through a quarter, and still had to facilitate the entire merging of all our systems with Salesforce's systems. We received very little support from the core Salesforce organization and were treated as if we were incompetent because we could not hit these numbers. It seemed like my team and I were being set up for failure so that the core team had a reason to get rid of us once we did not hit a specific goal.",32 people found this review helpful

933,214,Insane Growth,"Jul 25, 2016 - Software Engineer",4.0,"The insane growth in Pardot is pretty incredible. The company provides inside details on revenue specifics which gives you confidence in its decision. Despite hiring so many people, they still invest quite a bit of the budget into its employees. Did someone say perks? Yeah, they're still there and even better than before.","The growth has made Pardot lose that tight culture it once had. Previously, everyone would say ""hi"" to everyone and make a chance to learn everyone's names. Now, there's a ridiculous amount of people and cliques have formed. You can't really fault the company for this, that's on the employees. From an engineering perspective, Pardot is inherently stuck on this giant monolithic legacy code base. When you hire 5 new engineers each week, there are the same exact questions because no one can even google the answer given how old the majority of the tech stack is. There have been efforts to split this out into micro services but decisions are often made by engineering managers and tech leads who have been dispositioned into enterprise related solutions that are often dated for the modern web and just not fun to work with. You can't blame them too much for this, product managers are breathing down their necks constantly. More often than not, these early decisions aren't well thought out and lead to projects getting scrapped 6 months later or resulting in a significant re-design. Annoyingly too that is that Pardot has a concept of ""hack days"" to work on whatever you want. This used to be an engineering fun event and solutions that made a better coding experience would often win. Since the T&P (Technology and Product) lingo started evolving, the only thing that wins is something that can sell something.",1 person found this review helpful

I provided a lot of feedback on how to improve processes and promote collaborative culture as other coworkers were feeling similarly, but nothing was done. At Salesforce, I completely feel as if I'm heard by management. I've transferred to several different teams with ease (in fact, after one year at the company they encourage it and create programs to shadow other roles). My managers are genuinely interested in progressing my career and enabling me to succeed and I've enjoyed working with all the teams I've been on. I've had a lot of flexibility to ensure I still have a nice work/life balance and that I actually get to use all the perks available!

I am a firm believer in giving back which is why volunteerism was an important criteria for me when seeking out employees.

1047,14,Depends on your department,,3.0,"Salesforce, as a whole, is by far the best company I could wish to work for. It was my dream company to work for, mainly because of the culture. Beyond the in-house perks, there’s the 56 hours a year we are given to volunteer and give back in pretty much anyway you see fit. The benefits are superior to any company I’ve worked for. The buildings are a pleasure to work in each day. They focus on wellness and striking a good work-life balance. And in all earnesty, want to, and do give back to our communities.","Unfortunately, all of the above is not available across the board. My manager has, short of explicitly saying it, told us we can only volunteer 15 hours a year, to create only one career development goal, “he doesn’t care what it is”, rolls his eyes at the thought of us taking advantage of the company’s championed cause of meditation, told us we aren’t allowed to take ANY time off for a six month period every single year. And to top it off, he’s the biggest micromanager I have ever worked for in my career. You better be the first one there, and last to leave, finishing work at home doesn’t “count”. And not once, has he ever complimented or commended any of us. Doctor appointment? Have a family commitment during the week? Better not make a habit of it. God forbid you have something going on that requires frequent doctor visits. If we want to grow our skill sets via Trailhead, better do it after hours or on the weekend. Mind you, I talk to other people in the company and they are appalled that this is happening. My ratings are based on my specific experience, and do not represent the typical Salesforce experience. I thought it was just him, and some of it certainly is, but the whole department is toxic. There’s turnover left and right, every couple of weeks it seems another coworker chooses to leave the company. And if the VP cared, they would do something. It’s blatant. I have thought of raising the issue to HR but it’s obvious these people have been here a long time, and make someone above them happy, so it’s pointless.",23 people found this review helpful

On top of that, I was putting in 11-12 hour work days (which is encouraged, might I add) and only making 3% commission on every deal I closed even though I grew my little territory over 80%. You make no money here, you are not compensated fairly and when brought up to management they sweep it under the rug and deflect.

Ongoing trailheads and updates also keep you on your toes. - Fast-paced environment - Great culture - Talented professionals - Collaborative environment across different segments - Brand recognition - Smooth employee processes in the background (payroll, time logged, benefit tracking, incentive tracking, employee profile, etc). - Continuous acquisitions of companies continues to strengthen our products and offerings. - Snacks, events, and happy hours - Flexibility and autonomy given to consult with your clients - Networking opportunities here are endless","- You can feel ""left-behind"" here at times, so it's crucial to stay organized to keep up with the pace, especially early on. - Work-life balance (self-induced): it's easy to become attached to your work and your accounts, and it trickle over into your personal life after hours, or on weekends. - Difficult quota to hit, but that's for a reason. if this were easy I suppose they would let anyone in.

The company did away with formal performance reviews a few years ago. There is a culture of praise here, so constructive feedback is rarely given - Roles and teams are incredibly silo'd now. This is not the place to be if you're looking to grow and develop your career in a multitude of different ways - Easy to get lost in the sea of things: the company has grown way too large in recent years - Growth and progression are slow. Career development is non-existent if you remain in your current position. Since there are so many employees now, each job that an employee has is incredibly specific, so if you want a change of pace, you'd have to change out of your role entirely Also, for what it's worth, I strongly believe that Salesforce actively reaches out to news outlets and pays to get on those ""Best Employer"" lists that come out yearly.

1324,291,Hybrid Engineering is causing chaos,,3.0,Great company culture. Good work life balance. Smart developers with good problem solving skills. Great career growth opportunities. Planning of work is better than most other companies that I have come across.,"Hybrid Engineering has pros and cons. However, in Indy, the strategy for hybrid transition is causing a significant loss in engineering productivity. First, Pros: 1.) Hybrid engineering has brought more focus on using contemporary tools for automated testing. 2.) This helps in improving system reliability and make developers better at their jobs since testing is not considered an afterthought anymore. 3.) Huge investment in automated testing upfront is a good overall strategy that will help in system scalability and reduce buggy software releases. Cons: 1.) The idea for depending more on automated testing than on manual testing has translated into demanding all manual / semi manual qa testers to learn how to code. 2.) This is the strategy that has not panned out at all. While, the self help tools like online courses, mentoring resources and in-team guidance have been a proactive ongoing effort, this approach is taking massive hits on productivity for developers as well as for testers all around. 3.) You can find developers on any given day spending quite a bit of time (hours at times) going over basic step by step process (over and over again) with the testers to resolve minority non-mission critical bugs. 4.) Testers, especially who are not from a programming background / havent coded in a while, are overwhelmed and stressed out about the tickets they have to complete each sprint. 5.) For a company that champions engineering productivity and no interruption time for developers, developers are spending less time on quality features/innovative/disruptive work and more time getting bogged down by the process+manual testing+ incremental work . Dont get me wrong, the notion of ohana is embedded deep in the organization and engineers are glad to help their peers anytime. However, this is a massive hit on productivity.",9 people found this review helpful

1486,153,"5 stars company and opportunity for the ones ready to go the extra mile, everyday.",,5.0,"Excellent colleagues and extended team with brilliant people among the organization that will continuously teach you one or two things you didn't know. Full freedom, ownership, and responsibility of your deals and clients. You have the last word regarding stuff related to the sales process and your voice will also be listened and respected in any other area or topic. Amazing structure and processes. Everything is thought and in continuous progress so there is always something or someone ready to give you answers or help you out. Huge incentive package with repetitive SPIFFs and bonuses that can rocket jump your final compensation and motivation. If you mix it with all the benefits and perks Salesforce provides, you can really simply focus on working. Feeling of family, understanding, and respect since day one. Values of Ohanna and Equality are not just a commercial label but something that's put in practice every day. ""Limitless"" career progression. New positions, clouds, acquisitions, and markets are coming up in a really fast pace manner so you can visualize your future next step within the company in a very early stage.","Information overload. Having an already impressive world of solutions, with new updates, apps, integrations, or products coming up every month, is almost impossible to stay on track about all you should know. The resources are limitless and helpful but you can get lost in a huge ocean of data that can lead to a little bit of desperation. Easy to fall in an only work mindset life, and it will be your fault, not the company's. Moving into Dublin (not the most exciting and cheap city in the world) for a job will already tell enough about you. This is a demanding job with a lot of freedom and perks from the company (the company and the management are the number 1 rest, holiday and work/life balance importance praisers) but if you want to do a good job and perform as you are coming here to, expect to work very long hours and days, especially in the beginning. Don't expect to be a free bird as you used to be, probably never. Targets are ambitious and so is your compensation and benefits, so expect to be tied tight and monitored on a very regular basis. With the working from home, it has been more accentuated that some might confuse it with micromanagement. Never is enough. Like any other sales company in the world, no matter how much you sell or work, you can always be asked to do little more. Take ownership of your pipeline and expect not to get the foot out of the gas pedal until the holidays break, no matter at which number you at. The party is almost over. If you are coming from an startup, you should see Salesforce as that older brother that used to be in all of the parties getting into its mid 30's. He knows what the fun is about but is now switching into a more responsible lifestyle and will only join those parties once a month let's say.",5 people found this review helpful

1508,175,Obsolete Management and Working Style.,"Sep 4, 2020 - Senior Associate in Tokyo",1.0,"Benefits such as wellness allowance, great office location (centre of Tokyo).","JP office is extremely domestic, and does not have the drive, momentum or speed which other international tech firms or a typical foreign sub company has as a working culture. Since the majority of the people in the back office has been working here for a very long time (which is a good thing in one way), many of them are not use to changes - rather prefer to stick to the norm. Ohana is one of the key culture (which is a great conceptually) in Salesforce. But in JP back office, this is recognized in a different/miss leading manner. More specifically, it's been recognized as ""protection"", rather than supporting and challenging each other for growth. This shows up as lack of ownership, professionalism and extremely conservative working style/attitude. If you try to challenge someone, you're taken in a different way. Since there's really no culture of challenging each other, it's taken very offensively --- that's still fine but the most shocking part is, senior management doesn't notice or understand anymore of the benefits of growth via challenges and constructive communication. This is one of the most disappointing aspects of this office where it doesn't show to the outer world --- I have seen another review saying ""a master of disguise"" and completely understand what it means. When joining, do not expect a high paced, competitive working style lead by professionals with strong ownership --- but rather expect a conservative environment, hence for those who are looking for growth via challenges, constructive communication and data driven decision makings, this may not be the best place for you. Money is good, but growth wise, not able to recommend.",5 people found this review helpful

You'll be assigned an install base which is where most reps get their ACV from (this is why Salesforce acquires so much tech so they can keep customers within their ecosystem and sell them new products). If you don't have an install that is ready to buy this will impact your overall performance. Flips and inbounds will also play a big factor, depending which market you're in will ultimately determine your end results. Anyone outside of Sydney or Melbourne good luck!

You don't feel trusted. - Unrealistic workloads. - Encouraged to manage your work life balance but chastised if you actually do it. I've been scolded for having my car serviced at 2pm, or taking annual leave at a quarter cut off to celebrate a birthday. - Meetings for meetings sake burning precious time. - Saturated account sets. Prospects get bombarded continually from all angles of Salesforce and have been for over a decade. - Lead generation is down to you. You have to be BDR, AE and even SE on some opportunities, unless you're in the enterprise/strategic accounts. I have not had more than 3 leads passed to me in almost 18 months. - Always an ""urgent"" action that needs to be taken.

Presentation, communication, demonstration, and soft skills are also needed for this role.","Sometimes you feel like you are on your own, and have to figure things out.

(Note that it wasn't all rosy, Salesforce also chose to do a round of layoffs during the pandemic, even though they were experiencing a record quarter, which caused a lot of controversy.) For as large of a company as Salesforce is, it is reasonably transparent. Employees have access to executive leadership, and have opportunities to ask them tough questions, such as regarding the layoffs they chose to do during the pandemic.","There is a lot of pride in Salesforce's culture, which can often feel a bit cult-like. I joined Salesforce through an acquisition, and the leaders at the acquired company seemed much more used to tough questions than leaders that I observed at Salesforce.

I had looked to move into another role for a while, but, as a director level, there weren't a lot of opportunities - Salesforce is hiring more and more junior people to fill roles. My position was eliminated and replaced by an analyst level person straight out of college. Many other higher level ( read- older, long-term employees) folks were part of the same layoff in 2020. You will have many different managers while you are there - I had 13 in 8 1/2 years. So, if you have a bad one, wait - they will move into something else. The bad part of this is its hard to make a mark when you constantly have to re-prove yourself. The company used to give raises every year - even just a cost of living raise.

The opportunity to work on different tech stacks is great. The people in Security Assurance are highly dedicated and live the value of Trust.

Without a clear vision and direction, the focus is on fire fighting and operational day-to-day tasks. The culture never recovered from the DefCon/Meat Pistol incident and leadership turnover.

1946,85,It's a mirage - Do you research,,2.0,Similar to other reviews pros. You can find their benefits packages online. The company acquires new business almost semi-annually so you can potentially move around. Benefits/Perks/ESPP Some amazing coworkers Pretty good c-suite/ Amazing middle line managers Great managing Covid - Listened to the employee feedback for the most part,"There are reviews here with 0 cons which I find hard to believe for a 60K employee company. They jam public surveys down our throats to get the image of the ""Best place to work."" Seems like HR is rushing to drown out poor reviews.... Salesforce is an okay place with some very, very toxic people. I've met one of the worst human beings of my life here, and with how the world is in 2021, that's saying a lot. First-line leaders are more often bad than good. Back office draws territories randomly every year, and leaders have very little say, so it's the luck of the draw. Under 20% of reps hit quota and meet their OTE for a company already underpaying due to their name. You need to hit quota to get paid a reasonable amount which only happens once maybe twice a year if you're lucky. Managers won't acknowledge that you have a bad territory and have the same expectations as the leading rep. Leading rep makes 3 to 4 times the amount of everyone else and is put on a pedestal but everyone including themselves knows it's the opportunity given. Accounts change every year, so prospecting is demotivating, knowing the work you do will go to someone else. Essentially an order taker with not enough orders to hit quota. Very saturated market. Inundated with pointless nonrevenue generating admin work/meetings. Inundated is an understatement. The majority of the information logged within the CRM is fake due to the pressure to meet all of the initiatives and stay off the naughty list. Leading to inaccurate reporting which leads to increased expectations. You will be drowning, gasping for air as your first-line leaders stand on your shoulders with their heads out of the water... for the most part. If you can tread water for 2+ years, you will get the Salesforce stamp of approval on your resume to find a better, higher-paying job. 2-3 year turnover is drastic. HARD WORK DOES NOT GET YOU AHEAD. Your mental health and wellbeing will deteriorate. Please do your research and reach out to folks working there to get their opinions.",13 people found this review helpful

Tons of enablement and assets to leverage in selling, however a lot of the materials live in disparate locations making it tough to navigate. You work with a huge extended Salesforce army, many of which are specialists on a specific product so you’re not expected to be an expert on all solutions which is nearly impossible considering the amount of products you have to sell. You will learn so much here about the art of selling, they truly do produce some of the best sales talent. ESPP is nice, but so is equity which as a sales person you don’t get because they think your commission is enough but the reality is if you’re not meeting your monthly goals then you’re not reaping any of that “benefit”. Monthly wellness stipend is nice and so is the name recognition you'd get on a resume.","1) When starting out they will give you the worst patch to see if you can turn dry lemons into lemonade. As you get more tenured you may or may not receive a better patch, it depends on how you want to navigate the favoritism game. The more popular you are with leadership, the better the accounts and the more flips you will get. 2) To be successful it's all about the 3 T's: Territory, Timing, and Talent in exactly that order. If your accounts aren't growing, you will have a very difficult year ahead living on base salary alone which is already way lower than market. Be prepared to spin your wheels which can often feel like high effort low return as CRM decisions don't happen overnight. 3) Every start of the fiscal accounts are shifted around which can be frustrating both internally and externally. The revolving door of AEs makes it hard to establish long term trust with customers. 4) Be prepared to invest a lot of time fixing CSAT issues from poor implementation left behind from the rep before you. 5) The majority of ACV is made in Q4 which is around year-end holidays, making it stressful to take time off.",2 people found this review helpful

They don't utilize their BDRs correctly and believe were supposed to research all of their new logo accounts and come in with a step by step plan. How am I supposed to do this with no knowledge or direction on any of the products or goals?

During the pandemic more work was given than less. Getting a promotion requires you to push numbers rather than do work that benefits the team. All of the number fibbers and cherry pickers are the ones getting the back rubs here. Work/life balance is not respected all that much. It's stated that you should strive for a work/life balance, but the amount of work given does not allow it, and you'll usually find yourself frantically looking for extra time to fulfill work that's been unrealistically dumped on you. KPIs are unrealistic given the extension of some issues that customers raise. Upper management makes quick uneducated changes that usually goes against what everyone in the org would recommend, but they do it anyways.",7 people found this review helpful

The company has shown its true colors during the covid pandemic. Impossible quotas as is with no quota relief during pandemic. BDRs are measured by how much Monopoly money they put into Salesforce and how buddy buddy they are with their AEs. The company says one thing to the press but treats its employees a completely different way. I have not felt any instance of “Ohana” since being here even though I was super excited to work for Salesforce. BDRs feel as if it’s them against the world at this company and have to deal with AE ego on a consistent basis.,4 people found this review helpful

2149,26,Toxic and flawed work environment in sales recruiting (and recruiting in general),,1.0,Great company to have on your resume Learn how to balance a high volume workload Overtime pay,"During my time here, I've witnessed countless examples of discrimination and inappropriate comments from management, specifically my manager. This behavior is accepted. Salesforce is not a company that welcomes open, honest dialogue and feedback. If you disagree with management in any way, expect retaliation. There are people in management positions who have no business being there. When you have questionable leadership, it causes many issues and problems that go unnoticed. In my case, I was subjected to report to someone who lacks the basic qualities a good manager must have: empathy, understanding, active listening, patience, strong communication, transparency, and loyalty to your team. Don't expect any of those qualities in many of the managers at Salesforce. The managers here continue to ""kick down and kiss up"" to get to where they are today. My manager lacked maturity, basic professionalism, and self-awareness . He has said some derogatory things about women, made incredibly inappropriate comments on team calls, and speaks to some of the females on his team in such a brash, disrespectful manner. It did not help that the person he reported to, the next manager in the line of management, was inherently cold and disconnected. I have never seen such self-serving managers in my professional career. The recruiting managers and leaders will never have your back. Example: If a candidate feels as though he/she should have gotten a job they interviewed for and chooses to retaliate against the recruiter ( example: write a bad Glassdoor review and name you), recruiting leadership will reach to place blame on the recruiter. Bad Glassdoor review = bad for the brand and the ""brand"" is #1 priority at Salesforce. EVERYTHING that is done at this company is done as an effort to strengthen their brand. It's all for show. All they care about is being perceived as ""a company that cares"" with an ""Ohana"" culture, when in reality, it is all about optics and concealing an incredibly abusive, toxic culture. Be prepared to also have a manager that takes credit for your success. You did well because they ""set you up for it"" and ""coached you."" (During my entire time there, I have never learned anything valuable from my first line manager - with the exception of what kind of manager I will not be one day) Recruiting here is a factory. It's all about pumping out hires quarter after quarter and hitting an arbitrary hiring number at any expense, even if you have to bend the rules a bit. Example: having people have start dates when they're still employed at their current employer, pressuring sales candidates to start immediately without giving a notice period to their current employers and using manipulative tactics like saying ""If they really want this job, they will make it happen""...etc. Salesforce hires most - if not all - recruiters on contract first. They reassure you that the contract thing is just a Salesforce formality and should you be a perform well, you will be converted in a year or less. I saw first-hand a couple of very high-performing recruiters get let go simply because they refused to play the ridiculous political game that is expected of you. Recruiting here is a rat race and lacks any nuance or creativity. As a recruiter, you do not have a voice or opinion. You are a sheep in the herd following the leaders. The ""leaders"" only care about branding, how the company is perceived, and how they themselves look to their leaders. They care very little about the actual recruiters doing the work. Recruiters are at the very bottom of the totem pole. If you hint at any disscontempt with your role, team, manager, company - you will be shunned. I can't speak for all of the recruiting teams and the entire company, but this is my honest feedback about Sales Recruiting at Salesforce. I wanted to provide honest feedback to future candidates who are considering leaving full-time roles for this often unpleasant role. If you choose to, use this as a resume booster if you're trying to break into the tech industry and then get out. Understand that the behavior you will witness there and the treatment you will likely receive is not okay. This is not how respectable companies operate. There are so many better opportunities at other SaaS companies where you will be treated with dignity and respect.",40 people found this review helpful

If you have that it is great but, when you don't it can feel defeating. Personally, I have experienced the good and the bad with this. Training - Trailhead is a wonderful tool that provides a great introduction to many products/services. It's self-guided and you can pursue what interests you at your own pace. Time off to volunteer - Again a great benefit but, your manager has to be supportive of your endeavors. Employees are encouraged to give back using the 1/1/1 model. On one hand you are praised if you meet or exceed the number of hours you give back. If you don't have a manager or a team that does a lot of volunteer work, you might be criticized or singled out for ""wasting time."" Free Snacks - This is nice when you need a 3:00 snack or can't get out for lunch. Access to great perks - Wellness activities, a gym, workout classes, a benefit you can use to pay for massages. Unlimited vacation time, sometimes free tickets to events.","""Diversity"" - There's a good lip service but, the reality is that upper management is mostly white. Until there is massive change in how recruiting and cultivating talent happens in the tech industry white guys are going to begat more white guys. Chances are pretty good they don't have friends or connections who are POC. This also holds true from people who come from other tech companies. When rats jump the ship they tend to bring other rats with them. Not so subtle hints that you have to hold a ""right"" set of beliefs/values - you have to get onboard or made to feel like an outsider. If you question or don't hold a certain The idea that Salesforce can save the human race - Salesforce is an innovative tech company with products and services that help customers do business. Be that! While SF is the biggest and holds a huge marketshare, it has created this idea that it can somehow save the world. Surrounded by lots of people who don't actually work with you - there are some teams that have a larger representation in certain hubs but, if you have a team that is largely based in one hub it can get lonely being surrounded by people who are largely irrelevant to your daily work life.

2196,73,Extremely disappointing experience,"May 17, 2020 - Account Executive",2.0,"Nice office, free snacks, healthcare - all the usual perks you would expect from a successful SaaS company A few recent hires in very senior management in ANZ (incl. Pip, Ian) have been received positively.","Your experience here will completely depend on your direct manager and reporting line - and that's a very mixed bag of people. There is a lot of ego at play in some leaders and a total lack of EQ/empathy - be sure to interview your manager through the hiring process. There is nothing as demotivating as a sales manager who doesn't have basic leadership skills or self awareness. They have over hired Account Executives as they believe that this will drive limitless growth in the region. Result being that everyone has territories that are too small to give them a reasonable chance at succeeding. Attainment is poor even from those who have been with the business a number of years and have been successful in their previous roles. This DOESN'T stop huge amounts of pressure being placed on each individual to hit pipe gen and sales targets (even during COVID). Very few people have hit their quota or anywhere near it in the last few years. 5-7 years ago this probably would have been a great place to work but it has changed considerably since then. People don't trust the anonymous feedback surveys so the business doesn't understand the huge amount of grumbling that is happening behind the scenes. AEs are unhappy and many are looking elsewhere. But management also does its best to make you fearful about leaving in order to keep you in place to avoid more turnover. They made most of their customer success group redundant last year. Aside from COVID, there seems to be a major aversion to letting people work from home which to me highlights that there is a lack of trust in their people. Some management speak down to their team like they are children. Very few female leaders in the sales team - not sure the organisation is honestly asking themselves why this is? People talk the talk about diversity because it's a SFDC value but that's not necessarily how they really think or execute. I don't even think most of them are capable of thinking outside their own experience.",18 people found this review helpful

I fell for the hype, the branding, the “perks”, the “culture”, the philanthropy. Now, I can speak from experience that the culture is fake. Benioff might mean well and the company might provide perks so that from those on the outside looking in, this is a great place to work. I just know that during the months I’ve been here, I haven’t had any time to see the Salesforce park or have coffee in the Ohana floor. I’m on a small team and other than my manager, the others have not said 3 words to me, unless I’m talking to them in a group setting. No “how was your day?” Or “Do you want me to show you around?” How’s that for culture? I tried to walk to a meeting with a team member and she completely ignored me. I’ve never felt so lonely at a job. The Ohana seating makes it impossible to get to know anyone. I am so busy from the moment I get in but accomplish nothing. We have so many meetings... meetings 85% of my days to talk about nothing that can’t get accomplished through emails. Or the meeting is about the same things we just met about 2 hours ago. The culture is not about being productive or getting things done. It’s about looking/feeling like important topics are being discussed, sitting in conference rooms, and over complicating the strategy. We just spin and spin and then we go home, and do it again the next day. Every single thing I’ve worked on since I started have been scratched or changed because the process or overall strategy has changed. How does anyone work around here or get anything done in this type of setting and without concrete decisions being made? The on-boarding is very chaotic and management isn’t aligned with the actual on-boarding process. They don’t factor in how long the mandatory trailhead courses take or take the time to onboard you. Becoming Salesforce and Bootcamps are just thrown into the schedule and are disruptive to the day-to-day workflow. (I’ve had to reschedule because there are other meetings that conflict). I met someone, also new but on another team, who complained she doesn’t have time for bootcamp. Maybe it’s not necessary? Just show the new employees how to navigate the elevators in the tower... this took me weeks to figure out on my own.",50 people found this review helpful

If you're an older employee, don't expect any of your previous work experience to mean anything. If it didn't happen at Salesforce, it didn't happen at all. Compensation is definitely lower than the other big tech firms in San Francisco. Stop using so Hawaiian jargon and ridiculous costume characters. It's a business, not a pre-school.

2233,110,"Mostly positive experience, even after my role was eliminated",,4.0,"There are a lot of perks of working at Salesforce, at least for my role. I had the option of working from home and many people in my role did so as well. The office has open (""Ohana"") seating to accommodate that. This suited my personality well but if you prefer face-to-face meetings with your team members, this might be a negative for you. Throughout my time at Salesforce I had coworkers and managers that lived in different states than me. Which is fine nowadays considering all the virtual meeting options. There are free snacks and drinks in the break room. If you become a parent while at Salesforce, you have the option of taking up to 6 months paternity leave at 80% pay, which is outstanding at least by US standards. I never ended up taking the full 6 months for either of the kids I had while employed at Salesforce, I guess out of a dumb sense of duty to my coworkers and Salesforce. Don't do what I did. Take the full 6 months and don't regret it. I enjoyed all the people that I worked with and I had the opportunity to work with a lot of big name accounts. Overall I thought it was a positive experience. My role was eliminated which is why I had to leave Salesforce. I was not happy about it but they were very generous. After my role was eliminated and my role responsibilities were taken away, they continued to pay me for two months while I looked for internal and external opportunities. I was able to find another opportunity outside of Salesforce prior to the end of the 2nd month. Had I not found another role, however, they would have given me a generous severance package in addition to what I had already been paid. I would imagine that is a lot more than most other companies would do.","My role (and other roles in my part of the organization) became very specialized over time, which I assume to was to help with efficiency in client work. But it also meant that I was doing a lot of the same tasks over and over again. I found there was little opportunity to branch out to take on responsibilities of other roles or to learn another role. I knew several people who left Salesforce because they became frustrated at their lack of advancement. People in my role also had a billable utilization goal of 36 hours a week. If you did not have that much time billable, it was seen as an issue. But you are not always in charge of how much work you had or what work was available. Which is true of many businesses, I know. Also, if you wanted to take time off, you needed to find a backup (or multiple backups) to take on your account work while you are out. Which can be difficult if everyone is trying to work 36 billable hours a week. And you had to train them if they had never worked on your account before. So taking time off was a chore, at least for my role. I ended up taking only maybe 2 weeks off during a year. I regularly hit my cap of 300 PTO hours and stopped accumulating PTO. And the billable utilization goal was pushed so much that they started tying it to the quarterly bonuses. In the end, it didn't end up meaning much because my role was eliminated even though at the time I was regularly billing 36+ hours a week. Ultimately, I would preach to not drink the Kool Aid. They preach that everyone that works there is part of the ""Ohana"" and is family but don't buy it. This is probably not new to a lot of you, but it's just marketing. They are a business first. They don't really care about you. You have to look out for yourself first and foremost. If you start buying into it even just a little bit, that's when you don't take as much time off as you should or don't take your full 6 months of paternity leave out of some sense of obligation to the ""Ohana."" Take advantage of everything they give you down to the last PTO hour because they will happily discard you without hesitation when they don't see value in you as an ""Ohana"" member any longer. If you feel stagnant in your role, use your free work time to help yourself or get out of there because they will not help you take another role.",13 people found this review helpful

2281,158,Fake culture - it’s all branding,,1.0,"Comp package is decent, benefits are good","I’ve only been with the company for a few months, and it was my dream company to work for. I fell for the hype, the branding, the “perks”, the “culture”, the philanthropy. Now, I can speak from experience that the culture is fake. Benioff might mean well and the company might provide perks so that from those on the outside looking in, this is a great place to work. I just know that during the months I’ve been here, I haven’t had any time to see the Salesforce park or have coffee in the Ohana floor. I’m on a small team and other than my manager, the others have not said 3 words to me, unless I’m talking to them in a group setting. No “how was your day?” Or “Do you want me to show you around?” How’s that for culture? I tried to walk to a meeting with a team member and she completely ignored me. I’ve never felt so lonely at a job. The Ohana seating makes it impossible to get to know anyone. I am so busy from the moment I get in but accomplish nothing. We have so many meetings... meetings 85% of my days to talk about nothing that can’t get accomplished through emails. Or the meeting is about the same things we just met about 2 hours ago. The culture is not about being productive or getting things done. It’s about looking/feeling like important topics are being discussed, sitting in conference rooms, and over complicating the strategy. We just spin and spin and then we go home, and do it again the next day. Every single thing I’ve worked on since I started have been scratched or changed because the process or overall strategy has changed. How does anyone work around here or get anything done in this type of setting and without concrete decisions being made? The on-boarding is very chaotic and management isn’t aligned with the actual on-boarding process. They don’t factor in how long the mandatory trailhead courses take or take the time to onboard you. Becoming Salesforce and Bootcamps are just thrown into the schedule and are disruptive to the day-to-day workflow. (I’ve had to reschedule because there are other meetings that conflict). I met someone, also new but on another team, who complained she doesn’t have time for bootcamp. Maybe it’s not necessary? Just show the new employees how to navigate the elevators in the tower... this took me weeks to figure out on my own.",50 people found this review helpful

2288,165,"Not what it used to be, would not recommend",,2.0,"Great snacks and cool offices, decent benefits, casual office attire","This used to be my dream job, I loved telling everyone I worked here and how awesome it was. Then as time went on, I realized it was all fake. The marketing team makes you believe that everything is perfect even when it's not. There is no way to move up even though people say you can. You will be promised one thing then later told the opposite. To move to a different role internally you have to move to a position of the same level or below, you cannot go up (called diagonally) in another department. Even if you make it happen, they keep you at the same pay and level for 6+ months so you will do more work for the same pay. There is NO INCENTIVE TO STAY!! I have known so many people who leave for this reason, then come back a year or so later 3-6 grades higher with better pay and benefits. Recruiters love that because they say it shows how great the company is that people come back, they could have saved themselves time and money by just promoting or transferring the person to the place they wanted to be at. My manager left after a few years and then they hired someone externally who had NO MANAGEMENT EXPERIENCE EVER!!! He was the worst manager I have ever had by far, he was rude, disrespectful, sexist, inappropriate, and completely useless. I was appalled at the way he treated his employees and when I brought it up to HR they basically said I couldn't prove it. Then other employees from a completely different department witnessed him scream at people and they went to HR and still the case was closed because ""lack of evidence"". Several employees were asked to work overtime without pay which is illegal for hourly employees. When I told my bosses boss that I was leaving, they offered me a promotion, but I would have had to move cross-country, and I was told there was no budget for moving costs, so I would pay them all on my own. As for salary, since it was a ""cheaper cost of living"" that there would be no increase. I laughed at this insulting offer to work more, have more responsibility and no increase in money while moving cross country. I declined the offer and they were somehow shocked. I left and never looked back, I am so much happier now that I left.",9 people found this review helpful

You'll do well if you can smile and say ""everything is fine"" while the building you're in is actively burning to the ground. I was sent on multiple interviews for a position within the company in a department that I wanted to transfer to before being told they would not actually hire me and were just sending me on the interviews for reasons completely unknown to me. To be clear, there was a hiring freeze already in place and they STILL wanted me to interview more with no actual plan to hire/transfer me. The ""Family First"" policy is garbage. They said this motto about a million times when I worked there. When I needed it so I could care for my family member (My fiancee needed major back surgery), I was told this would not be a problem, was later told this was a major problem and she wasn't family, and then, after we got married, no one checked to see what I said about us being married was true. To be clear, Salesforce wanted to tell me who could be my family but then didn't care if it was actually true in the end. I could have lied and had the wedding we actually wanted and had been planning, instead of rushing to get married at the courthouse so I could get the leave and she could get the surgery on schedule. There doesn't seem to be a strong decision-making process. I was sent on retreats I didn't need to go on to hang out with people I never saw or communicated with while I needed to be at home to handle important matters. I was told this trip was imperative and I couldn't miss it. When I got there, no one knew what the trip was for and it turned out to just be drinking and games and a pep rally or two.

I hate to break it to them, but smart/talented recruiters do not find Salesforce Recruiting a compelling enough organization to work for. If leadership wants to retain people, they need to have productive conversations around succession planning and salary increases. Salesforce Recruiters and Sourcers severely underpaid. Recruiting leadership preaches about how Salesforce is ahead of the game with URM (under-represented minorities) recruiting. In reality, it is nothing but a numbers game for them. The more hires they make, the better they look in front of Marc Benioff.

Team members, management, and overall company culture are very supportive. Management will set you up to succeed by providing all the resources, trainings, and other tools needed to make it to ""get to the next level"" and advance your career. I personally have no immediate plans to switch teams because I currently love the work that I am doing right now. I have seen people easily move across different teams and organizations (lateral and vertical) within Salesforce without issue. This is important to those that want to eventually work on different projects/teams/technologies within the company. The company promotes a lot of volunteering for employees and is consistently active within the community. It's recommended and encouraged for employees to volunteer and give back and they set a side a large amount of VTO (Volunteer Time Off) for you to do so. I absolutely love this because volunteering makes such a big impact to those in need. You are treated with dignity and respect working here. I have never come across any issues while working here but there is always an open channel to communicate with management (direct management or other management) if you do encounter anything. Senior management is very honest and transparent during meetings/emails/town halls, ect. with what is going on within our organization and company as a whole. Besides all of the stuff mentioned above, there are: - Excellent Work/Life Balance (I've never worked a weekend, I get off on time each day, and have never felt any stress while working here) . All of our work as a team is consistently completed by the deadlines too! - Unlimited opportunities to learn and grow your career with tools/resources readily available. (The company promotes enablement and provides you with a bountiful of resources to get to where you want to go in your career) It's just up to YOU to activity take initiative and take advantage of them! - You have the ability to take Professional Led Salesforce Certification classes for free - Tuition Reimbursement - Commuter benefits - ESPP - Amazing health insurance packages - Awesome views from the top of the Salesforce Tower - Ability to work from home every now and then (varies from team to team and role) - Baristas available in the main buildings to provide free handcrafted coffee and tea - Professional Chef's making food at the top of the Salesforce Tower and in Salesforce East - Arcade games, pool tables, ping pong tables, foosball, - Various ERG Groups to join (they do a lot of events that are fun and good for the community) - Social groups to join (Board games, video games, camera clubs, exercise/workout classes) - Lots of comfy sofas/lounge chairs - Access to the Salesforce Park - Awesome holiday parties!!! - HUGE Dreamforce event every year (Really fun and informative) All and all, this is absolutely the best company I have ever worked for and I currently don't have any intensions of leaving. 😃",NONE!!!

Very toxic, backstabbing politics going on amongst executive assistants which creates an entire group of disgruntled, distrustful, and power hungry EAs and makes most EAs carry a bad reputation at Salesforce. Execs and managers who have EAs: some of them need serious management training and learn how to treat everyone under them fairly. This was by far some of the worst treatment I’ve ever seen from an exec who had an EA. Micromanaging, having other people spy on the EA and report back to him about the EA's whereabouts and movement.. The EA was treated like a prisoner. Also, there are some EAs who support C-level people and they act as if they are the exec's themselves. They wield their execs' status for their own power and control over others. It's ridiculous and I don't know if the execs who have EAs even know that their EAs are doing this. I hated working with any execs who had EAs. It was always a massive hinderance to my work progress. I don't understand Salesforce and the EA culture.. some are really great EAs but some are terrible and unfortunately they are the EAs at the top.. usually supporting SVP and up.

This shouldn't be a problem, but since the HQ is in San Francisco, people are reminded of all the perks and opportunities that abound just around the corner (or in Silicon Valley).

2432,49,Nightmare on California Street and Freaked out on Fremont,,1.0,"Snacks. Smart people. Company does give back to the community but ironically, squashes their own people while serving the needy. Starting salary for Commercial AE was 100K. Overtime (that everyone lies about) is the only guarantee for additional income and that's only available since the class action lawsuit forced all Corporate Sales to become hourly employees--that happened in 2011.","Others have said it and I wholeheartedly agree. This was the worst professional experience of my career. Learned a lot about how truly horrible a company can treat their employees. Really hard to get a job here unless you know someone and I did--what I didn't know was how much I was lied to with the promise of making a living. The only people who are happy here are the young kids who are striving to achieve success early on in their careers and those who have been at the company for years who are favored and given the good patches to actually make their goal. Such an insidious culture with back stabbing, soul less individuals that starts with the top management and continues through middle management. They are the worst. The Junior VPs who have been there for years, so made it early on but they are worse than the Executive VPs because they really have no talent and have no clue how to manage good people. Turnover rate is ridiculous and the actual number of people who make their goal is so incredibly low. The cube culture ensures that your cold calling (which is mostly what it has become) is heard by your boss so he, and the tenured people around you, can berate you for not moving the deal along. And don't even think about working from home--get there at 7am or you are looked at as a loser for not being committed to the cause. Selfish, manic, loud, seductive people do well here for a while or at least until they slip up and end up with the Dakota patch. Or quit because they can not take it anymore. Drunken culture too which is encouraged by the annual Christmas party which costs millions--it's lavish and luxe--and shameful and gluttonous.

They just have small talk and do what it takes to get the job done well. Since your team is who you're with all day and who you talk to most of the time, it's kind of important. I wish it was the other way around, where my team was wanted to talk too much and spend more time hanging out than I did. The employees are kind of old here, so it's just not what I'm used to I suppose. Also, spoiled as I already am here, I will always be jealous of companies that have free cafeterias because I can't cook.",5 people found this review helpful
2457,74,Best Sales Training I have ever had,"Oct 29, 2014 - Account Executive - Small/Medium Business (SMB)",3.0,"The company takes training extremely seriously and within the first 3-6 months you will be given an absolute crash course in Sales Training and modern SaaS selling techniques. Most of the people are fantastic, the benefits are great. If you get the right territory you will make a lot more money than your peers. Things are constantly changing and there are always opportunities to move around in the organization. Salesforce is definitely the best product in the industry for CRM.","The Culture in the Chicago office took a nose dive this year. With fast growth a lot of the wrong people were promoted to leadership positions and have sucked some of the life out of the organization. (On the plus side things move fast so they probably wont be in those roles for too much longer). Their is also a clear political path to success, be liked by the group that is running the show and you will be rewarded with a greater share of the potential sources of commission compared to your peers (There is a loosely defined territory policy which can either be a huge benefit or detriment to your career). The downside is that it appears most of the ""have's"" already have been selected.",2 people found this review helpful

The company is well respected and constantly developing or buying new products. If you get the right accounts and manager support you can make a ton of $$$. I personally know a handful of people who made 7 figures.",Your success in sales is highly dependent on your patch(account base) which is hard to predict coming in the front door. The intensity of the company is great but the work/life balance if off as the demands of the job creep into all aspects of your life. Sales quotas go up every year and territories decrease which can be hard to keep up with. The product offering is getting more and more complicated and hard to keep up with. Management changes all the time as I had four managers in a span of 18 months. Their product offering while extensive does not do well in certain verticals so make sure your accounts are in those good verticals. The core CRM product is too complicated and not intuitive as they make it seem.,1 person found this review helpful

There is massive title inflation. 0-1 year of experience managing people marks most directors, and even many senior directors. There is a serious problem of cronyism in many departments. VPs promote who they want, when they want irrespective of team feedback or even despite what are believed to be established policies. VP-level leadership exhibits schizophrenic decision making, CYA behaviors and abrasive comportment. This makes for highly stressful working environments and is a key cause of the well-known burnout at Salesforce. Many leaders at Salesforce have never done a job this big before which can lend to insecurity and erratic or absent decision making.

You will be given a territory that will ultimately dictate how well you perform. Some AEs are given 2-3 territories while others are given just one. Regardless of your territory, you will have the exact same quota as those with larger ones. Its a numbers game to management. Your manager will want 2-3 of his or her AEs to do really well while everyone else struggles. You will have a monthly quota, your manager will be tasked with grinding you every month for every last dollar possible you can bring in.

The benefits are fantastic, and you'll earn a lot of money if you're smart, motivated, and get things done. One key piece of advice that I have is to be proactive about your career. It can be tempting to code all day long, but you'll need to take a step back every now and then to chart your course over the next several releases to get ahead and stay in control of your career. If you don't, then others may put you into a direction that you might not like. Take charge and make your case to others, and resources will flow to you if others agree with your vision. That actually ties in well with my next point. Every year, each of us must create a ""V2MOM,"" which is Marc Benioff's method of distilling down what you want to do over the next year from both a high level and from a detailed level. You start off with a single vision, list your values, determine the methods that will realize your vision, identify the obstacles that may prevent you from realizing your vision, and create metrics that can measure how you know when you've realized your vision. Many people secretly blow it off and just copy their managers' V2MOMs, but if used properly, it really can make a difference in your own career. As one of the leaders had said, you get from it what you put into it. If you really embrace and use the V2MOM, you'll go far both at work and in life. The culture increasingly uses the V2MOM in its decision making and resource allocations. But don't worry; it's not a cult or anything remotely like that. Salesforce.com invests heavily in its employees. From the high-end office space to comfortable interiors, generous benefits, and firm commitment to meeting and exceeding workplace fairness, policy, and procedure rules and laws, anyone can be free to be themselves at Salesforce.com and do the best work of their lives. I know I am :). I'm an openly gay male, and that has never been held against me (as far as I'm aware, at least).","I hear that politics and such exist at the higher levels, but that's fortunately not visible much at the individual contributor level. If you have a good manager, you don't hear of such things, and you get to just focus on your work and career. So perhaps this is really a 'pro' than a 'con.' Priorities can and do shift regularly. It's really a part of the nature of software development. Top-down changes of directions can and do occur, though most have been huge successes. If you want a place where you go off into a corner and code on one thing for months or years, then Salesforce.com is not the place for you. Everything is collaborative, and you must be able to work well in a team. If you don't, then you'll hopefully learn quickly :-). Work-life balance can be difficult to achieve if you are eager to help everyone who comes your way with questions. It's really a matter of self-discipline to achieve a work-life balance, and it's almost all within your control.",7 people found this review helpful

2611,228,"IT ""Leadership""","Apr 19, 2014 - Manager in San Francisco, CA",1.0,"Most people in IT, Finance and other support departments seem to be here to get the salesforce name on their resume. That is definitely a plus. Pay seems good, but maybe not when considering the hours. Enormous turnover leads to lots of opportunities for advancement if you can outshine flashy external hires from consulting backgrounds.","Inflated titles and absent support staff leads to many ""managers"" and ""directors"" who are purely individual contributers. All managers and directors have individual contributor duties. For people managers, headcount are constantly changing--just because you have a team of 6 this year doesn't prevent half of them from being taken away next year. Management structures change multiple times per year, and even change above the CIO. The internal systems are falling apart and leaders all the way up are much more focused on politics and image. They completely neglect anything objectively meaningful or helpful. The environment has gotten so toxic in the last couple years that leaders semi-openly talk about trying to get out of here. The CIO doesn't lead the organization at all, and everyone goes to either the ""chief of staff"" or the head of the PMO instead. The chief of staff is not qualified / competent to run a single department, let alone being a de facto head of IT. IT is forced to pay for all related costs out of the IT G&A budget with no charge-backs. This inflates our budget and hides that we're actually significantly underfunded, especially considering the technical debt. (we've almost figured out wifi in the last year, but we still need wired hubs in the conference rooms) Much worse than the state of IT is the state of Finance. Every month we're asked to change behavior because something in accounting /finance changed, or something was miscoded or reclassified and no one knew until after the books closed. People and processes change so often that there is no chance of hitting your budget honestly, or even understanding where it came from. We are told that it's worse to be under budget than overbought, because if we're under in any quarter, we potentially lose that budget going forward. You can imagine the consequences of that policy. The financial systems are a joke. We don't know how to support finance and consequently, they can't support us. What we report is massaged by accounting manually in Excel to a degree that we cannot effectively speak to our own numbers. As a result everyone involved is frustrated, failing, and looking for an out. No one in leadership is willing to acknowledge the fundamental problems as the culture requires us to be ever-positve in public and to ""just make it work"", then report success. I believe this is because (1) CEO is a salesman first, leader second, and doesn't want to hear it, and (2) because everyone up the chain would rather claim success and move to a different company, than stay and actually try to fix anything.",14 people found this review helpful

PTO is really poor compared to our parent company SalesForce Benefits are not up to par with our parent company SalesForce, try to find ET benefits and then find SF benefits. You'll notice ET's benefits are impossible to find and SF brags about theirs. That should be your sign. If you're assigned to SOW in Services or Support, there is little to no incentive to move you into something challenging. Most changes are done because of attrition as the organization are pretty flat outside of product. Salary bands don't exist, or if they do they are very lax.

Highly recommend joining the Salesforce team,"Jul 25, 2015 - Anonymous Employee in San Francisco, CA",5.0,"-Huge emphasis on the importance of charitable giving and being environmentally sustainable (backed by 6 paid volunteer days per employee annually, $5000 annual employee match for charitable giving, frequent internal charitable events) -Prioritizes engaging employees by aligning personal career goals with each employee's duties and encouraging movement between functions and departments throughout the company -Incredibly intelligent workforce: Salesforce is able to use its strong brandname to hire only the top talent and as a result has an environment where you are constantly challenged and learning, which continuously develops your own skill set. (Less than 1% of applicants receive employment offers) -Strong community environment: Salesforce has been able to build a corporate family unlike any company I've been a part of before. People honestly care for each other and will go out of their way to look out for past and present employees. Salesforce focuses on working as a team rather than separate individuals which develops a sense of inclusion. -Incredible parties: Salesforce certainly caters to a more extroverted, lively and connected personality by having frequent social and networking events throughout the year -$100/mth employee fitness benefit and health benefits that are largely absorbed by the company. Free yoga classes and espresso bars are also offered in some offices -Offices are generally situated in the heart of cities rather than in suburbs",-Headcount growing perhaps too quickly which could transform the community feel to a more corporate environment -Does not offer full meals (light snacks and beverages are provided) -Signals of a more corporate future ahead evidenced by a shift away from local vendors to their global competitors,62 people found this review helpful

However, for those of us who are in the services side of the business, the resources and enablement materials at our disposal is not as bountiful as they are, for say, SEs and AEs, so we not set up for success as much, making the job more difficult. - While Salesforce often says they put the customer at the center of everything they do, those who are not customer facing sometimes lack the ability to put themselves in customer shoes, but those of us who do interact with customers rely upon other internal teams to make them successful, so often times the biggest challenge is navigating our massive organization and hoping you'll be able to get the attention of the person who can help, and hoping they have the resources and time to help your customer.",Be the first to find this review helpful

Idk where these people came from but they are micromanaging, unrealistic, unhelpful, insulting...like the list really goes on.

And don't even think about leaving the sales org. Managers don't help and People across the company look down on BDRs. Also, the pay compared to other places is not good at all. $50K base in seat and after you promote to the next step. OTE increases in next role but not base salary no matter what you promo into. - High metrics, low commission - Like any other sales role, you are made to feel as though you are only as good as your numbers - The metrics are INSANE. Everyone knows people are just BS'ing their way through bc the metrics are so unrealistic - Work-life balance is horrible if you're actually trying to do your job the legit way and its high stress all the time despite whatever is going on in the world - Snobby AEs that are selfish but no one cares if you're hitting your number",15 people found this review helpful

It is a company that cares for her employees and her customers plus got very innovative solutions. The onboarding was amazing and the company does make you feel proud that you work there.","Equality: There is a good focus on equality which is good as it is needed. In my eyes there is a lack of female managers or managers that understand how to use the strengths of having woman in the sales team. Overall, all managers have a checkbox they need to complete by hiring or interviewing woman, I think in the end they will be better in also give specific trainings to managers on how to actually manage a woman better. Remote worker: The biggest downfall of SF. A remote worker means they expect you to be in the office on a weekly base, rather more than less. Being used to work with Lync or Skype, there is a lack of the internal technology (acceptance) to make remote workers more involved remote instead of face to face.

Good paid time off to do charity work. Good commission if you are in the right part of the business,As with many US based firms many of the mangers I had were based in the US. Most have zero idea on life in EMEA both business and culturally as they never got on a plane and been bothered to come here. This made them some of the most ignorant and useless people managers I have had the misfortune to work for and sadly nothing the UK management team could change or influence. If you join one of the companies which SFDC has taken over then good luck. It can take years for systems to join up and merged and this can lead to a huge duplication of effort and time. I did see some people make some good money here but lots running around chasing completely unattainable sales targets year after year. They seemed caught up in the hype rather than making money. Despite telling everyone that there are lots of career opportunities in the UK I did not see many at all. Again your career will be down to knowing the chosen three of four people within the business who can help you to get there. It seems like a long and tiresome process. Many of the management have come from the same background and company and this management style does show sadly. A few but not all where rude and unaaproachable despite constantly telling the company of their open door policy.

3098,214,Account executive,"Aug 5, 2016 - Account Executive in Sandyford",1.0,Having in on your cv but really no pros... Such a bad experience from the get go. Someone who hit over 100% on numbers each money.... Money wasn't the driver but career... And there is non,Where to start.. The management alone is shocking. No leaders at all. Idea of leading a team is trying to trip then up and bully tactics. Egos come to play and there is allot of clicks in this business. If you not in the click you won't get promoted. What I really mean is if you don't do as they say and jump when they want.... You won't go anywhere. It's a real shame as the company based in the US where there is culture and values is not the same in the Dublin office. Management are doing you no justice as several people won't even apply for jobs as the word on the street in Dublin is there is one manager now promoted to a higher position who no one wants to work FOR. What happened to working with a company to succeed. But seems she is also untouchable as her click is supporting her. Real shame as in Dublin word spreads. Dublin office and managers in there are too far from the real culture of the company and the US Aren't getting the real story.,15 people found this review helpful

User interface is implemented with a proprietary framework (Aura) that is universally criticized by its users as inferior to Aspect and other industry standards, but is ferociously defended by company insiders. Similarly, storage is done via a proprietary layer atop a small number of massive Oracle databases. This means that one database outage affects a large number of customers. The Oracle centric mindset of the ""old boys"" has been incredibly resistant to change. Unit testing is slowly gaining acceptance, but is still by far the exception to the rule. The monolithic nature of the code base means that tests may take several days to catch regressions.

You’d expect a company like Salesforce to have a smooth process. But here’s the real story- My onboarding and interview was an absolute nightmare. This was my dream company, so obviously when I received an offer from them, I accepted it, even if it meant taking a huge pay cut. These guys would leverage Salesforce US culture into talking you down for salaries but would say shamelessly that Salesforce has a transparent pay scale. When I entered the company, I found out that I was the least paid employee in the team. Anyhoo, I accepted the offer and it was their turn to send laptop and other peripherals. Well they didn’t, their procurement team never replied, not on slack, not on calls, not anywhere and I had to bring senior management into this. Well after 15 days of joining, I had received the laptop but mind you even though you don’t have your company phone or company laptop, they’ll start evaluating your performance from day 1, because dude you are in Business Development. So you gotta be an Einstien and a God maybe to do 500 billion things at one time and managers even then would find a way to complain. They expect us to work for 10 hours every day, attend useless meetings, and work like a machine without taking a breath. And they’ll preach about the helping culture of Salesforce, lol. The AEs don’t respond on time, hell even the managers themselves don’t respond until you ping them again and again. And they want us to feel gratitude for the company bevause it pays salary. They have 0 empathy for their employees, they turn deaf ear to our problems. I am suffocating here but I can’t teach out to anyone because guess what everyone is the same. This is a typical employee exploiting company which has created a bubble of a good work culture. PS- this is just for India.

There is a lot of opportunity to move around within the company and learn new roles and duties, which is lucky, because in order to move up you will have to move around.","The promotion system is broken. Period. Only promoting 1-3% of your workforce every 6 months is a broken process and gives over-perfoming employees two options if they don't get promoted that round - wait and see, or move into a new role within the company at the higher title. Or, the route I took, leave the company. I understand putting a cap on the amount of promotions each team can have, but it can cause teammates to have to wait YEARS for a promotion they should have just been given. And finally, ""Ohana"" is BS in my opinion when it comes to those in leadership. Those not in leadership totally embody that spirit, but the amount of politics, backstabbing and egotistical leaders in this company is unacceptable. When you disagree with someone who doesn't understand your job but is in a leadership role, you are punished, get duties you enjoy doing taken away from you, and told to make things better without any guidance on what is actually broken. Salary is also way under in comparison to other companies. Salesforce used to be at the top of salary ranges, and have unfortunately not kept up with the times. Every year the employee survey continually highlights these issues, and now with some of the top employees in the company moving on to greener pastures, I really hope they tackle these problems.

3538,103,A GREAT Opportunity,"Apr 25, 2022 - Account Executive in Irvine, CA",5.0,"Joined the company about 6 months ago thinking I understood selling, and how to close business having spent 13 years in various AM & BD roles, but Salesforce takes the art of selling to another level entirely, and gives you the at-bats and the opportunity to succeed at every turn. They truly poured millions into learning and development, with more resources and training you could ask for or find anywhere else. Everyone makes you feel welcomed from the get-go, and there is a true mentality of ""we are in the trenches together"", where everyone is more than willing to help the new folks at the drop of a hat, because they've been there, and they care about their colleagues. It really is impressive. The compensation is lucrative, and the spiffs are insane! The office environment is very casual, and fun. Management, at least my chain of command, are in your corner and helping you whenever they can, and they do not pull punches (which I love), so you always know where you stand with them. They're tough, and so is the job, but more than fair, and highly rewarding.","I am not going to sugar coat it, onboarding and finding your sea legs once you have your territory, in a remote environment is REALLY TOUGH. You will feel lost at times, and wonder how you are going to hit any quota. There are so many resources available for anything you are trying to do that it can seem overwhelming; the phrase everyone repeats when you start is ""its like drinking from a firehose"", which I brushed off initially, because what job worth doing is easy to get started in? but they mean it, and you should believe it. SOOO much info is pumped into your brain when you start, it seems nearly impossible to grasp everything. The comp plan is wildly complicated, so you really have to take the time to understand how you make money so you can focus your efforts appropriately.",3 people found this review helpful

3582,147,"Amazing experience, fantastic company",,5.0,"Salesforce has a really solid business model, with a subscription-based approach to software that was revolutionary when it was first introduced 23 years ago. This subscription-based approach means that ongoing revenue can be relied on, for all customers that remain with the company. Since the attrition, or the loss of customers, is very low, this means that the cash flow for this business is very reliable and predictable over the long term. The company really strives to gain the trust and to ensure that customers are successful. These happy customers then become highly referenceable, and recommend our solution for others. Our product has become such a vital part of their business that it is also very sticky over the long term. As our company continues to acquire new capabilities, our solution becomes even more enticing and relevant, since we can address and integrate a broad cross-section of the needs of each of our customers (Marketing, Sales, Commerce, Service, Analytics). We deliver a comprehensive enterprise software solution, which is cohesive and integrated in ways that no other company can provide. In addition to this, we constantly think of ways to innovate and make our customers lives easier. We are able to digitize and improve the efficiency of a broad cross-section of enterprises out there who do not focus on digital solutions as their core business. All of these factors together represent a very strong opportunity for continued growth of this business. Salesforce has also been executing really well on surmounting many of the more difficult technical challenges that they faced due to the fact that the product is based on legacy code. There is technical debt related to the database, also there is a major migration underway to move to the public cloud. The company has executed incredibly well on these and many other challenges internally. The culture is incomparable. The leadership of the company have a genuine concern for each employee, and a real investment in doing the right thing for the community. The company takes a leading role in helping to champion initiatives that address homelessness and environmental issues for example. We also are really committed to the success of all of our stakeholders, including employees, customers, partners, communities, and all of the trailblazers who form the broader salesforce community. The ecosystem of administrators, architects and developers who are part of our space has continued to grow, and the company is also really proactive in helping to develop the skills of those people that might be interested in growing a career with our products.","There are not many downsides. The culture is really open and accepting. They are very accommodating to the needs of their employees, and they earn a significant degree of loyalty in return. Because this is such a great company, many people are willing to go the extra mile to keep this good thing going. There may be some mild challenges in terms of managing the culture internally, and ensuring that every group feels included, and part of the Salesforce family. Still, our leader ship clearly spends a lot of time focusing on the correct approach here, and ensuring that there are enough opportunities for people to connect with like minded coworkers, and to ensure that they are recognized and appreciated.",Be the first to find this review helpful

A majority of reviews on here for Salesforce are fake, written by bots, and created by Salesforce themselves. In reality, this is an absolutely horrible place to work. You will be thrown into a meat grinder with unrealistic expectations pushed on you, and virtually no training or guidance when you start. You'll realize in a few short weeks that coming to this company was the absolute worst decision you've ever made in your life, and that reading reviews on this website are causing people to destroy their lives by coming to this company. It's all an illusion. The culture is horrible and toxic. You'll be chewed up and spit out without remorse. DO NOT COME TO THIS COMPANY!!! DO NOT BELIEVE THE FAKE REVIEWS!!!",9 people found this review helpful

Salesforce lives and leads with its values from the top down and encourages transparency and feedback throughout the organization. - For a large enterprise, Salesforce works hard to ensure we are agile and nimble. The company is not afraid to fail fast, pivot strategies, execute on new ideas and proactively lead with a bold vision in the face of a rapidly changing world. The phrase ""Better, better, never best"" is a great way to describe the culture. - Individually in my customer-facing sales role, I enjoy being able to work with so many different types of businesses and executives. It's rewarding to help clients succeed, transform, and adapt their businesses - and it's also a fantastic learning experience for my own development. Because Salesforce has such a huge platform, we are enabled to have conversations with every business department and are empowered to deliver real value. While we are selling a technical product, working at Salesforce allows me to elevate the conversation by leaning on Salesforce's own internal success and leadership to inspire my customers. - There is a sense of pride in working here; there are just so many cool things about this company, it's hard to list them all!","- The job itself is not ""easy."" Because the company is always innovating, always bringing new products and solutions to market, and always striving to stay at the forefront of the most pressing business challenges and trends facing our customers, there's constantly new information we need to learn in order to be trusted advisors to the clients we support. It's a lot to learn and stay enabled on; this is a company that thrives on fast-paced change. - Additionally, because our platform literally does everything, there are a variety of ""point solution"" competitors big and small that we have to constantly stay one step ahead of. Fortunately, Salesforce invests in product specialists, competitive intelligence teams, and other resources to support you. - You can definitely make a lot of money here if you are a top performer. That said, I get the sense that our base salaries are less competitive than comparable software sales roles at other high tech companies. That's a tradeoff to working at the best company though. Once you work here, you can get hired wherever. In fact, many people leave the company in order to get a MUCH more senior role somewhere else, and then leverage that to come back to Salesforce at much higher role and salary band. Staying at Salesforce might mean that your upward mobility is slower.",4 people found this review helpful

(Note that it wasn't all rosy, Salesforce also chose to do a round of layoffs during the pandemic, even though they were experiencing a record quarter, which caused a lot of controversy.) For as large of a company as Salesforce is, it is reasonably transparent. Employees have access to executive leadership, and have opportunities to ask them tough questions, such as regarding the layoffs they chose to do during the pandemic.","There is a lot of pride in Salesforce's culture, which can often feel a bit cult-like. I joined Salesforce through an acquisition, and the leaders at the acquired company seemed much more used to tough questions than leaders that I observed at Salesforce.

We are forced to baby REWS leadership like royalty to ""show off our hospitality skills"" but don't give the same treatment to even our most exclusive customers. I'm talking Starbucks three times a day with multiple drink options, extravagant catering setups with ridiculous dietary restrictions/preferences, gifts in the hundreds and hundreds of dollars for each exec for each visit, flowers and local fare being supplied in their hotel rooms, etc. These folks live like rockstars on the road. When COVID first started, we had front desk personnel crying because they were forced to stay at the desk. This same org was the first forced to come back into the office. Guidelines were set that everyone were to come back, no exceptions. Yet, we were finding out that exceptions were being made in other offices (unfair). The REWS leadership outwardly encourages employees to look for jobs outside of the org because, although they won't say it, there is no opportunity within it. When promotions or openings upward come available, they are given to those outside the company. The REWS team is the lowest paid org in the company and is treated like a cog in the machine. Very few people feel empowered to advocate for themselves or their teams. I can't remember the last time my team had a team-building, let alone a team-wide meeting. Managers only care about making sure they are seen in a good light for execs.",4 people found this review helpful

One of the most challenging things with any new job is getting ramped up to perform to the best of your abilities. Salesforce has blown away any preconceived notions I had of what an onboarding experience should be like. From providing me a coach during the interview process to that I am presenting the best version of myself and my skill set to an thoughtfully laid out onboard plan. I do understand that I may have a different experience than others because each department also controls a large portion of onboarding. However, I don't know of another company that spends 3-6 months ramping you in all the relevant areas you need to be successful at your job. Afterall, my success is ultimately the company's success. Additionally, I was paired with both a mentor who had been in the job for some time (12+ months) and a buddy who was only a few months ahead of me and can still remember all the struggles and challenges.","In regards to the onboarding experience, I have absolutely none.

That being said, if you're in Sales at Salesforce, you are fuelling the rocketship growth and that isn't always the most enjoyable experience. Let's start with the good: Great benefits, mostly great products, the pay is competitive (although reps are leaving for better pay more frequently), there is plenty of company culture kool-aid, and you can make pretty good commissions if you hit accelerators with the right accounts. Salesforce looks good on a resume, and if you don't like where you land at first, there is plenty of lateral flexibility within the company.","The not-so-great: Salesforce is focused on growth and that means squeezing every penny out of its customers. To do this, they put a lot of sales reps into small territories. Sales reps are tasked with selling with big quotas and small territories. On the aggregate, Salesforce does well but individually it is becoming more and more difficult to hit quota. Less than 30% of Account Executives (AEs) actually hit their number if that tells you anything. Further, the resources around AEs internally are becoming more of an obstacle than a benefit. The hardest part of this job is getting others internally to do their jobs. If you raise your concerns, someone will hear you and then nothing will get done. You will just be making excuses. There are a lot of great sales professionals at Salesforce. However, with smaller territories, the good AEs are leaving. The newbies who are still learning are the ones trying to sell to customers. Customers complain about the constant churn of account teams. One of the top complaints is employee burnout and nothing seems to be done about it.",7 people found this review helpful

I do feel that this is the first time in my career that my skills are accurately rated. I am given the opportunity to as they say ""level up"" with very detailed one on ones. This model only works for those who want to be better engineers and customer service agents. I never feel as if my caseload is too much. in fact, I have the free time to help my team reach resolutions and educate myself on my product. I really hope to retire here Before this, I owned my own business, and before that, I was a contract IT.

4007,583,"Amazing experience, fantastic company","Jun 6, 2022 - Lead Member of Technical Staff in San Francisco, CA",5.0,"Salesforce has a really solid business model, with a subscription-based approach to software that was revolutionary when it was first introduced 23 years ago. This subscription-based approach means that ongoing revenue can be relied on, for all customers that remain with the company. Since the attrition, or the loss of customers, is very low, this means that the cash flow for this business is very reliable and predictable over the long term. The company really strives to gain the trust and to ensure that customers are successful. These happy customers then become highly referenceable, and recommend our solution for others. Our product has become such a vital part of their business that it is also very sticky over the long term. As our company continues to acquire new capabilities, our solution becomes even more enticing and relevant, since we can address and integrate a broad cross-section of the needs of each of our customers (Marketing, Sales, Commerce, Service, Analytics). We deliver a comprehensive enterprise software solution, which is cohesive and integrated in ways that no other company can provide. In addition to this, we constantly think of ways to innovate and make our customers lives easier. We are able to digitize and improve the efficiency of a broad cross-section of enterprises out there who do not focus on digital solutions as their core business. All of these factors together represent a very strong opportunity for continued growth of this business. Salesforce has also been executing really well on surmounting many of the more difficult technical challenges that they faced due to the fact that the product is based on legacy code. There is technical debt related to the database, also there is a major migration underway to move to the public cloud. The company has executed incredibly well on these and many other challenges internally. The culture is incomparable. The leadership of the company have a genuine concern for each employee, and a real investment in doing the right thing for the community. The company takes a leading role in helping to champion initiatives that address homelessness and environmental issues for example. We also are really committed to the success of all of our stakeholders, including employees, customers, partners, communities, and all of the trailblazers who form the broader salesforce community. The ecosystem of administrators, architects and developers who are part of our space has continued to grow, and the company is also really proactive in helping to develop the skills of those people that might be interested in growing a career with our products.","There are not many downsides. The culture is really open and accepting. They are very accommodating to the needs of their employees, and they earn a significant degree of loyalty in return. Because this is such a great company, many people are willing to go the extra mile to keep this good thing going. There may be some mild challenges in terms of managing the culture internally, and ensuring that every group feels included, and part of the Salesforce family. Still, our leader ship clearly spends a lot of time focusing on the correct approach here, and ensuring that there are enough opportunities for people to connect with like minded coworkers, and to ensure that they are recognized and appreciated.",Be the first to find this review helpful

4084,664,Toxic Sales Culture,,3.0,"Salesforce is an incredibly reputable company to work for. It really is the best resume booster you could ask for that sets you up to be recruited by almost every company. The benefits are top notch- healthcare, ESPP, wellness stipend, and discounts at a variety of different companies. The offices are absolutely beautiful and an impressive place to take friends and family. I have heard that most departments are really great to work for, but be VERY careful to do your due diligence in figuring out which ones those are.","Underneath its grandiose, towering presence and pristine public reputation, lies a dark reality in the sales organization. I could never recommend a career in sales at Salesforce for these reasons: Compensation: Salesforce's base and OTE's are well under the market rate for Account Executives. On top of that, you are punished financially for being promoted within the company, and will receive a base/OTE that is 10-20k lower than external hires. Due to this, there is incredibly high turnover, as long term Salesforce sales employees bounce to other companies to receive proper compensation and many of the sales teams are constantly dominated by new hires. Territories are created in a way in which only about 20% of reps will hit their annual number so base your expected income on your base rate and how comfortable you would be living off of that number. Customer treatment: Salesforce redistributes territories every fiscal year, meaning customers are given a new Account Executive every year. This leads to extreme frustration and oftentimes, customers being sold solutions that they don't necessarily need. Expect to be dealing with many angry customers during the first part of the fiscal year, and cleaning up the mess created by the previous AE. Management: From my experience, I have had some of the most micromanaging and condescending bosses of my career at Salesforce. Even though I am a remote employee, I constantly feel as if my boss is looking over my shoulder through the constant Slack messages and tracking of my daily activity (call/email volume). The worst part is the culture of toxic positivity. Never admit that you are struggling either with work or in your personal life, as that will be used against you in one way or another. Favoritism is rampant and is gifted to those who go out of their way to express immense gratitude, compliment their boss, and NEVER admit frustrations, even if valid. Sorry, but I'm too old to act like a corporate robot monkey. Career mobility: As I mentioned above, in the sales organization, your pay will hardly change as you go up-market. Switching into other departments is nearly impossible as you must seek VP level approvals, navigate the lousy internal recruiting teams, and build up a case as to why you are more valuable than external hires. This is why there are so many Salesforce boomerangs... Ultimately, I had really high hopes for the Sales Organization at Salesforce, but was super disappointed by my experience. I understand that not every experience will be the same, but I think it is important to look past the facade.",10 people found this review helpful

Several coworkers described experiences of being horribly berated by hatchet folks in HR based on ""complaints"" that HR would not clarify or explain. They described being pulled onto phone calls and told they have to ""apologize for what you did"", and when asked what they were talking about, would be told ""it's impossible that you don't know what we're talking about and if you don't then it's even worse than we thought."" Some have hypothesized this is how Salesforce rattles employees they, for whatever reason, decide they want to leave ( inside scoop indicates this is another maneuver by some VPs to create ""opportunities"" to shape an org the way they want when they get key folks to self-select out) but have no reason to push them out or worse yet, the employees were actually considered high performing by prior managers. I highly recommend anyone considering Salesforce to stay away unless it is the best you can get because its a huge company, if you get on the wrong side of just about anyone it could get really bad for you and there is nothing you can do.",24 people found this review helpful

I'm the only black person on my team, and even on our larger 30 person team, there are only 3 people of Asian descent (which is nuts considering tech demographics overall), everyone else is white or white-passing, and I don't see that changing anytime soon. There has been a lot of marketing recently about Salesforce meeting its 50% underrepresented goal a year early, but that number includes all women, and if it didn't they'd never meet their goal. A lot of middle managers are not interested in diversity and definitely not inclusion. Even if you're hired here as a black employee, you won't be treated equally and people will question your experience and abilities constantly. It's demoralizing, and it explains why retention is so low. I wouldn't recommend working here unless you have a bigger goal in mind for what you want to do next.",15 people found this review helpful

4366,970,"Not the best, not the worst. Not a place for introverts","Dec 8, 2021 - Solution Engineer",3.0,Pay and benefits are good.,"Salesforce is better at buying outside talent than it is at developing its own people which is why there are so many boomerang employees. People leave to get the experience they need to go to the next role they want. There are no formal performance reviews meaning being promoted to your next role is very subjective depending on whether or not your leadership team likes you. Additionally, for the all the talk about showing up to work and embracing your authentic self, at the end of the day all anyone cares about is how you show up on a dashboard which incentives people to log things they did not do sometimes to an absurd degree like someone logging that they worked 70 hours a week every week for a quarter and then getting an award for most hours logged. Relatedly there is a huge emphasis placed on managing your personal brand. If you come from a cultural background where you are taught to do your best work day after day and expect that to be noticed in merit of itself, you will be disappointed working here at least in the sales organization. You have to have the desire to talk about yourself a lot and be a self promoter. Lastly, I want to share something I personally observed while working here. In my first sales team which was predominantly white, we had one female person of color on the team. She was exceptionally hard working, eager to learn, and dedicated to her job. Management and her colleagues did not support her in the way that was needed for her to reach her full potential. Moreover I believe they made work difficult for her in an effort to push her out of the organization. I never understood why. Maybe she didn't fit a type that her team was looking for. She later left to join another company where she is, unsurprising to me, doing very well. I would have thought that retaining and supporting talented employees of all backgrounds would be a priority but especially employees of color given how much Salesforce as a company talks about diversifying its workforce.",8 people found this review helpful

4389,994,What a disappointment...,,3.0,- Benefits are top notch - Perks in the tower and holiday party are impressive - Sales tactics and strategies are great for growth even as an experienced rep - You’ll meet very talented sales rep with a wide variance of styles -ESPP - generous maternity/paternity leave. Although this will affect your likelihood of be promoted,"I came into Salesforce like every rep, excited and eager to get my “MBA” in sales. Working here you’ll have to be prepared to give up everything just to stay afloat. In the first year you will most likely be given a terrible territory and what you do with it will decide your future here. Things you will need to juggle effortlessly or will lead you down the road of being let go are: - Activity- lots of calls. People who fib numbers here are celebrated by leadership but frowned upon by reps - Opp rigor- the amount of fields you will need to update are mind numbing - Pipeline- with a terrible territory be prepared to pipe aspirational pipeline that will be highly scrutinized - Prep meetings- there are endless prep meetings before calls. Due to schedules each person involved will require a prep meeting, leaving your day with little time for anything else. - Team selling- be prepared to sell with folks much junior than you and not held to as high of standards. If the deal falls through, it’s on you. There are a few coprimes that are skilled sales reps - Your “brand”- It’s important to maintain appearances, even on bad days. Your brand is determined by how involved you are in diversity, volunteer work, and leading the team, which requires tenure. -Manager 1:1’s- these are a trap to look out for. Salesforce preaches trust as one of it pillars, but beware that everything said in those meetings will be used against you when they have soured on you - Time management- working a 12 hr day is table stakes. There are endless distractions you will need to navigate and make hard decisions on “brand”/ appearance maintenance vs selling The work/life balance is very heavy on the work side. The exec team repeatedly say their biggest regrets are not spending enough time with family. This will never change if they don’t take it serious. There is a lot you can learn here but at the expense of your self confidence as some managers make you feel worthless when your awful territory isn’t performing. If that isn’t enough to make you steer clear, the pay is very low and less than 20% of reps hit their annual numbers The “Ohana” culture is a mirage. There is nothing remotely familial about the culture. It is an ultra competitive pressure cooker. I just had such higher hopes for my experience left disappointed...",431 people found this review helpful

4425,1030,Growth by Acquisition has killed the old Salesforce,,2.0,There are lots of smart and well-meaning people at Salesforce. Many non-sales do try and reflect the company values. Benefits are good (though not crazy) for a large tech company. New hires make a lot of money. Company has made a real effort to diversify and give women especially opportunities to move up (less so minorities). There are still a good number of old-time employees who genuinely care about the company and its values.,"As someone whose been with the company many years, it has transitioned from a smaller, agile, product-focused company to a Marketing and Sales holding company that does little or no product development. Nearly every major product announcement over the last few years featured huge fanfare, but resulted in the product dying a quiet end within 2 years. Pretty much every major product announcement now is just a Marketing 're-alignment', rebranding existing products, not actually developing anything new. All innovation is bought, not developed internally, and there is little sign that the various acquisitions (Mule, Tableau, Slack) are actually creating a 2+2=5 effect. It really feels like a bunch of independent companies that are owned by the same conglomerate. The focus on growth by acquisition also means very limited growth opportunities internally since the existing products aren't really growing or innovating significantly, it isn't creating new positions. A new, related phenomenon is that in order to retain talent, many low-to-middle managers are getting 'promotions in place', i.e. they are getting a bigger title and more money without additional responsibility because their orgs aren't growing. So you see lots of VPs with only two directs who are also VPs, creating lots of unnecessary layers of management who all feel they have to micromanage those below them in order to show they are 'adding value'. This lack of organic growth means a lot of people are attritting because they don't see any real career path. Career development isn't a focus beyond the first line of management. After that its all operations, process and programs. Manager success is evaluated on how many programs did you develop and market, not how many employees did you develop or how productive and happy is your team. Another issue is the split between the company image and Sales. While I do think a lot of product and engineering people do really believe in the company values, remember, this is a company founded by a Sales Guy. There is a very cutthroat sales mentality inherited from Oracle that often sees sales reps and leaders blatantly ignore values like trust, equality and customer success in order to hit their quarterly number. Sales is really the #1 value. The large and not rationalized product stack means that often sales reps are pitted against each other because they have overlapping products, and the result can be the customer gets the product of the better rep, not the product they need. Many products are 'zombie' products with no future product development and virtually no support staff, but because there are reps with quota on them, they are still being sold despite the fact that the customer will likely attrit in a couple of years once they realize they've been sold a lemon. Turnover in the Sales org also means a lot of inexperienced account execs who have zero understanding of the products or the company culture but are still being put on big accounts. Over and over you'll hear how solutions teams are the most vital part of the sales organization, but every award, spiff or shoutout goes to the sales rep. You'll hear about some amazing demo that sold the deal but the only names you will here are 5 different reps/AEs, like they did all the work themselves. They'll pat themselves on the back, go off to sales club and collect a massive commission and the SE will get back to work. Another thing most new employees won't notice at first because they just got their nice offer package, is that Salesforce hires at much higher dollar amount than it pays existing employees. Pretty much every new hire will make a LOT more than everyone else on a team. It's joked repeatedly that if you want a raise or promotion, your best option is to leave the company and get re-hired in a year. Stock is incredibly stingy. Unlike most tech companies that do yearly refreshes, you will be lucky to get new RSUs every 3-4 years, even for very top performers. Many relatively senior employees (15+ years overall experience, 4+ with company) have NO stock. A team of 10 might get 2-3 stock refreshes in a year. This is the #1 retention tool, and yet Salesforce consistently lags behind all competitors here. A lot of lip-service is given to the 'giving back' part of the company. When I joined this was for real. You got a week of VTO time, and if you used all that you'd get a sizeable grant to give to a charity of your choice. They removed the grants a few years ago without making any real announcement. The VTO time is still there but if you are above a certain level, you are on 'unlimited' PTO (which means you can take what you want, but only if your manager is cool AND you don't feel guilty about taking off during whatever crisis is currently happening). This makes the VTO time meaningless, since it just gets blurred in with PTO and sick leave.",2 people found this review helpful

Salesforce looks good on a resume, and if you don't like where you land at first, there is plenty of lateral flexibility within the company.","The not-so-great: Salesforce is focused on growth and that means squeezing every penny out of its customers. To do this, they put a lot of sales reps into small territories. Sales reps are tasked with selling with big quotas and small territories. On the aggregate, Salesforce does well but individually it is becoming more and more difficult to hit quota. Less than 30% of Account Executives (AEs) actually hit their number if that tells you anything. Further, the resources around AEs internally are becoming more of an obstacle than a benefit. The hardest part of this job is getting others internally to do their jobs. If you raise your concerns, someone will hear you and then nothing will get done. You will just be making excuses. There are a lot of great sales professionals at Salesforce. However, with smaller territories, the good AEs are leaving. The newbies who are still learning are the ones trying to sell to customers. Customers complain about the constant churn of account teams. One of the top complaints is employee burnout and nothing seems to be done about it.",7 people found this review helpful

Things are never expected in a timely manner. -Goals are a joke.

Unfortunately for some individuals, this means their time in Sales Development is extremely extended due to external factors such industry pressures, geography and AE/BDR alignment. A little more focus on a combination of the two and finding the right balance between numerical metrics and knowledgable skills & know-how needs to be recognised/implemented. - Exposure really only to sales vs. other business units.

You are encouraged to keep a balance but that's not always possible.","- Sometimes unrealistic sales / business management expectations from product resulting in oversells, it's a solid product but there's a lot of work needed to get to a setup that will do well on the enterprise scale. Smaller setups can work but if you are looking for the big benefits it requires time investment. - The 'family feel' push internally. This is really nice when you are newly immersed in it but you also need to be wary of assuming it's like a perfect family. Families have fights, internal squabbles and sometimes break apart so always look after your own future don't expect that completely from the company. - Steep learning curve if you've never worked on Salesforce product(s) before but there is lots of help there.

4633,162,"Honestly, great place to work at",,5.0,"I joined Salesforce Singapore as my first job fresh out of university, and truthfully, it's really the people that make this place an amazing place to work at. Different teams will have different ways of working for sure (dependent on the manager), but overall I find colleagues here willing to share their time and expertise. Even as a junior member of the company, I was never made to feel afraid or hesitant in approaching a more senior colleague for advice. There is a lot of trust in my team, which has been especially invaluable in this whole work-from-home situation. The autonomy and flexibility granted in my role is also surprising, but practical I suppose – considering how large the company is growing, it's difficult for a manager to micro-manage the activities of every single team member. The remuneration package is fair (not top-of-market however) and comes with lots of benefits. Most importantly, managers in Salesforce are super supportive about lateral movements within the organization, and outside of it. Telling your manager 'I would like to seek a new challenge this year' is not taboo here. I've lost count of the number of colleagues who have changed roles over the past 2 years I've been here.","Change happens constantly, and sometimes it's uncomfortable, or jarring, even. You're not suited for Salesforce if you're looking for a cushy role where you can just 'settle in' and relax. The company is always evolving, and you have to be adaptable to go along with it. A large company also means that increasingly, more operational processes have been installed. Is it a pain? Yes, sometimes. But is it bearable in the grand scheme of things? Also yes.",1 person found this review helpful

4651,2,Best company I’ve worked for!,,5.0,"- As a Solution Engineer, pay is excellent. Bonuses/commissions are for the most part guaranteed especially starting with FY19. Seniors and below get overtime! - 401k match up to $5k - Charity Donation match up to $5k - Fairly priced health insurance with premium options included for dental and eye - 13 holidays a year (includes 4 floating)! - 7 days of Volunteer Time Off - 100 a month for health and fitness subsidy - lots of free swag and giveaway gifts Salesforce is a great corporate citizen with their 1-1-1 pledge. They really do care about helping the community and equality for all. I’m truly proud to work for a great company. Being an SE out of San Francisco, we get the perks of having HQ with the amazing building amenities, cafes, snacks, fitness classes, access to product teams and leadership, technology kiosks, and conferences and marketing events such as Dreamforce, TrailheaDX, summits, and kickoffs. Although it may vary by team when being out of HQ, we still get the flexibility to work remotely which is nice since the SE role can be very demanding. The role continues to challenge me and provide tremendous growth opportunities. In this role I get opportunities to continue to learn new products almost every six months and get certified, improve my public speaking skills, and network with executives from all the customers I work with. I get the perks of traveling (and also get paid for it since I’m hourly) which is different than consulting travel because it’s 2-3 trips a month usually for 1-3 days and mostly localized to the west coast.","- As an SE, we’re often times spread very thin. In addition to pre-sales, we provide booth duty (marketing) and enablement (post sales) support. This leaves us no time to get the real work done, so we use nights and weekends to build and solution. - Marketing is usually 6 months - 1 year ahead of the products themselves. - Our customers love Salesforce but I spend most of my time education customers because they are confused on the products we offer. Putting Einstein and Lightning in front of every product confuses the crap out of everyone including internal employees - 3 weeks vacation for non exempt employees could be better - I often find that in order to use my VTO, I’m working overtime, because my work still needs to get done even if I’m doing volunteer work - Way too many all hands meetings. - Administrative overhead in general is extremely time consuming: time and expense reporting, activities entry, DCs, and administrative quip docs. - Turnover with our AE counterparts can impede on our ability to sell",10 people found this review helpful

If you happen to become apart of one of these products and teams, it's extremely difficult to get out of and Salesforce takes years to fire individuals that desperately need to be removed from the company. Management says that their hands are tied with Employee Success and Employee Success drags their feet, causing teams and clients to suffer dramatically.

Even if you hit quota, which by the way barely happens. Please, please, please, don’t believe the hype. Less than 20 % of the people hit quota. I think in GRB it’s less than 10% for 2017. Regardless it’s a joke. I’ve worked at other tech companies and I’ve never seem anything so pathetic. *terrible middle management, I mean terrible. Keep in mind this review is coming from someone who was cosidered realtively succssful, and still think this place is a joke. Anyways, I digress.... Middle management for the most part is made up of people who lack leadership skills, talent, experience. It’s actually joke. It’s like a weird cesspool of account executives being promoted to management. One day theyre your peer, the next day, they’re your superior. Not saying they’re racist or anything, but holy hell, talk about 95% Caucasians Being promoted into these roles. Overall, management (based on my experience, observations, talking to peers,etc) literally brings NO value. They just sit at their computer and run reports, show up late to customer meetings, sit awkwardly/quietly in a conference room during a customer call, but during 1on1s (these are also frequent, redundant, waste of time), they offer to sit in on calls/meetings as if They are providing value. If you’re one of the unfortunate suckers/victims to work for Salesforce please please please understand, your entire success, compensation, will be 99% based on the territory handed to you. That’s it point blank. All the other BS, is Just that BS. Run a few reports and you’ll see the top performs get most of their ACV from organic aka gimmes or flips aka warm leads handed to them by the inside biz dev team. Team. Yes, working hard and doing everything the right way (by the book) will give you a very slight edge, but if you’re not handed a fruitful territory you WILL NOT hit quota or make money. Pleeeeasse, please take this as the truth. Again, I was a top 10-20% person, and I’m leaving this review. I could go on and on, but I’ll end it with this. If you’re an experienced sales professional, do NOT work here. You will regret it and regret it fast. If you’re a developer/coder then Salesforce might be a legit landing spot, otherwise look elsewhere.",58 people found this review helpful

4730,81,"A great place to work, but not without its challenges","Feb 9, 2018 - Software Engineer in Indianapolis, IN",5.0,"- Benefits here are incredible. Bonus, stock options (both RSUs and ESPP), generous 401k policy, plenty of PTO, 3 months of paternal leave (even more for mothers), sit/stand desks, free snacks / drinks, free food pretty often - Work/life balance is not perfect but a big step above other companies I have worked for. Your free time is for the most part respected (emergencies non-withstanding) and in my experience no one feels judged for using their PTO or VTO. - Many companies talk the talk in terms of diversity, but Salesforce walks the walk. They famously fought discriminatory laws in Indianapolis and unilaterally gave raises to ensure female employees were paid at the same rate as their male counterparts (without forcing pay cuts on anyone). They also strive to have a diverse board of directors, though I think this still needs work. - All full-time employees receive 7 paid days off (in addition to normal PTO) to pursue volunteer opportunities - and, again, this is actively encouraged. - Most managers do not have a ton of direct reports, meaning you can build a good relationship with your manager. - Career changes are not only permitted but encouraged. Some areas of the company have annual job fairs for lateral moves if you are not happy. In my case, my manager started to talk with me about where I want my career to go before I had even started to consider it. - Right now, great job security as the company is growing like crazy - which is great if you're used to consulting work.","- Most of the Pros are company-wide things, but your experience may vary depending on where you work. It is a large company and different areas do things differently. - A ton of middle management and time spent in meetings. - While it is great to be a part of a global company, there are challenges involved in working at a remote location (i.e. not in San Francisco). We are often not a priority when SF is involved, so factoring in the time difference, you can be waiting day(s) to get issues resolved. - As with many companies of this size, a lot of ""hurry up and wait."" Get your work done according to a deadline, but watch it sit due to bureaucracy or changing priorities. - Salesforce isn't immune to a lot of the issues that plague software engineers everywhere.

Predatory behavior in meetings. Only a white can do such a thing and not face any consequences because trust is a right for the whites and for colored it is a loosely hanging privilege which might be lost anytime and needs to constantly work on earning the privilege. I saw people even at Sr.Director level (who was colored) just leaving the meeting not knowing what to say or do. Eventually that Sr.Director (who was top notch) left the team in the name of personal reasons. Believe it or not, those whites even got promotions and MVP awards. - Nepotism is prevalent. I was fully surprised by the way an engineering lead was lifted up to a top level leadership level so quickly (< 3 months since joining) without producing any good results. He was referred by another well positioned person in the team. The guy lacked humanity and was untrustworthy. He was aggressive, inconsistent, unresponsive, over-confident and was stepping on others toes a lot. Even providing feedback in the feedback app with facts to stop doing such things didn't help. - Absolutely no transparency in promotions. People who did great things didn't get promoted and they left. I was a founding engineer who worked for closely 2 years. Many of the peer reviews were extremely positive. I was involved in some of the top level architecture meetings, was openly stated in those meetings that this is a really critical piece so i was needed to do it and ultimately got the job done from me, only to let a white take over the project once it was done and I saw others getting promoted who built on top of the work I had done. My manager didn't say any bad things in our 1:1s, he promoted others, resigned and just before leaving he talked to me for a minute over a phone call and we never met. I was the biggest fool to trust these people. - I was low balled on the pay and the recruiter lied to me that salesforce doesn't do any sign on bonus and negotiations. - Extremely operations heavy culture. Once a product is built and released to the customers, the pace at which things move is unbelievably slow. Leadership kills innovations, condescends on engineers who innovated and worked hard to build the product and makes everything operations centric.",10 people found this review helpful

Normally in sales one faces a 3 EOQ's and one EOY push. At salesforce, you face 11 EOQ's and one EOY push. Basically, every month is like a quarter end. Territories are not intentionally unbalanced, but it does happen. A lot of the success you may or may not experience will be a result of a great or poor territory. Some managers understand this and work with you to maximize your results until the next year when things can be re-balanced, others are quick to terminate. As a result of this territory lottery, success and failure can come quickly.

4749,100,Designers can do more meaningful work elsewhere,"Jan 25, 2018 - Product Designer in San Francisco, CA",2.0,"Core benefits are good. Healthcare options seem competitive and are always looking to make better. The people you meet won’t all be so difficult. You’ll get the opportunity to volunteer and do some real good for someone else. I noticed if you have a family or are looking to start one, that the work life balance is probably your best benefit. However, such a good balance can often times appear to make individuals seem lazy and have little to no motivation to work quickly. That in turn has a trickle down effect to the rest of the teams who want to work quickly and build product.","I joined a smaller company Salesforce owned that was eventually swallowed whole by the larger Salesforce company, and we were fully integrated into one of the major clouds. Things were very pleasant and work was interesting before the roll over into Salesforce. However, once my team joined the larger company, is when things took a turn unfortunately. I believe things took a turn because Salesforce is built on top down management. The bigger the title the bigger the voice you’ll have. People use their title as weight when making decisions. The overall design culture is perceived as a second thought to a lot of teams. Due in part that your engineers can and will make decisions for you based on seniority. Not all, but most teams have a hard time getting their engineers to innovate and work with them. This behavior also comes from the previously mentioned work life balance. Anything that looks like it may take an extra hour, will fall off your design quickly. Be carful of Kool-aid drinking. They use the term “Ohana”, family in Hawaiian culture (which is also cultural appropriation) to describe their own internal company culture. The management team uses this type of thinking to determine if your a team player or not. The type of “family” culture they perpetuate creates a lot of passive aggressive behavior. Add the behavioral issues onto the top down management, and you have a recipe for ladder climbing, favoritism, yes men, and brown nosing. The executive running the design on my cloud showed incredible bias and fueled this behavior. As well as some very questionable hiring and promotional practices. I felt their behavior was highly unethical, and they felt no remorse for their actions. The product you build at Salesforce will only ship 3 times a year. That’s if it ships at all. The pace is incredibly slow moving. I can not stress that enough. Changing an icon can literally take 9 months. This can make it hard to retain the talent that comes from a start up environment. Which Salesforce is in desperate need of. The salary is adequate at best for most designers. I found out later that I actually made much more coming from a different company and rolling into Salesforce. RSU’s are some of the lowest you’ll be awarded in the tech industry for a company this size. Most director level people get any meaningful stock refresher. Like I mentioned, top down management. I negotiated cash over RSU’s (which made my offer compelling). While a lot of what I wrote can seems very negative, not everyone I had the chance to work with made me feel this way. I did have the opportunity to meet “some” talented designers and engineers. I had the opportunity to volunteer and help others. The work I was doing at the time had impact up to certain point and I did learn a thing or two while at Salesforce. TL;DR: Top down management creates passive aggressive behavior. Slow moving development time, Salesforce only ships 3 times a year. Design is a second thought for most teams (but not all). Base salary is average, not competitive. RSU’s for a company this size are some of the worst in the industry.",15 people found this review helpful

Smart developers with good problem solving skills. Great career growth opportunities. Planning of work is better than most other companies that I have come across.,"Hybrid Engineering has pros and cons. However, in Indy, the strategy for hybrid transition is causing a significant loss in engineering productivity. First, Pros: 1.) Hybrid engineering has brought more focus on using contemporary tools for automated testing. 2.) This helps in improving system reliability and make developers better at their jobs since testing is not considered an afterthought anymore. 3.) Huge investment in automated testing upfront is a good overall strategy that will help in system scalability and reduce buggy software releases. Cons: 1.) The idea for depending more on automated testing than on manual testing has translated into demanding all manual / semi manual qa testers to learn how to code. 2.) This is the strategy that has not panned out at all. While, the self help tools like online courses, mentoring resources and in-team guidance have been a proactive ongoing effort, this approach is taking massive hits on productivity for developers as well as for testers all around. 3.) You can find developers on any given day spending quite a bit of time (hours at times) going over basic step by step process (over and over again) with the testers to resolve minority non-mission critical bugs. 4.) Testers, especially who are not from a programming background / havent coded in a while, are overwhelmed and stressed out about the tickets they have to complete each sprint. 5.) For a company that champions engineering productivity and no interruption time for developers, developers are spending less time on quality features/innovative/disruptive work and more time getting bogged down by the process+manual testing+ incremental work . Dont get me wrong, the notion of ohana is embedded deep in the organization and engineers are glad to help their peers anytime.

Growing to fast and not able to keep up with overall growth. Seeing lots and lots of angry current customers... 8/10 if you don't have 5-6+ years of inside/outside sales experience, you will only be considered for an SDR or BDR role. This could be fine, but the role should incorporate more closing of business if you are basically expecting people to take a demotion for the role and not articulating the position clearly (this could just be an issue with my office though). If you are on the BDR team you can be the hardest working person and still not hit your number because of how your quota is attained. Your manager will ""help you"" come up with ""strategic plans"" to hit your number (basically just tell you to make more calls/set meetings) but it doesn't matter because if you AEs refuse the meetings, don't feel like moving them to a stage 2 (everyone perceives what this means differently), don't have time to take them until the next month, etc. then you are screwed. BDR management doesn't align with AE management at all. Therefore, they don't care about anything except their AEs closing deals (I don't blame them!), they are annoyed when BDR management comes complaining that their AEs aren't working with their BDR... This is just not a conducive business model and doesn't help growth initiatives. Not everyone is measured the same. You could be aligned 2-4 AEs or 10-15 AEs as a BDR. Either way, these people are expected to generate the same amount of ""stage 2"" opportunity. If you have 2 AEs that are busy, don't work in your office or don't have the ""need"" for a BDR to generate pipeline - then you have NO chance of hitting your quota. SDRs, BDRs and AE's are all expected to generate their own pipeline - which makes sense but it is causing people to compete with each other which takes away from making the customer #1 priority. This is especially bad since the Mulesoft migration... (from BDR POV) Although Salesforce always talks about endless internal growth opportunities, this is def not something that I have seen to be encouraged. You are pretty much forced to take the typical promotion track. BDR Management is way too pushy with BDRs setting new meetings and business, while this should be a significant responsibility, lots of customers get mislead, forgotten, or treated with poor customer service which eventually will backfire (I have already seen it backfire a few times!) As a BDR you could generate $5mil in the pipeline one month, but only have 2 stage two opptys on the board (you need around 6-8)...which means you will miss your quota. Others could have 6-8 opptys on the board which only adds up to $300k in pipe for the month, but they will hit quota.. Doesn't make sense.",14 people found this review helpful

Culture is another toss up depending on the RVP - they preach “Ohana” but in lots of cases it should be “nohana” - be VERY careful if you are looking at a job in one of the the coprime aka overlay AE divisions as it can be very toxic if your product set isn’t service cloud....be sure to really feel out your managers leadership style before you take one of these roles because there really are some brutally awful RVPs.

The company culture would have you believe that Security/Trust trumps everything. Development machines are tightly locked down, and access to new technologies requires a multi-level approval process that can take months. While Security teams claim to ""partner"" with engineering teams, they impose security restrictions without any input from engineering and require layers of ""evidence"" as to why a restriction should be lifted (we're talking simple things like installing Docker). I was once told that ""Powershell is banned, access to it is completely forbidden"". Furthermore, the company claims to be Agile and is anything but. This is typical for large companies with internal software teams, but frankly I expected more from a company like Salesforce. User stores and bugs are tied back to epics that are ""committed"" to specific releases. They require stories that tie back outlining the project from start to finish, and individual stories are broken down further into ""tasks"" that really just lead to a tedious ""check the box"" workflow for most projects. If for some reason the project doesn't make it in the committed epic, prepare to be asked by multiple layers of management as to why it was dropped/delayed. If you're a developer looking for a 9-5 gig with the best benefits in town and an easy-going atmosphere, this might be for you. If you're a developer that wants to work with newer technologies and create truly innovative solutions to existing problems, look elsewhere.

Financial remuneration is as good or better than any other company if you attain your quotas. Most coworkers are helpful and cheerful. It is a joy to work from any from any of the beautiful offices. Internal tools such as Concierge and Trailheads are great. Growth is encouraged. Most new employees are given 60 days or so to ramp up.,"First, It is very much the same old type of network. Don't be taken in by the facade of empowering women. It is just one step off Weinstein-like mentality (there is no harassment of that type but the mentality is ""women, know your place"".) What I specifically mean is this: men have a way of doing the Sales, R&D, IT, and programs like Ignite. Women have to scurry along and just make nice. You dare not speak up. Some small amount of benign questioning will be ""allowed"". If you really challenge the unproductive practices, a swarm of managers and their managers and their managers will put you on ""employee success"" plan. This goes on your HR records. Once it does, you cannot transfer, get promoted, get a letter to attend Business School or get a good reference to go to another company. A multitude of other good things you might have done and your hard work will go down the drain. It makes people suicidal. This culture does not understand that this job is food on our table. Second, many former Google, Facebook, Nvidia, Microsoft and 5 Agency employees are welcome if they just about have a pulse. Hence, high ranking executives will come one or two days to work; will not have full comprehension of client's current/future stages; treat all engineers as inferior; and publicly chide team members. Third, Veterans are hired in droves. Hiring is all they do. That is all. Then a handful of hyper-gamified, substance-less Trails are thrown at them along with a ""mentor"" program. Most new hires, especially veterans, struggle between not knowing how to navigate the million tools and the embarrassment of asking colleagues on how to do things. Fourth, Salesforce attracts prospective employees in with a seemingly high pay. But, a large part of that is commission or bonus. IT IS IMPOSSIBLE to attain quota or utilization. This is another way for managers to crack the .",43 people found this review helpful

4874,225,Want PTSD - Work for Salesforce,"Sep 9, 2019 - Senior Technical Program Manager",1.0,Plush office space Snacks Nice view from the upper floors,"Salesforce is the most toxic organization I have ever worked for, and I've worked for a lot of organizations as both an FTE, contractor, and consultant over the past two decades. Trying to pare down what I want to warn others of is difficult. I'll just bullet it out and you can decide what would wear you down, disrupt your sleep, and leave you paranoid, the most. - 1:1s with senior management where the most hateful things are said about your character, etc., and then afterward, the manager acts as though it never happened. -Pressure to give Salesforce a glowing Glassdoor rating after less than 30 days at the company when you do not know enough to provide an accurate review. - No written reviews, something called a 9 box where management provides their opinion of you and tells you it exists but then says you are never allowed to see it, per H/R. - If you want to apply for an internal position, you must have your manager's permission first. If you tell your manager you want to apply for the role and he/she does not want to lose you, he/she just says, no, you do not have my permission. Game over, you are going no where. - If you are allowed a desk (many have to submit to hoteling and never knowing where they will sit day to day), no personal plants, photos, or non SF toys allowed. They want a uniform look to the desks. -Forced volunteerism, if you do not log your 50 hour minimum of volunteer hours per year, you will be shamed at team meetings. Doesn't matter if you have kids, sick parents, 60 hour work week, whatever, you are expected to make the minimum. -No criticism of Benioff permitted. And don't ever say out loud that you found it disturbing to see a laying on of hands and someone praying over him as though he were a prophet at an internal company meeting. Management will quickly remind you that he is leading the 4th industrial revolution and he is the leading mind of our time. -If you are managing young hourly employees, be prepared to be instructed that you are to tell them they MUST go to team dinners, volunteer events, and SF ""fun"" activities but this is not work, so they don't get paid. If you push back, you will be reprimanded for ""not being Ohana."" - Teams are run by popularity. Backstabbing, shaming, and shunning are used to get the teams to stay quiet about how bad things are. People who speak out about behaviors, lack of professionalism, etc. are labeled, ""unOhana"" and told that they are not acting like family. - When you interview and you take a position, there is ZERO guarantee that the role you interviewed for and were hired for is the role you will be doing. The management opinion is to hire highly qualified people, they will be so grateful to be permitted to work at Salesforce, they will do whatever job we give them. I kid you not, you may have more than a decade of experience, be highly technical, have managed teams, and be hired for a technical role, then be told you are going to do data entry level work and you will be glad you are permitted to be at this company doing that. -If you are uncomfortable participating in some public events, e.g. parades, events, etc., and SF is participating in one, there is incredible pressure to spend your weekend in the parade or event. The expectation is that Salesforce and its needs come first. I cannot stress this enough, you are told that Salesforce is YOUR family and your family comes first. A lack of loyalty to the company will get penalized far more significantly and quicker than complete incompetence, maliciousness, or even harassment. Salesforce demands absolute devotion.",54 people found this review helpful

Weeks of training, setting up your computer, waiting for other people to give you access to resources you need, and finding out information about anything is tough. We use chatter and google docs to keep track of random information like where to get a company phone or what API to use for integration with such and such. But both resources are a conglomeration of obsolete and inapplicable information. While we do pride ourselves on having an open culture, it isn't necessarily a very exciting, friendly or personal culture. You're generally free to do what you like, but many (maybe most) teams don't go to lunch together and aren't friends with each other. They just have small talk and do what it takes to get the job done well. Since your team is who you're with all day and who you talk to most of the time, it's kind of important. I wish it was the other way around, where my team was wanted to talk too much and spend more time hanging out than I did. The employees are kind of old here, so it's just not what I'm used to I suppose.

I’ve seen lots of highly successful AEs come to Salesforce and leave after less then a year after being dealt TERRIBLE territories mostly due to lots of upset oversold customers with lots of shelfware. Also, lots of poor implementations due to prior AEs not insisting on customers bringing in business partners when they should have because they just wanted to close deals....Many customers who look good on paper aren’t buying anything for these reasons....in many cases hard work has nothing to do with hitting your number - if you don’t have good/satisfied install accounts in your territory (total toss up btw) there is no path to success whatsoever as decent net new logo deals are few and far between (in Mid Market) - the expectation at Salesforce is that you won’t hit your number - you’ve been warned... Culture is another toss up depending on the RVP - they preach “Ohana” but in lots of cases it should be “nohana” - be VERY careful if you are looking at a job in one of the the coprime aka overlay AE divisions as it can be very toxic if your product set isn’t service cloud....be sure to really feel out your managers leadership style before you take one of these roles because there really are some brutally awful RVPs.

The company offers quite a few perks, from free barista-served coffee to lavish holiday parties at which you might see flame throwers or magicians (depending on theme). PTO is good, not great, for newer employees (3 weeks), though another week and a half or so is given for volunteer work (VTO). The pay is good, with a 10% annual bonus (assuming your performance reviews are perfect). I always felt free to be myself and never felt that I had to change my behavior to fit in. Casual day is every day. There is no outdated mentality at Salesforce wherein employees can only be considered respectable if they are wearing a suit.","Marketing Cloud, at least, is still going through transition pains years after acquisition. Many processes have not worked out kinks yet, and it felt like San Francisco dictated to our office without taking into consideration our unique needs. During my time in Marketing Cloud Support, we were extremely under-staffed, with a discouragement of using overtime and yet we had to call every customer, every day, and provide them with a two-hour window during which we could call. I have been told that since I left rules have become even stricter. With tight SLAs, little overtime available, and a severe lack of staff, employees were extremely stressed and turnover became a real problem. We did not feel that the company cared whether the requirements of the job were impossible to perform in an 8-hour day. The team that existed when I left earlier this year looks nothing like the current team because of people feeling they had to leave to get out of the situation. Team leads and managers in Indianapolis were as supportive as they could be given the situation and pressure on them as well.

Visionary CEO Marc Benioff, created an idealistic culture where employees are paid to volunteer 50 hours a year, and the company matches their charitable donations up to $10K a year. At the company's San Francisco headquarters, employees have daily access to the best view on the West Coast, the 61st floor of Salesforce Tower. The workforce is generally smart, professional, and ethical. There are plenty of resources. Managers are on the whole receptive to new projects.","Because Salesforce is growing so fast – doubling its workforce and revenue over two years – many things get lost in the shuffle. Some teams have crushing workloads, while others are virtually forgotten. The prevailing infrastructure of the company is a parochial network of vice presidents operating independently. This leads to disconnection, and occasionally chaos. Teams duplicate work, work in contradictory directions, and compete pointlessly. Territoriality for budget and resources is rampant. There are no centralized checks and balances. If you have a bad or unethical warlord, you may be asked to do things that are counterproductive or even hurtful. The patchwork of fiefdoms across the company is so disconnected that many teams are unaware of similar teams within the company. Efforts to organize or connect strategies are met with resistance and sometimes hostility. A chief strategy officer with a team of connected project managers could address this, but many VPs don't want accountability. The result is work that doesn't rise above mediocrity. Salesforce is a great company comprised of dozens of mediocre companies. Those mediocre companies don't want to connect and be great because their leaders don't want to lose status. Once you see that you can't unsee it. Many workers grow cynical as a result.

5007,78,Salesforce Marketing Could is poorly managed and chaotic,"Feb 13, 2017 - Agency Temp in Indianapolis, IN",2.0,"I worked remotely for the marketing cloud division out of Indianapolis. The company treated me well, both in terms of compensation and the flexibility they allowed me to exercise when working from home.","Broken promises: I was assured when I came on-board that the job was a contract-to-hire, but after the initial contract period was over, I was extended on the same contract and told that no full-time would be available. I was also told upon my initial visit to the office that I'd be visiting the office in-person several times a year, but after 7 months, there is no repeat visit on the horizon, so I feel very disconnected from the team. The only thing we actually do is build a web app that helps people send out marketing e-mails. I was excited about being part of something big that sets the industry standard, but I eventually figured out that couldn't care less for the company's product. My manager was changed halfway through my contract to a person who is a great coder but who has virtually no management experience, and she had two modes: ignore me completely and tell me everything is great, or micromanage my work with a critical eye and tell me I am going too slow and I don't deserve to bill for a full week. It didn't seem like she was capable of paying attention in a way that was really supportive. The last complaint I have is that priority decisions were made in a very top-down way without an intelligent eye on the effectiveness of work that's being done. Lots of automation coverage was built around medium to low priority test cases that were decided arbitrarily, while outstanding known defects and other important things were ignored.",8 people found this review helpful
5008,79,Toxic work environment and culture,"Apr 27, 2017 - Anonymous Employee",2.0,- Marc Benioff is a great CEO - Building tallest new building on west coast - Training - Commitment to philanthropy 1:1:1 model - Good office location,"Management - Many Managers, Few Leaders - Moral is low. Few are making quota. Micro management is pervasive. Management wants to own all the deals and tell AE's what to do and how to do it. There is no trust in the AE's ability to drive a deal to close. Management attempts to drive rep behavior by fear and focusing too much on the volume of activity. There is a lack of focus on being out in territory vs volume of remote calls / meetings. Management needs to do a better job of using the app to reference next steps and activity. AE's are asked to repeat what is already in the app and often a waste of time and meetings. Quota Attainment and Resources - Very few people are hitting quota and throwing more bodies at the problem is not solving it. We are short of SE's and SE management. We have way too many co-primes units and need to dissolve the service cloud co-prime role. GB and Select comp plan is not aligned to a ""monthly cadence"" and only can make , few people are achieving quota and management is terrible. Management constantly complaining to reps about activity, expense reports or closed business. Monthly cadence for sales isn't aligned to the comp plan for GB and Select roles. A lot of politics. Limited Work Life Balance and Always on Call - We are not doctors or solving the world's most important problems. We are sales reps for a tech company. We should not be on call every night, weekend and on PTO. Reps are NOT encourage to take time away to re-energized and refocus. When reps try to take time off, they are getting daily emails from management. Managers Get Unlimited PTO / Reps Get Very Limited PTO - Managers not get unlimited PTO due to a policy change in April 2017 where Director level and above (management) get unlimited PTO, Meanwhile AE reps are limited to about 2 weeks of PTO and still filling out weekly time sheets! Everyone should be on the same policy - unlimited PTO. Credit on Deals - Another example of the politics and toxic culture is having another AE get credit and commission credit for a large deal they did not do any work on. This impacts the moral, work environment, and obviously commission. Management often overlooks doing the right thing and being inflexible.",8 people found this review helpful
5009,80,"Tech & Product Org - Great Work Environment, Poor on Diversity","Jun 1, 2017 - Product",3.0,"Salesforce pays well in salary/commission/equity, give employees a flexible and generally fun culture, provides a generally transparent work environment and is clearly at a growing, destination company with a visionary leader. The culture of volunteerism and giving back is in the fabric of the company and is something that is almost mandated that people do in their communities in ways that they think is best and fulfills their passion to give back. Salesforce's stand on many macro issues from LGBT rights in Indianapolis, Georgia and North Carolina to equal pay for women are highly laudable and amazing to feel you are a part of in some small way. Some of the leaders at Salesforce from Marc Benioff to many of his deputies are truly inspirational people and there is a sense that you are at times in a once in a lifetime role which does feel special","Diversity Being a white male is a much better chance of moving up and certainly moving up at a more rapid pace or getting to any VP+ role. The ranks of non caucasians across the board in senior roles is small and you can see that the diversity racial numbers are largely inflated by lower level employees. Certainly there has been strides in recent years for diversity and upward mobility for women but by and large this is just white women. Ultimately the saddest part to it is that while Salesforce hired a non white person to lead diversity, his role has largely been symbolic and for external macro political reasons. As tangible cases of diversity issues have arisen on an individual employee basis, invariably it has been the side of the tenured white Salesforce leader who has won the day. Being an employee of color is frustrating at Salesforce because over time things do become patronizing as you are told if you do A, B or C you will increase your chances of getting a reward or a promotion. Yet clearly others do none of the above and those same rewards come their way. Writing this may sound like sour grapes but ultimately the numbers don't lie with employee diversity numbers across the board in middle to senior roles as well as tenure to promotion ratios for whites vs. non whites. Salesforce is not alone in tech let alone the wider corporate culture with this issue. However it is a company that prides itself on being progressive here and it really is not when it comes to employees within the company. Diversity is not a PR headline as we so often seek, it is actually people's lives.",5 people found this review helpful

""Born cloud"" really does matter, and it shows in the growth of the business. With success comes excellent, top of market compensation, top-notch offices, great systems and support to do your job well.","Salesforce is surprisingly political, especially when you consider how the brand is fun and there's a genuine ""do good"" ethos of philanthropy at the company. Salesforce attracts high performers, which is great in many ways but also leads to a very ""type A"" aggressive, win-at-all-cost environment. Add on top of that the fact that Marc likes to make multiple bets and encourage internal competition (it's why there are two customer service products that sometimes directly compete, two salesforce automation products, etc.). So you end up with a workplace culture that, while exceedingly positive and gracious on the surface, is actually quite cut-throat and reliant on personal connections over merit. I saw multiple examples of mid-level managers making decisions based on what would most impress the boss over what was best for the company, let alone the customer. There's an obsession with BSOs (Big Shiny Objects) that cost a fortune and have little impact on the business but can be touted internally in presentations to leadership.",26 people found this review helpful

5056,127,The Star Rating Says it All,"Jan 17, 2015 - Anonymous Employee in Portland, OR",2.0,"1. The company does offer some great opportunity for upward movement, which is great for those who are looking to begin or enhance their careers. 2. The benefits are pretty good. 3. Within the workplace there are a lot of amenities that other employers do not, i.e. food, drinks (non-alcoholic), and the occasional catered event is nice too. But on the other hand, this is all fluff.","Unfortunately there are a lot more Cons then there are Pros, which is a reflection of the location I was at: 1. The Management in Technical Support could use some Management training. Call Center management is well known for creating drama, poor morale, and inconsistency within the workplace. 2. The Managers create a toxic environment by not caring about employee welfare and falsifying information to employees. The company prides itself in transparency, but it doesn't seem that, that is the case. 3. If your not based in the headquarters office, it is extremely difficult to move into a new position, especially when your Managers has little to no interest in helping you grow professionally. 4. Employees are not held to the same standard as their peers. If your Manager likes you, you can get away with whatever you want. If he/she doesn't like you, you should plan on finding a new job as they will lie to upper management. 5. Upon starting a position with Salesforce, do not expect training because you're not going to get it. They would rather have you slave away fixing their previous mistakes, rather than properly train you to be efficient and knowledgeable about the product. The ramping up process is an absolute joke and an insult! 6. There is not one Manager who can do your job. None of the Manager's know the Salesforce platform or have any technical aptitude. 7. It is easy to get burnt out. For example 10 of the 12 months of my employment has consisted of 50 hour work weeks, full of insane workloads and the pressure to maintain specific metrics. They will squeeze every last bit of sanity and work out of you and all you get in return is the Managers cooking breakfast for you, which is an insult. Not only can they not manage, but they're also terrible cooks as well. 8. There is a lot of self-serving people in Technical Support and on Account Management teams. Rather than being one united team, people only look out for themselves and will quickly step on your toes if it suits them. 9. Your peers may appear to be on your side and want to make positive change with you. But they will be quick to stab you in the back if it means they will get in trouble.. Major lack of ""testinal fortitude"". 10.The morale in the office is equivalent to a prison. 11. As a Manager you should leave personal opinions and judgments at the door. 12. You can be extremely lazy, but have a good attitude and you will be treated like a top tier employee. If your a top performer but have the occasional bad day due to the high work volume and terrible workplace environment, your career will not flourish. 13. Managers are never available. And when they are, if you have questions or concerns, it is a huge convenience for them. 14. The platform UI is straight out of 2005. Who uses i-Frames anymore? 15. There's a lack of tools and resources available to do our jobs and Management will tell you the resources are coming, but they never do. Of if you do get them, it is too little, too late. 16. The company has lost its vision.. Being innovative doesn't involve buying other platforms/software and integrating it into your own. It is creating the product on your own.",7 people found this review helpful

There is a good work-life balance. Where I ding them on the overall score is based on the Salt Lake City office.",Salesforce tends to acquire with little emphasis on actually integrating behind the scenes outside of the products - something exacerbated by them acquiring Demandware when the dust of Demandware acquiring Tomax hadn't yet settled. The Salt Lake City office has a very different vibe than other Demandware or Salesforce locations. There are some passive aggressive personalities in it due to some painfully obvious coddling by prior (and some present) management. Many hold job titles that are not at parity with industry guidelines and somehow think that they are 'special' when they wouldn't survive a month in that role elsewhere. People tend to withhold information whether it's dodging questions they know the answers to or refusing to document things because they view themselves as more valuable with secrets locked in their heads. For the technical professional who wants to come in and get things accomplished the SLC office culture will wear on you. It is the opposite of collaborative except for a few key people working hard to change the dynamic.,10 people found this review helpful

So much growth since I started with dot org three years ago, and lots of new people coming on board with the high growth!","New AEs or people considering coming to dot org – there is a caveat and buyer beware! It’s starting to feel like a sink-or-swim culture with so many new people coming onboard. I’ve been asked to work with numerous new AEs as they stepped into their role since fall/December of 2018. It’s become very clear that we are not taking the right steps to onboard them. New AEs are overwhelmed with the boundless options and tools we give them. Not to mention, for December hires, their RVPs were busy closing FY ’19 business, so our most vulnerable new hires were left to fend for themselves. Hopefully, they’ll get RVP support once FY ’20 kicks off. Bottom line: our intentions are good, but our execution fails them. It’s interesting that we constantly, almost self-righteously, talk about “the pace of Salesforce” as if it’s a badge of honor that only a few can achieve. Most new AEs coming into higher ed want to achieve and catch onto this pace right away. However, unfortunately we’re sabotaging their success by everything we throw at them (and again, often without RVP support). The enablement and RVP teams need to do better jobs of sequencing and blocking off the new hire content. Instead, we are throwing everything plus the kitchen sink at them – all at once – and expecting them to make sense of it all. No wonder I get panic-stricken phone calls and text messages at all hours of the day/night from rookies. Many RVPs are telling down their throats for answers, yet we haven’t paced their learning. In our current state of onboarding, I don’t know if even I could make it through this process given the “throw-it-all-at-them” approach we now take.",4 people found this review helpful

There are always snacks, free food, events, beer, etc. Management can be pretty understanding when life happens and you need to take time off to take care of something.","A few months ago, there was a large surge of hiring. Most of the hires came from a third party vendor that was closing. Some of the new hires from this location were previously denied applicants. I discovered that these new employees were being hired in Senior positions over me, making more money than me, and were even given relocation bonuses that I was told I could not have when I relocated in the previous year to work for this company. When I was first hired, the interview process seemed incredibly difficult to get through. Once they had seats to fill, it became a mad dash to find anyone with any Salesforce experience to fill the seats, and they seemed to do anything to get those people here. I am now left feeling worthless and insignificant in my surroundings. My experience, hard work, and dedication to this company is now meshed into a field of call center employees dashing to meet metrics. On top of the new employees that were hired from this vendor, they also hired managers. I know that people take time to adjust, but these managers are killing our vibe. Salesforce prides itself on transparency. These managers keep secrets and treat employees like worker bees. We have had multiple interactions with upper management where they will talk about a big change, and act surprised when they find out that those of us at the bottom didn't know about the change. The new managers don't understand the need for work and life balance. We previously had options to work remotely when we were ill, or even having an off day. Where we were didn't matter as long as we were doing our jobs. Now, if you are sick and want to work from home, you are asked to take PTO (since you are not given Sick time, you need to use your vacation time)more often, which encourages sick people to come to work and spread their illness throughout the building. Talent seems to mean nothing here as well. It's all about how many years of service. I know of employees who don't put in the effort , who barely get their work done, and they are promoted because of how long they've been here, while I train other employees, mentor, and do still meet metrics, and I'm stuck at the same level. You report to a manager here, but good luck finding your manager if you need something. The Managers are presented as people managers, but when it really comes down to it, they are project managers. I end up doing many small tasks for my manager, that my manager doesn't have time to do, in order to keep my team running smoothly. By no means do I blame my manager for this, but they need to take some of this off their plates. They seem to work 24 hours a day. We recently had a huge push to get our case load down to a specific number. Our portion of the Organization spent 10 weeks squeezing every last drop out of every single one of us to close as many cases as possible. The communication that was sent out read as ""I know you are working hard and thank you for your efforts, but work harder"". After week 8, everyone around me was miserable. There were daily meltdowns from ""Analysts"" who were mad at customers for needing help, when the real problem was the amount of work they expected us to do, and the free time outside of work they expected us to sacrifice. Of course, management didn't see these meltdowns because they were off running Reports on metrics and trying to over analyze the reason behind xyz. When I first came here, I really thought that this was a career. It now feels now different than any call center or retail job I have worked in. This is the longest I've ever worked at a company without receiving a promotion.",6 people found this review helpful

A year ago I was proud and excited to be a part of the company. The Lightning release was a shining moment for how the company's culture can facilitate great things. However, there have been a number of changes over the last year that have slowly eroded the magic - starting with some of the new leadership. Our group has become more fragmented and less collaborative. There's more fear of making mistakes and the general sense of trust and support for our work from our leadership has gone way down. The transparency and access we had upwards is becoming more hazy largely because of layers being added. My autonomy and empowerment to make decisions is slipping away. Politics were always there, but now they're something you have to consider daily. You used to be judged based on the work you created and what you shipped, it doesn't feel that way anymore. Some of my favorite people have already moved on. Perhaps it's just the nature of a company growing this fast. There's not a clear avenue for safely giving upwards feedback for our group.

5119,190,Toxic work environment and culture,,2.0,- Marc Benioff is a great CEO - Building tallest new building on west coast - Training - Commitment to philanthropy 1:1:1 model - Good office location,"Management - Many Managers, Few Leaders - Moral is low. Few are making quota. Micro management is pervasive. Management wants to own all the deals and tell AE's what to do and how to do it. There is no trust in the AE's ability to drive a deal to close. Management attempts to drive rep behavior by fear and focusing too much on the volume of activity. There is a lack of focus on being out in territory vs volume of remote calls / meetings. Management needs to do a better job of using the app to reference next steps and activity. AE's are asked to repeat what is already in the app and often a waste of time and meetings. Quota Attainment and Resources - Very few people are hitting quota and throwing more bodies at the problem is not solving it. We are short of SE's and SE management. We have way too many co-primes units and need to dissolve the service cloud co-prime role. GB and Select comp plan is not aligned to a ""monthly cadence"" and only can make , few people are achieving quota and management is terrible. Management constantly complaining to reps about activity, expense reports or closed business. Monthly cadence for sales isn't aligned to the comp plan for GB and Select roles. A lot of politics.

We should not be on call every night, weekend and on PTO. Reps are NOT encourage to take time away to re-energized and refocus. When reps try to take time off, they are getting daily emails from management. Managers Get Unlimited PTO / Reps Get Very Limited PTO - Managers not get unlimited PTO due to a policy change in April 2017 where Director level and above (management) get unlimited PTO, Meanwhile AE reps are limited to about 2 weeks of PTO and still filling out weekly time sheets! Everyone should be on the same policy - unlimited PTO. Credit on Deals - Another example of the politics and toxic culture is having another AE get credit and commission credit for a large deal they did not do any work on. This impacts the moral, work environment, and obviously commission. Management often overlooks doing the right thing and being inflexible.",8 people found this review helpful

Management talks down to you like I haven't been doing this for 10 years (and my boss has less experience with half the success).... And I was #1 on my team and #11 in the country. They claim compensation is great but when based in Atlanta you get the most bottom of the barrel accounts and this means everything (you have to deal with it). I've never worked so hard for a $2K deal... in. my. life. In my previous life, I never glimpsed at anything under $100K. That was for newer reps. If you sell a $100K deal, you will be at the top for the month and everyone freaks out. So what this means.... what they say you will get paid is a FAR stretch from reality. I was above my number and didn't make what they claimed because when I got my sales compensation package there are all these other factors. Therefore, I made SIGNIFICANTLY less here than my last job. The base was higher but that was it. I'm a hunter and have always been one. Here, it does NOT make sense to focus on hunting because you get new accounts every year and for a prospect to switch CRM's this decision isn't made overnight. Don't let the recruiter tell you otherwise. Trust me. Every current client that I did get, I had to do damage control from previous reps trying to squeeze every dollar out of them. The previous sales reps had their own agenda and it really hurt our clients. Because you get new accounts each year, the previous reps didn't care about the future. They did whatever it took to get $ and then dumped the client. I spent the first 6 months trying to get our clients not to leave us. The office is LOUD because the desk are on top of each other with no sound barriers and all the conference rooms are booked.

5169,240,Principal Software Engineer,,1.0,Brand name. Ok benefits and salary. Voluntary Time Off.,Too much annoying bureaucracy. Your tenure at the company dictates how valuable your ideas are instead of its merit. Huge technical debt and age old technical stack. Code takes few hours to compile and is terrible. Most of the developers are fresh grads or been with the company for an extensive period of time. Engineering executives are non-technical but have been with the company for a long time. Lot of QA folks have been promoted to Director and Sr. Directors as they did a good job buttering up the executives. Too much title inflation in Product and Engineering. Hectic work life balance in San Francisco HQ. Change in Direction of the Product and Reorgs happen almost every few weeks. Mediocre developers keep on changing groups in the Open Opportunity Market and still survive.,23 people found this review helpful

Let's be honest, Midwest people are just some of nicest people around. If you live in Indy there are a lot of great opportunities The sincerity of leadership and the people quickly make you happy to go to work, I actually consider 90% of the people I worked with friends. If you manage your time and have a general interest in the technology there are tons of things to do. I've dabbled in product sessions, support workshop hours, custom app dev, etc. All while doing my day job. Because Indy is small most of the talented people in the area end up at ET. A lot of talent resides in the town, and the C level team strives to keep the company local.","Only Product jobs are in Indy. Comp is only great if you live in the Midwest, if you're hired to work in a remote office be prepared to work with clients of similar skills sets that will make a lot more than you. Benefits are not equal per locale, some offices get parking, food, gyms, subway passes, etc. Simply because that's the bare min to acquire people in that locale, too bad for you if you don't live there. PTO is really poor compared to our parent company SalesForce Benefits are not up to par with our parent company SalesForce, try to find ET benefits and then find SF benefits. You'll notice ET's benefits are impossible to find and SF brags about theirs. That should be your sign. If you're assigned to SOW in Services or Support, there is little to no incentive to move you into something challenging. Most changes are done because of attrition as the organization are pretty flat outside of product. Salary bands don't exist, or if they do they are very lax. It's common someone on your team negotiated really hard and someone just took a college entry job. HR still doesn't have a classification for all skill sets in the field.

The outside reputation of Salesforce being a cult are far overstated, but it does feel like the culture overall is a bit hodgepodge and unfocused.

The first 12 months are sink or swim, and aside from self-enabling yourself, the territories are hit or miss.

Furthermore, Marketing Cloud basically acts as its own company within Salesforce. Collaboration with the CRM business is weak at best, and Marketing Cloud's biggest competitor has been its own internal solution, Pardot. Last, sales managers here are mostly just that, managers.

5335,49,Continues to be a great place to work but..,"Jan 31, 2021 - Lead Member of the Technical Staff",5.0,"- Working with some of the most talented people in the profession - Cutting edge developments - Management structure in Technology that genuinely listens and acts on feedback - Good benefits package (health, dental, wellness/fitness reclaim, education grant) - Depending on direct managers a lot of freedom to take calculated risks - Internal network very willing to help out and share knowledge and success - If you are dedicated and willing to put in the effort required you will move up the ranks but don't view this as just a 9-5 alone. You are encouraged to keep a balance but that's not always possible.","- Sometimes unrealistic sales / business management expectations from product resulting in oversells, it's a solid product but there's a lot of work needed to get to a setup that will do well on the enterprise scale. Smaller setups can work but if you are looking for the big benefits it requires time investment. - The 'family feel' push internally. This is really nice when you are newly immersed in it but you also need to be wary of assuming it's like a perfect family. Families have fights, internal squabbles and sometimes break apart so always look after your own future don't expect that completely from the company. - Steep learning curve if you've never worked on Salesforce product(s) before but there is lots of help there. Still a great place to work and earn professional experience or build your career. Genuinely love the company and everything they've done for me to date.",2 people found this review helpful

I am free to take days off whenever it suits me and don't feel pressured in working harder before or after my PTO to make up for it. I work in the Public Sector patch which is the last high-growth BU, which is a thriving environment.","Targets are very high and in most roles you're working on a saturated market. Prospecting is very difficult as you sometimes only have 3-10 accounts to work with in total, but the target seems to be created from a growth mindset where every account is going through a full digital transformation. Base salaries are relatively low (compared with similar organisations), so if you're not blessed with a great patch, you are going through tough times.

If they don't respond at least to the internal employees, not sure how they interact with the interview candidates. This is very disappointing how they treat internal employees and at least they should respond. I understand ping people are busy some days or times. But not 2/7 or week. Honestly the recruiter experience is worst experience, They don't care at all. They don't respect time and they don't respect individuals and don't reply to at least internal employees.

Some are good but those below are doing anything to be noticed. Salesforce used to have a great culture but lost this a long time ago due to hiring talent from slow beurocratic red tape enterprises such as Oracle. They used to say they dont want to be the next Oracle but that is exactly where they have gone. Leadership within the support organization specifically is appalling, no vision, no care for employees and very blame oriented. No accountability from global support execs all they care about is ensuring if something goes wrong they can shift blame. This has resulted in a toxic environtment. That along with most new support roles being only hired in their India offices is leading to a poor experience from employees elsewhere and customers are suffering for it also with unhappy employees.

5433,147,"Good, if you drink the Kool-Aid...",,3.0,"+ A very reputable brand to work for in the enterprise software and SaaS space. + Huge range of products that can fit into all different parts of an enterprise. + Strong revenue projections and big growth aspirations. + (Mostly) clear and transparent communications from leadership and senior management. + Open feedback culture, with regular employee surveys and check-ins—with employee survey results being published openly across the organisation. + Clear corporate strategy and goals, which trickles down to each employee through the V2MoM process. + Outstanding benefits package and above-average pay rates. + Open, sharing culture, with seemingly endless resources available. + Strong support network within the SE organisation and a willingness to help from other SEs. + Lots of internal resources around talent development and career development. + A very generous education allowance (£5,000 in the UK) that can be put towards almost any course of your choice to help further your career and development. + Excellent treatment of a global workforce mostly working from home, such as home office allowances, extra days off etc.","- Anyone not in a direct quota carrying roles is treated as a second-class citizen, and the sales side of the business (e.g. account executives and sales leadership) is revered and constantly lauded on internal calls. - Obsessive fixation on hitting quotas and revenue targets, which drives a culture of upselling (even when the customer doesn't really need it—despite their ""Customer Success"" value). - It is difficult to relate the SE pay and bonus to company performance—despite ever-growing revenues and beating last year's results, this never really translates into a significant increase in pay/bonus. - Murky promotion and career progression process that gets called out every year in the employee survey, but nothing really gets done about it. Hiring budget seems to be spent on bringing in more AEs (the quality of which varies considerably). - The open, sharing culture has led to oversharing, and useful information and documents are scattered across a load of different sources (Google Drive, Quip, Slack, various Salesforce orgs)—with no single way of searching across all of these. - Lots of internal ""noise"", which can distract from the day job (webinars, endless all-hands calls, irritating Slack channels etc). - Internal culture can feel a bit cultish at times and there is a growing disconnect between the US and non-US workforce. You have to drink the Kool-Aid to get ahead. - The internal Salesforce org (Org62) is a mess making it very difficult to navigate, Lots of duplicate data (e.g. accounts and contacts) across the organisation, which leads to internal fighting over territories/customers. - The company swings between big corporate and scrappy startup: some internal processes are excessively bureaucratic and long-winded (e.g. requiring manager approval for a $5 software purchase), and elsewhere decisions are taken on a whim. - Some employees can feel ostracised if they don't submit to the (exceedingly) left-leaning, social justice obsessed political views of the organisation. - A globally distributed workforce means that emails and Slack messages come in at all hours of the day—depending on the team, internal meetings can start early or run late into the evening.",12 people found this review helpful

Even though we get 19 Days off in the first year, it's hard to take time off because the less you work, the less you make. Company is growing from a startup to a major corporation - that growth means there are a lot of things that are changing and you hear about the ""good old days"" a lot - as if you missed out on how things used to be (not pre pandemic, I mean like 10 years ago) and things have changed a lot.",4 people found this review helpful

Further, read ALL of the other reviews and comments here on Glassdoor.com - specifically the comments. Again there is a reason this company is giving out 10k referal bonuses to all employees who refer a salesperson who gets hired - and the employee(s) there will tell you how wonderful it is - they're desperate for new people to take the crap jobs so the AEs currently there get the good ones .... and the AEs want the 10k bonus for submitting your resume. They're so greedy for it - its all over LinkedIn constantly. PS - Don't believe the Forbes average salary hype either - that salary figure includes a tiny percentage of Sr. AEs who make $1M plus per year. Countless AEs didnt make jack above their base salary last year - ask about this. And if you get pushed out ....

They also bait and switch territories as a way to attract talent. They make you a job offer for a particular territory only to tell you after you have been hired and left your previous job that your territory has changed...and typically the new territory is not of the same caliber and potential of what was promised. Also when a new sales rep joins the company they find that their territory has been cherry picked by several reps on their sales team each having hold outs preventing you from selling into these accounts for up to 90 days.

The accelerators are generally good as well. Some amazing/brilliant people and resources. Company has some brilliant green initiatives. Salesforce tends to spend money for the right events.","Company is struggling with it's identify in some areas. Too many specialists serving a single customer. Often times you need to bring the entire office with you because there is a specialist for different functions (sales, service, cpq, commerce, marketing, oms , analytics, integration, trailhead, ). The frequency that salesforce changes their reps and alignment doesn't tend to sit well with most customers. This has created a struggle to expand, particularly in the enterprise space. Poor alignment between cloud teams for GTM. Most ""generalists"" or ""Account Directors"" are compensated for the efforts of specialists although they don't pull their weight. Many recent reps are fairly green and do not possess the maturity to run a proper sales cycle. Some specialists are running rogue/lone-wolf engagements which can torpedo deals/relationships. Management seems very metric driven, to a fault. Some executive leadership and middle management have no boundaries and will bombard your mobile on weekends.

They will sideline you in all aspect. 3. You can't raise your concern to the HR or ethics department because there also telgu management and at the end they will prove that you are wrong. 4. Managers and Recruiters will highly exploit the employee Referral program . They will only refer and hire there known person to add more Telgu person in the team. No transparency in hiring and stopping the right talent to come in. I am not targeting or blaming Telgu people here but it is the people who are making the culture more Toxic here.

Between companies and their customers or between employees and their teams; Salesforce was founded with three foundational core values: 1. Trust, Salesforce wins through transparency, security, compliance, privacy and performance the trust of customers, employees and extended families. 2. Innovation, innovation is not only reflected in the design of software, but also includes encouraging employees to innovate within the company, encouraging employees to use their imagination, and allowing each employee to use their imagination to create miracles. 3.

However, within a couple of weeks I did, and they sped up the normal recruitment process for me in order to get me on board.

What amazes me is that even though the company has grown to a headcount of 40k+, the opportunities and encouragement for cross-team collaborations match that of a startup.","If someone is hesitant to change and prefers a predictable 9-5 schedule, Salesforce may not be the best fit.",Be the first to find this review helpful

5889,53,A company that TRULY cares about their employees,,5.0,"Salesforce's culture has consistently exceeded my expectations time and time again. Salesforce truly acts in the best interest of their employees, instead of only focusing on shareholders. This has become even more apparent during the COVID-19 pandemic. Salesforce quickly and efficiently shifted to having all their employees work from home to protect their safety, began weekly company-wide calls with the executive leadership team so employees are always away of updates across the company during COVID, financially supported employees' home office setups, made numerous additions to the benefits plan to adjust to COVID-19, and continually prioritize employee wellbeing during all these changes. Salesforce talked a lot about ""Ohana"" or ""family"" in my interviews, I'm so happy to say that culture they talk about to candidates is genuinely the culture we all get to experience day-to-day.

It's voluntold time on-top (of existing work load) for most of the company. We have targets for VTO set, but many business units aren't staffed appropriately to actually take the time off. Instead it's just adding work load on top of our existing work load. Also, the company really exemplifies the wealth gap, with those at the top heavily rewarded with expensive trips, awards (including cars, watches, etc.) while the majority of the company is paid somewhere around the 75th percentile of industry.

5986,150,Top Company in Software Sales,,5.0,"Salesforce was the first to pioneer Saas, and is the leader worldwide today. This is a fantastic platform to sell, that is known universally, and is adopted for a reason. The product works, and it works well. This is a product that any AE can be confident in, and for me being confident in what I sell drives my success. Further, Salesforce takes care of it's employees. I've been blown away by the pandemic response. Salesforce is not only a place that a strong AE can make a lot of money, it's a place you know where management stands. Salesforce management publicly came out and said there would be no lay-offs(there weren't), and pro-actively rolled out programs and incentives to take care of employees. Salesforce is a place you can grow your career, and you can constantly learn. With all of the acquisitions, you can switch to a new product that interests you, or pivot into leadership. I've worked a number of places in my career, and Salesforce is the best so far. There are absolutely downsides, which I get into below, but for me personally I plan to be here for the foreseeable future. Frankly, I believe in Salesforce's leadership team and strategy. We are making some incredible acquisitions and are positioned to be the undisputed cloud leader in ten years.","Politics. If you have only worked at small companies, big companies are a different beast. Salesforce, like any big company, has an element of politicking to it. At any company playing ""the game"" is important, so expect that here. Large quotas, and small patches. Salesforce has fine tuned territory management, and some ae's have stronger patches than others. It is important to succeed early and often so that you have the credibility to be assigned stronger accounts. New employees not willing to hustle and prove themselves do not last. This is how every big company is in my experience. If you don't have a ton of sales experience, make sure you start at a lower title with a larger territory. Big companies are harder to ""learn the ropes at"", as you are competing with the best of the best for things like territory. Other than the above, Salesforce has been the best move in my career, and I'm thrilled and proud to work here. I've never found a place without the above cons, and the pros far outweigh them for me.",2 people found this review helpful

I have been incredibly impressed at everything they have done and continue to do to make sure we still make money, keep our health and family life in mind, and over communicate so we know exactly what is happening inside and outside of the company. COVID aside, the people they hire are all really talented and a culture fit so you are working with incredibly smart people that want to help you succeed even if they don't benefit at all. I don't think I've run across one person yet that hasn't offered to help with anything I need now or in the future.

6002,166,Great place to work - with caveats,,4.0,"Salesforce is a great place to work, for a lot of people a lot of the time. My perspective is mostly from consulting services/CSG, but there are some things that apply across the board. -Excellent focus on work/life balance. Better than anywhere else I've found in terms of consulting or engineering jobs. -Excellent salary. My title maps to ""senior manager"" level as an individual contributor, and all things considered I am extremely satisfied with it. -Health insurance is excellent, in terms of coverage/cost/options. One of the better plans I've seen. -401(k) is excellent if you're an investing wonk. The match tops out at $5k which is middle-of-the-pack, and the plan is through Fidelity (meh) with which you get a good selection of funds, but more importantly, BrokerageLink to invest in the wider markets, and the ability to contribute after-tax beyond the 402(g) limit and auto-convert to Roth with 1 phone call to set this up. This is relatively new in the marketplace, and still rare. Tl;dr is you can contribute as much as $52,000 to your plan for 2020 and characterize as Roth in the end, not $19,500, regardless of your age (research ""Mega Backdoor Roth""), which is a huge benefit for financial planning for highly-compensated employees. -Working for Salesforce comes with a lot of cachet within the world of software vendors and partners, and access to awesome tools and information. If you've been a consultant or worked for an ISV and geek out to the product, you're going to love it here, and often be able to get involved with really interesting clients, projects, and internal initiatives shaping future product development.","I did say ""caveats"". -RSUs are low as compared to FAANG and there are no refreshers - hence, there are a lot of boomerangs, and a reputation as a ""retirement home"", because there is no reward for working harder if you are not also trying to get promoted. -Despite claiming to have a culture of open debate, it doesn't exist and there is seemingly no motivation to change this. For example, even though they say they will answer forum questions relating to the weekly allhands, they never do if it pertains to an internal policy. There is no upward feedback mechanism, except for your direct manager, and on many teams this is a ""player/coach"" who has no involvement in setting the policies of the department. There is an ""airing of grievances"" forum but it is heavily ""tone-policed"". Bottom line is that if you get stuck in a bad situation or team, your options are to change teams or leave, there is no opportunity to improve things from within. -Silos and a lack of coordination result in many internally competitive and duplicative efforts, and inefficiencies. Product-wise there is crossover between Marketing Cloud and Pardot, Tableau and Einstein; and Vlocity/CPQ/B2B Commerce for example. Whatever's new and shiny (acquisitions and Dreamforce announcements) gets love, but if your area is not, good luck getting Trailhead modules or product management to prioritize new feature development. There are approximately 90 billion different efforts to create documentation for consulting resources for how to do their job, all run by different groups and stored on different platforms. And because Slack and Microsoft are viewed as competitors, there is no company-wide collaboration tool like Slack or Teams, it's just a bunch of incomplete tools like Google Chat and Salesforce Chatter and Quip and email and.... -There tends to be a lot of politics between teams, even beyond the product-related competitive/redundancy issues. In short, if you like what you're doing, and who you're doing it for/with, you're in a great position. But if you don't, you're going to have a bad time. I don't know anyone who was unhappy with their situation in Salesforce who subsequently made it better, at least without changing teams.",7 people found this review helpful

Also of note, before you read too much into the other reviews, take the time to notice how many of the 5 star reviews are can be summed up by ""great place to work but has growing pains"" or ""you get what you put in, slackers need not apply"". I will let you draw your own conclusion on why so many of these reviews sound like marketing message .... It doesnt look like ExactTarget understands that they are no longer a startup. The only people that thrive at ExactTarget are people that have no lives. 50+ hours of work a week is the norm and anyone that does less is considered a ""slacker"" as you might have seen in some of these other reviews. If you do the math, you'll realize that the decent paycheck, which is typically higher than the industry norm, ultimately falls woefully short when you look at how much you make an hour. As you work here, you come to find out that it is very much a cult mindset and you are either in or out. Job security comes from owning tribal knowledge of projects that are integrated in to the platform since documentation is apparently a running joke. There are many processes that have been implemented to ""streamline"" development but apparently the management style here is to implement ""solutions"" and ignore the results because the only thing that these processes have done is add one more point of failure to an already broken system. Contractors are treated as second class citizens. Its common knowledge. The way to get ahead is to brown nose and give up on life outside work.

If you’re just starting out, this is a great place to gain some relevant experience and build your resume. When it comes to benefits, there are stocked pantries on every floor. Those working in Indy have access to the ET Gym, ET Fun events (golf outings, paintball, happy hours, etc.) and more. Wellness Bucks - employees are reimbursed up to $105 per quarter for gym memberships, yoga classes, crossfit classes, etc. Through the Salesforce acquisition, ET employees receive 6 free volunteer PTO days per year and even have the opportunity to participate in the Salesforce Employee Stock Purchase Program. Until recently, it was fair to say that ExactTarget had one of the best executive leadership teams in all of SaaS.","Over the last year it’s been sad to see how drastically the company has changed. The “orange” culture is fading rapidly and key employees who cashed-out on stock options are jumping ship for better opportunities. Prominent executives recently left the company and top talent is leaving in droves. A massive restructuring is in order and I suspect that others will follow suit once the fiscal year ends and annual bonuses are paid out to employees. If you work out of the Indy office, you can sense the heightened frustration from those around you. Employees are overworked, underpaid, and have huge unrealistic quotas hung over their heads (with shrinking sales territories). What used to be a company driven by young, ambitious, entrepreneurial talent, is slowly turning into a company motivated by corporate greed and pleasing Wall Street. Two years ago, things were very different but now it is much harder to get promoted, receive a pay raise, or advance your career vertically. ET is very demanding and is notorious for promoting the same people (Director level and above) over and over again. Rarely will you see someone without an MBA or Director-level title, get promoted (unless they brown-nose like crazy).",5 people found this review helpful

The best visionaries, technical ops (the guys that keep the platform up and running), and internal platform engineers on the planet - these are the guys that deserve all the glory. What is done behind the scenes to keep the app going is nothing short of amazing - several million concurrent users while constantly adding functionality and innovating...and no down time? Come on. It's ridiculous. The tenured and long-timers that are still around are incredible. They're not only the best in the company, they're the best in the industry. Prove yourself to them and they will take care of you. If YOU have the drive and the ability, you can build a career path in the company...and if YOU make a case and have something behind it, it's one of the few companies in the world that will allow you to do so. Salesforce will not give you a map when you're hired that shows you a career path...but if you succeed in the role you're giving and prove yourself and earn trust, they'll actually allow you to create your own. The culture of the company is like nothing else in the world. Yes...you are expected to work more than anywhere else in the world...but if you like philanthropy, no questions asked...go do it - on company time. The best in the business keep coming on board. Marc is the best CEO in the business - different for sure - but the best. For a few years I thought the company had plateaued...several different times (at $750M...at $1B..at $2B...)...but I really do see this company making it to $10B in rev and beyond. Without a doubt. So if you're considering joining Salesforce but are worried about growth, don't be. That should be the last of your concerns.","""Fillers"". I call them ""fillers"" because that's what they are...people that were hired in haste to simple fill roles in an organization that is growing so fast, they had to be hired quickly. While they may have gone through multiple rounds of interviews, it seems there are many execs that got through that shouldn't have and are just filling a role in the org chart. And they don't do s*&^. They may have had extremely successful positions at other companies, but Salesforce isn't like other companies. They only slow you down...so if you're smart and have your i's dotted and t's crossed, just go over them and it's not really looked down upon. Tomorrow. You're only as good as the deal you have committed tomorrow. Doesn't matter if you're at 200% of quota for the year 6 months into it ...that actually only amplifies what is expected of you. It's a con...but in reality...it's also not too bad...unless you're in a Sales role that isn't an AE (i.e. SE) because you're capped. Salesforce has the SE's I've ever come across in the industry, and I don't think they're treated as fairly as they should be. Marketeering. This is a new issue at Salesforce... It used to be the case that marketing & PM were in line and no one sold on futures. Over the past 12 months, that has changed...moving closer to an Oracle-like model where the vision is pitched and then they try to build it. Equity. I'm not sure who is getting it, but it isn't long term sales people. Seekingalpha? They couldn't be more wrong. Granted, the ESPP program is fantastic, but once you get beyond entry level, it would be nice to see something. It can be disheartening to hear RVP's (in 2012 I swear they only brought in people as RVP's...""What? You're an RVP of WHAT? And have no reports?!?!?"") and other new employees talking about selling their RSU's or options when they haven't really done anything for the company yet and you've committed the better part of a decade. Commit. This is probably the biggest ""Con"" at Salesforce if you're an AE or in sales. Salesforce is an accurate machine...it really is...based on the subscription model, a great portion of deferred rev is already established and known...but they want your sales opps just as accurate and mgmt will force or override you on your deals if you think differently. Territory. Don't come to Salesforce thinking you'll be able to pick and choose. It was picked over 5 years ago. You'll more than likely get something you don't want. End of discussion. While it seems like it should be the biggest ""con"", it's not. Because everything I listed in the ""Pros"" section means you will constantly have something new and innovative to sell to that minuscule territory you have that no one else can. I mentioned in the ""Pros"" section that some of the long-termers (those that have been around 10+ years) are one of the best things about the company. They ARE. There are also a handful of high level execs that just need to go...they don't do anything...they show up at meetings and say hello and leave... and you better keep your mouth shut. It sucks.

Many times folks are lowballed and get stuck at lower salaries for their level and they don't even know it. Happened to me and it happened to a few people I knew.

As long as your directors are your best friends you will make great money. Promotions on the other hand are another beast.

There are multiple CTOs, my group CTO does not even know current technologies, they try to solve big data problems using PL/SQL and will force you to do the same even if you know Hadoop technologies or other upcoming technologies. 4. The promotion is based on number of check-ins you can make and managers openly tell that. Its absolutely not related whether you checked in test or some stupid UI / xml fix or a routine to mine billions of events to generate recommendations. How dumb management can be in technical aspect? 5. Most of the product managers and product directors are jokers, they decide future product direction and design with no technical background.

There is an ESPP program that can be very rewarding depending on when you got in, and the facilities themselves are nice. Great collaboration with internal utilization of ""Chatter""","While at SFDC I joined just in time to get RSUs, however, I cashed it all out when it hit $150+ and there really isn't money to be made via stock anymore. At my level they didn't do any refreshes of stock, so once you get it, that's it. At higher levels (SVP+) you could make some money, but it's like that at every other tech company in the valley. I don't have much faith in their product growth either. They have penetrated most of the market and there aren't many new logos coming down the pipeline. Most sales are with existing customers with newly acquired products. Speaking of acquisitions, the M&A strategy of buying everything in sight doesn't seem to be working that well, especially with the new senior convertible notes they are issuing. It is difficult to understand what the product roadmap is going to be like if they keep acquiring random products. Maybe Marc has some tricks up his sleeve, but it's not very clear right now. I agree with some prior comments about having to conform. When I joined several years ago, it was easy to speak your mind and get things changed, but nowadays it's all about conformity and agreeing with people. The performance process is not that good either. They go through a V2MOM process (you can find out more on the web about it) and it literally takes me an entire day to fill it out. They have changed things a bit with ""Work.com,"" but it's just that, work. IT Helpdesk is also not very good in my opinion. There is no walk-up station to get things fixed, you have to call a phone number or open a ticket, then wait until an analyst gets back to you. My first week took a couple dozen helpdesk tickets to get up to speed. There was one day my computer was on the fritz and it took literally an entire workday to get it resolved because there was no walk up station.",2 people found this review helpful

6200,191,Good place to work at,"Feb 19, 2013 - QA Engineer in Austin, TX",4.0,"My first few months with Salesforce is good. I've worked in the field for 10 years and been at companies ranging form large corporations to a small startup. I read some of the one star reviews and think people might have different experiences on different teams or people just have different expectations. As for my own experience, compared to the companies I worked for in the past, Salesforce is a good company to work for. It offers above market salaries but also asks you to work hard for it. No doubt the amount of things to learn at the beginning is overwhelming. Luckily new employees are offered plenty of formal training classes. Everyone on the team is ready to help, too, because they got tons to do and really want you to be able to contribute. The company is growing fast so politics might get worse. But don't kid yourself. Wherever there are people, there is politics. I once worked at a 50 employee startup and had to deal with the constant BS going on in the office. Find a good manager who can shield you from a lot of this if you are a technical minded person. And the company allows you to jump between opportunities if you don't really like your current team and/or manager and they can't hold you back. My previous job was at a large software company, where an internal transfer took at least a few months...an offer letter can take up to 6 months for it to go up the management chain and get a headcount...the quality of software was a mess because the management only cares about metrics and spreadsheets and no idea what they were building. So far I haven't seen the same problems at Salesforce. The scrum teams are very small and agile. They do expect you to do real work very quick but working 10-12 hour shifts is not typical.","Lots to learn in the first 3-6 months, very hectic.

Have not seen CEO on the floor in years New hires get dumber and dumber, are more and more scared of rocking the boat. Messengers are punished. Culture incents people to remain silent and go along with the head person's opinions. Basic cultural inability to use fact-based analysis to objectively evaluate performance or productivity. Managers use gossip to inform performance reviews. Management style throughout the company is very kabuki-ish. Obsessed with classist fear of being seen as touching technology. Employees spend more than 50% of their time socially managing their popularity collecting badges, recognitions and rewards in their gamified performance management system rather than doing their day job.

6232,223,The perception is not the reality,"Oct 17, 2012 - Sales Representative in San Mateo, CA",2.0,Recognizable company for resume purposes Free snacks,"Salesforce boasts a great exterior perception, but the real deal is less than glamorous. The sad thing is once you’re hired, if you do want to go elsewhere, other employers wonder what’s wrong with you because of the positive perception Salesforce has. I’ve listed several reasons why I have not recommended Salesforce to my network below. Corporate monster: The company tries to stifle employee concerns with surface-level actions like weekly team-lead meetings regarding employee worries, but nothing changes. All that happens is generic and blanket corporate messages funneled back to concerned employees. It takes years to adjust concerns about quota (ie: why is my Oklahoma quota the same as a Bay Area quota? Which, by the way, is still not resolved). Non-promotions: The company touts “rapid promotion” within the sales path, but the honest truth is that the first three to five years (ie: SR, EBR, and ESB AE) are just doormat positions with little additional salary that take longer than promised to get through. Resentment: Additionally, it is a widely known fact internally that the company hires overqualified individuals at a lower level title than they deserve. This creates a consistent stream of resentment throughout the organization. General work/life balance: For SRs (Sales Reps), our stack ranking is a joke. It leads people to act so immorally and just creates more junk for other people to deal with and waste time on. Since we are stack ranked, everyone is afraid to take a vacation since that means their numbers will be behind others that take no vacation. The department tried to alter the policy saying that reps that take at least 4 days off PTO will not have to worry about that month effecting their promotion, but does not adjust their actual quota for the month (meaning your paycheck still suffers). Lovely. Go to Box or Netsuite, or another great startup-like company that will value you. I’ve recommended other companies over the one I’m currently working for time and again. That alone should speak volumes.",10 people found this review helpful

6273,264,A safe harbor for prima-donnas. Quality of software work is very low.,,1.0,"Pay is great. But the stock options and bonuses serve as a gilded whip to hold over employee's heads. If you put aside your better technical judgements as an engineer you'll get along fine here. If you're able to juggle being harassed by a co-worker every five minutes on IM, e-mail or phone and can still get productive work done, you may like it here. You'll learn about about Agile development and how it can really work - in spite of the fact that group managers ignore the great recommendations of the agile training team. During your first few weeks, do some careful analysis on the source code you'll be working with. There's a sense at the company's that it's somehow infallible and should not be questioned. If you disagree with that view on solid technical grounds, you'll be able to quickly determine whether or not you want to stay on. So, that transparency is a good thing. The software release process and software upgrade process is good. So, you'll learn a lot about that. Training is pretty good, but corporate policy has many self-conflicting points.","Don't expect to impact the software products in a meaningful way while you are there. What you see when you get hired in terms of software coding practices is what you'll be expected to follow. And, unfortunately, there's lots of room for improvement. If you interview here, ask specific technical questions about software best practices and you're likely to get a clever ""non-answer."" A lot of nice talk about what could be done, but nothing specific that translates into actual work quality. While the Salesforce agile approach has all the ingredients a successful team can rely on, the use of those practices is whimsical. The management puts its confidence into junior employees who don't know a thing about building quality software. The middle management is useless on projects. The senior engineers are targets that get poked at ruthlessly. The website products are passable in quality, but the other products like mobile are lame. Lots of false starts and recalled releases from what I saw/heard from those teams. The product vision for the company is unrealistic and egotistical. Management professes that it wants their applications to have an ""addictive"" quality, but they don't even know how to approach that problem. I am glad I'm not there.",14 people found this review helpful

6322,37,The Worst Job At Salesforce Is Sales,,3.0,- Big upside if you are a rockstar. - Strong sense of culture. - Plenty of support teams to sell products.,"- Training is terrible. They throw you into the territory and don't even cover products since ""you don't need to know what they are"". - Zero work/life balance. You'll get mental health days but that's after you've been working 9 hours a day and don't even get to log overtime for it. If you want space, you have to set it and hold to it. - Less than 30% of reps hit their quota and making money is more about lucky timing with SPIFFs than it is skill.",3 people found this review helpful

Collaboration was not easy because teams were territorial and defensive. Felt like people were always watching their backs or backstabbing to get ahead (and this area in particular always scores low on the internal employee surveys). No visibility on how performance is measured and how promotions are decided. Find myself in meetings where everyone’s saying the same thing just for the sake of saying something and getting visibility. And these are the people who are rewarded. Marc Benioff is out of touch. When you keep harping on about “Ohana” but then layoff thousands of employees during a global pandemic when you’ve been reporting major YoY growth, it shows your true colors. I get it, it’s a business. But don’t pretend otherwise. It’s so fake. All this is to say that Salesforce has a very very very strong sales culture and it reflects in its employees. If you can drink the cool aid and go with it, great. But if you value authentic colleagues who genuinely value team work, trust, and collaboration - it’s going to be tough to find here.",4 people found this review helpful

Just like any other company they are in the business of making money and will dump any loyal employee if there is a way to increase the stock price. Watch out after any new company acquisition as the billions invested in the purchase will need to be compensated with laying off thousands of loyal employees in any region (not just USA) even when there are billions of cash in the bank. Laid off victims were given a couple of months to"" find a new position/role"" within the company except to my knowledge NOBODY I know got that coveted new position, I'm sure someone did but how many out of thousands of laid off employees... probably 1%, 3%? Oh yes, there was a high percentage of over 40-45yr old laid off employees as we all know younger employees cost less. So a lot of talk about diversity but in practice it seems there are just some categories that are considered for a diverse work force, older employees are not one of them.

The culture used to be people oriented where you could bring your whole self to work. You could count on a face paced environment but very clearly direction on objectives. You could expect leadership to be focused and thoughtful in their plans and direction. No more. The company still pays lip service to ""Ohana"", equality, and our values. However we have increasingly promoted really good engineers into leadership roles -- senior leadership roles to boot -- who have little idea about what it takes to be an effective leader. The company is disorganized and entirely focused on delivering everything yesterday that there is no room to focus on ""Ohana"" and taking care of the people in the process. Marc no longer is an active, visible leader in the organization. That falls mainly to Brett Taylor who seems content on turning Salesforce into Google.

6485,200,Smoke and Mirrors,"Feb 10, 2021 - Account Executive",1.0,The Salesforce platform is amazing and so is the training that they provide that is usually onsite in San Francisco.,"The ""culture"" at Salesforce is extremely toxic. Everything that they do is purely lip service. Their work life balance? There is none. Diversity, do they make diverse hires? Sure, are you welcome into the office? No. How do they keep getting such great reviews? Take a look at the reviews, most of them are from employees that are 6 months or less. Right after you attend training(which is great) you are sent a survey to rate them on Glassdoor. You are on a high from training and have no idea what you have gotten yourself into yet so you give them 5 stars. Fast forward if you are an AE you are given your territory that has generated virtually no revenue from the year before or was oversold by the previous rep(you are then stuck with handling customer service issues due to poor implementation) and a number that is impossible to reach. Multiple times a week you are required to have a 1:1 with your manager to go over this territory where you are trying to make lemons into lemonade. Nepotism and favoritism runs rampant here. They allow other employees who have ""put in the work"" aka been there the longest to get the best territories and therefore they are hitting their number and eligible for promotions. The irony of this is that they are also tasked with training new employees where they have the attitude of "" pull yourself up by your bootstraps"". They are little to virtually no help because Salesforce fosters an environment where you personally have to be #1. Anything or anybody that could interfere with that is seen as a threat. I could go on about how terrible of an experience this was for me and I also recognize that this isn't everybody's experience as well. However I would be lying if I didn't cringe every time I see articles talking about their next initiative.",27 people found this review helpful

As long as you work hard and do impactful work and establish a strong brand you can thrive here and carve out your own career path. - Amazing benefits and support for working parents e.g. 6.5 maternity leave, 3 month paternity leave, flexible return to work schedule, fertility benefits, etc.","- Can be bureaucratic at times being such a highly-matrixed organization - Although innovation is a core value, company size can interfere with ability to be super nimble and agile for certain departments at times (but this not unique to Salesforce, most large companies struggle with this) - Hard work is rewarded, but you also have to be diligent about establishing your brand and getting visibility with those who have power to help advance your career. So if you are not comfortable advocating for yourself and sometimes shouting your wins from the rooftop you may not want to work here. This is very true in Marketing, perhaps not all other BUs. - While diversity is a core a value, Salesforce like most tech companies are not as diverse as they think, so something to keep in mind if you're a minority. They are, however, making HUGE priorities around DEI initiatives particularly with recruiting efforts.",1 person found this review helpful

You can get your work done, but if you are used to select your own tools or if you come from a Microsoft dominated environment you better be prepared for this as the impact to your productivity may be big in the beginning. The biggest problem to me has been that the Senior Management is not always on a level that I would expect them to be.

Gaslighting, micromanagement, plagiarising ideas, absolute disregard for an employee’s personal time. Add to this the constant reminder of the said person’s insecurities being thrown around in the garb of constantly mentioning their decade-odd years of work experience. These are just some, among the many, problematic aspects that have caused demotivation. However. I would also like to clarify that the person in question is not bad or immoral. They only happen to be a bad fit in a managerial position. This company might be ranked as the best place to work at, but from an employee’s point of view, our life revolves around the people we work with/under, daily. It is unfortunate that it has as not fared well for me. It is quite drudgeoning to constantly hear the phrases “what!!!!!”, “that is not how it works” or “i don’t understand” up until today.",23 people found this review helpful

There is a heavy process around advancement, the main activity being developing your own brand. This involves gaining sponsors at various levels and promoting yourself (sometimes unashamedly) heavily throughout the business. This 'brand campaigning' is by definition political. It is also biased towards those that have the time to commit to it. It is largely dependant on a full and present management chain and those who are actually fully active making a difference at their customers, or who are under resourced and performing multiple roles to serve their customer, do not get the chance to 'seize the opportunity that Salesforce states that it presents. The result is that the talent in the business feel undervalued and the promotions go to the people who have shouted the loudest.

Salesforce prides itself on #Ohana which means family. It is core value/belief of company and makes it an incredible company to work for; Unless you are in Sales,"3 things have changed for me as having been with company for long time and I consider them all Cons 1. Salesforce prides itself on #ohana which is family. Salesforce #ohana is vibrabnt and alive and incredible. Unless you are in Sales in which case its non existent. It is run old school the Oracle way. 2. Customers suffer the most as they did when Sales Leadership ran Oracle. Salesforce is ruthless in scraping every penny from the client, making MSA difficult by not giving an inch on anything. Management wants the number period, if it helps the customer thats a bonus. 3. Execs get paid AE's do not. There are essentially 4 - 5 levels of Sales Management before you get to Keith Block. On the Ground Floor 7 AE's may each carry a number such as $2,000,000 US. There RVP number is not $14,000,000 but about $10 or $11,000,0000. This continues up the management change so at the highest level they will carry a quota that will significantly less the what the AE's carry. End result is Significant amount of reps will be below 50% attainment and my guess is a few percent will knock it out and may 10 to 15% actually hit their number. Opportunity to make real money like in the old days is very slim. Lot of Starving AE's which the company does not seem to mind as they make it very clear there are 10 people behind you waiting for your job.",13 people found this review helpful

This is one amazing goal where the company has invested a lot of dollars. Customer intimacy - Never seen such customer stickiness in a long time. Growth is not measured in revenues alone but also in customer satisfaction and it is taken very seriously. Diversity - Absolutely zero politics so far. Engineers are given a fair chance in every respect of their day to day lives. Ethics is highly valued.","We are going through crazy growth in all locations and especially, Hyderabad, where will be growing from 1100 to about 3000 by 2020.

6735,162,Do not join the Salesforce Support or CSG team,,3.0,- Great pay. - Excellent benefits.,"1. If you're hired as ""Success Agent Tier-2"" for CRM support then your Salesforce career is over because you'll be working in a specific skill group (Configuration, Usage or Email team) and do not get any chance to explore the real Salesforce CRM tool. 2. Management do not to monitor/plan their employees leaves(PTO's) properly which again makes very difficult to work with a huge backlog of cases. You can expect 25-30 cases per agent in AMER shift or 30-35 cases per agent in EMEA shift. NOTE: I have worked in Wipro (worst of all IT companies) so I am very well aware of overload/ extra amount of work. 3. They do not have enough ""Tier-3"" resource which makes your life miserable because as Tier-2, you'll be the only point of contact for the customer who has raised a case. If customer escalates the case or gives you DSAT due to the delay in resolution, then it won't affect Tier-3's performance. Management will simply blame you. 4. So many bugs/ Known issues in every major releases which will make you cry like hell as a support agent. 5. If you ask CSG management to hire more resources to reduce the back log, they'll simply say - ""No we cannot because we do not have enough budget"". 6. HR team sends out an employee survey link in each quarter but that doesn't make any change in your work life. 7. Also when it comes to ""Employee referral""(if your friends, relatives or siblings gets hired then you get $2000/each) program in Hyderabad is one of the most ""Corrupted"" program they've. I have seen 3 examples of corruption in referrals where managers referred their siblings who has really good terms with the ""hiring manager"". They all got selected and each manager earned easy $2000 + Family member (as a salesforce employee). So again if you're hired as Success agent Tier-2 then forget about referring anyone. 8. No way you will get Onsite chance. Strict policy. Also please do not dream of getting free passes/visit to Dreamforce event especially if you're in India. ()",39 people found this review helpful

This in turn will lead to continued and increasing integration challenges and internal company friction; Biggest internal issue I see is that the 'Ohana' culture is leading to employees being too comfortable in their way of doing things and not striving enough for improvement. Combined with this, many managers have lulled themselves into following simplistic metrics and KPIs without understanding the underlying basis for the measurements, nor whether or not they are actually fit for purpose. Arising from this cultural laziness, leadership simply do not have the courage to challenge the status quo and drive the changes needed to improve the company's performance. The technology teams also need to do a better job dealing with the technical debt accumulated from acquiring companies whose technology stack was thrown together with little or no design review",13 people found this review helpful

6797,224,Great place to work if NOT in Sales!,"Sep 25, 2018 -",1.0,"Pardot at the early acquisition phase was a fun start-up martech vibe culture. Adam Blitzer was a great leader before and after he sold Pardot to Salesforce. The commissions paid monthly were good, employee discounts with the likes of Apple, movie vouchers, free drinks, fruit and snacks and healthcare benefits for you and your family especially in those unexpected incidents is just outstanding. The leadership that came from Atlanta was very charismatic. I recall times when the VO Sales would jump on a call with a prospect at the 11th hour remotely at the oddest time to help regional teams. Who does that? It’s things this you will always remember. In terms of people, when you find a core group of individuals whom you trust and can lean of for advise and support, it goes a really long way in otherwise a very demanding role","Don’t get all too bubbly with what you see in public about this company with their philanthropic model of giving back and rising stocks because behind closed doors it has to be one of the worst experiences as a sales professional. 1. I don’t think SF thought about the Exact Target and Pardot acquisitions because it created a lot of issues such as internal conflict between Exact Target and Pardot reps over the right solution for an interested customer, 2. Salesforce Account Execs having to put quota relief size over the right solution and with Pardot the smaller investment price tag over its Exact Target meant you would lose out pretty much all of the time. 3. The quotas in the upper customer segments were not aligned to the sales cycles and instead geared towards the SMB segments. 4. Little empathy from the local leadership who were well aware of these challenges and instead ignore the issue as the revenue seemed to be the only concern. There is a reason why there is a high churn it nobody there seems to care. Was once commented that the sales recruitment process is like an “assembly-based manufacturing plant” in that reps go out as much as they go in and that at the end of the day “nobody cares”",15 people found this review helpful

6829,256,Heroku,"Jul 30, 2018 - Principal Member of Technical Staff",5.0,"Heroku has had its ups and downs over the last few years as it has become more integrated with the larger Salesforce org, but it still feels staffed by the best minds in the business, and I love the product that we make. Salesforce itself has all the pros and cons of a large org, complete with hawaiian culture kool-aid and large-org inertia, but on the whole it feels like Benioff puts his money where his mouth is on societal issues, in a way that few corporate titans do. They're generous when it comes to family and benefits and have a corporate culture of giving. Inside Heroku, we are still a little bit inside our purple-tinted bubble. On balance it feels like the engineers, junior to senior, are a standard deviation or two above the median. The problems we solve are difficult and satisfying. The business is large and the opportunity remains even larger. It feels miraculous that we operate a product at such crazy scale with so few people, and speaks to our expertise in building scalable, automated things.","These are more Heroku issues than Salesforce issues. We were (and still are) strapped for headcount over many years. This leads to serious team health issues and burnout. Exec is keenly aware of the issue and taking steps to fix it, but it should never have gotten this bad. At the moment, our product org is also sorely understaffed following turnover and departures, which means that many engineering teams don't have anyone to help them make sound product choices. We get by, but the product roles are critical, and the product managers we have are spread way too thin. As above, our exec team is aware of the problem and trying to hire as fast as they can. These are short- to medium-term issues. I believe they'll get worked out and we'll have smoother sailing in a few months. Longer term, my larger concern is complacency. I don't know if Heroku/Salesforce has the gumption to make the big bets to really grow our business and remain relevant for the next epoch. For the last decade we've made it drastically simpler to run compute workloads in the cloud, and it's built a large and successful business. With containerization catching on and tooling becoming more mature, we're being commoditized. I don't know that exec has the appetite to determine what the next ""git push heroku master"" is, and allocate enough resources to pursue it. That feels like an existential threat.",1 person found this review helpful

6845,3,One of the best teams to work in Salesforce - Demo Engineering,,5.0,"Salesforce is an awesome place to work. I was fortunate enough to work with few teams in Salesforce during my tenure. Demo Engineering was one of them so when I heard about some rumblings about this team, I thought of sharing my perspective. DE is one of the most amazing teams in Salesforce to work. It houses some of the best talents from the Industry with diverse cultural background. If you bring two things to the table talent and right attitude then irrespective of your gender, age or experience you get the spot on this team. I’ve seen leadership bring in lot of fresh talent with almost no experience but with right attitude. Also there have been cases when folks with not-so-great english were also given opportunity solely based on their talent. How to use technology to bring transparency in an organization is something one should learn from Salesforce. From number of demos you worked on, number of hrs you logged or even number of times your received appreciation, everything is open and accessible at each level from your peers to top global leadership. DE Team is entrusted with task of delivering successful demos where you are racing against time. There is lot of support and encouragement not just from leadership but even from within the team. During my initial days, team helped me learn and get up to speed with work. Whenever I was stuck with anything, team was just a call away. I’ve never worked in a team with such strong sense of ownership till now. During my tenure, India team was leader among global teams in delivering most number of successful demos. There is lot of focus from on your professional and personal growth. I’ve seen people getting nominated for various technical and leadership trainings. Also, Salesforce was kind enough to identify and sponsor trainings for folks who face challenge in communication. You are encouraged to create your own development plan keeping your talent and aspirations in mind. Leadership helps create various growth opportunities for each team member. There is guidance and coaching available for each member. I've seen successful transitions from this team into various roles within Salesforce and even outside. In their pursuit of giving back to society, Salesforce encourages each employee to volunteer. They not only provide paid time off for such volunteering activities but also give hefty sum of $2000 as a grant which each employee can donate. Volunteering activities are available throughout the year and employees are free to choose them as per their interests and beliefs. DE is one of the few teams in Salesforce where each team member proudly achieves their volunteering goals every year. Salesforce provides flexibility of work hours and work from home. Each team defines their own schedule and work hours keeping healthy overlap between their global peers. DE work hours in India are 9-5. At times you are required to get on a call with global peers late evening or early mornings but the folks are always considerate of the fact.",Nothing I could think of.,3 people found this review helpful

6848,6,Advice - Don't fall in the trap of Infra org positions!!,,1.0,- Great visionary CEO - Good compensation/Stocks - Food and snacks - 1:1:1 volunteering model and lot more...,"- Lack of Transparency in every thing, whether it is promotion, interviews, work etc. Promo - Collect feedback from your favourite people and get promoted to VP even if your sub ordinates or people working under you don't like your style of functioning. Just like typical Indian govt. office promo's where you throw money here you throw feedbacks. Interviews - Whom to hire for the position, what qualities to look for, what job responsibilities should be conveyed, no clarity. Hire and attract talent by throwing industry buzzwords like etc. containers, docker, kubernetes, etc and tell them to work on round the clock patching or deployment work. (No forum to raise this concern apart from glassdoor) - No clear vision from senior/mid senior management/infra leadership. People at bottom most level who don't know what they are supposed to be delivering in infra. Software engineers working on operations work to resolve switch issues and fixing racks, working with DC engineers. They don't have any clarity or vision of future from leadership. (No forum to raise this concern apart from glassdoor) - How to get all star award? Well there are lot of ways to achieve it: 1) Sit in US HQ office and screw things in production time and time again and get a all star award. If you do the same from Hyderabad then you will land into PIP (Performance improvement program). 2) Create a half baked software or an automation working in silo without taking any requirements from actual endusers. Create a hype around it, push it to prod with no proper testing, provide zero documentation, get stocks/promo's/all stars and then move out of the project to screw something else. - No alignment Work for some other team and report to someone else in the management chain who has no idea what are you doing. V2MoM of folks in hyderabad is more of marketing gimmick it fails to provide any alignment, clarity or vision for people working at the ground level. When you are asked to talk about it no ones know how to get it sorted, they just want to keep doing things the way they are because end of the day they are more concerned about there own promo's.

Competitive pay with amazing benefits and perks. My favorites are wellness and education reimbursement. 5. Work quality is good, got to work on some really cool products. 6. They encourage you to control your own career in fact you can transfer to other teams for an opportunity if you fit the bill. 7.

The hiring process took almost 10 weeks and I had to call at least 10 - 15 times to remind them to release the offer (even the hiring manager confirmed I have been hired) 3. Information overflow (very poor signal to noise ratio). Sometimes you will be amazed at so many emails/chatter flying around you and you don't know what to do abou it. 4.

Horrible management and lack of leadership and responsibility 2. Salesforce Hyd R&D does not hold the title well since most of the work is service based. 3. The R&D management does not offer growth, leaders of this group are very impatient and rude. Not worth being in good books. No respect given to peer’s and sub-ordinates, R&D management is only concerned about its own position and growth. 4. The management in Hyd office will claim that Salesforce among the best companies to work for - this is true but only applies to the US head office, certainly does not apply to Hyd office. 5. Don't be surprised that young employees working in this company for quiet some time can be political and very influential. 6. The maturity in most employees is below par. They have only one thought in mind, how to grow and get more money no matter if they have to step over there own colleague. 7. Work life balance is bad in some teams. Expectation is you will have to slog and meet the deadlines. If you don't then you need to look elsewhere. 8. Salesforce Hyd has always been on the HQ's radar in terms of quality of work and deliveries. Unfortunately the situation is not good. 9. Quality of work is ridiculously below par. People don't care if the code is messed up, all that is important is releasing the product with the proposed feature. 10. In some teams, employees argue and embarrass each other with respect to deliveries. They don’t care about one’s self respect, no respect for other colleague, finger pointing is a very common phenomenon. 11. Feedback sickness - management will constantly take feedback from diff employees working in your team, if anyone gives wrong feedback; that will not be communicated back to you, instead it will be used against u. 12.

At an individual level, we are encouraged to volunteer in our community (we get 56 hours of volunteer time off per year) but on a company-wide level, our leaders have taken stands to improve the state of the world.

Get to work with some amazing peers.,"It's with a heavy heart and reluctance that I share my review. Salesforce is an amazing company, however, within the department I work there is an overriding culture of insidious bullying, throwing people under the bus, lack of support, openness, coaching and development. Promotions are based not on your ability but for political reasons and whether your face fits, especially if you are able to 'toe the party line' and do not step out of line with the department head. This environment has been created and sustained over the last few years based on fear; if you are good at your job and have a point of view, no matter how professionally you express it you know your time is limited. The final result? A department which is wouldn't look out of place in North Korea, you would state black is white just to keep your job. It really is that bad. The worst of it is that this is known about at a very senior level and for some time and yet nothing is done to remove the perpetrator from the organisation. For fear of retribution I dare not share any further details, suffice to say that it's non-sales, and it's a department which should be the gold standard for promoting the Aloha culture. I'll leave it at that.",20 people found this review helpful

More focus on sales than technology. Not being 'customer first'. Not a clear career progression path. Seemed to be much more about who you know than acting as a meritocracy. More effort should be put into making Salesforce a great place to work than there is making Salesforce *look like* a great place to work. Glossy brochures don't make up for the fact that you can't view payslips online. But the single worst part of working for Salesforce is the lack of an engaged HR department. So-called ""Employee Success"" are distant, hard to reach and ultimately unhelpful.

As I work in a global team with my colleagues across the world, the diversity is mind blowing. One of my colleagues is an actor in movies, the other one has travelled to 29 countries, my super boss was a part of a very famous American TV show in her young days!! There is lot of stress on wellness and being fit with bike month, running challenges as well as on giving back to the society with fun team volunteering events right from Day1.

Most customers and new leads are happy to speak to Salesforce. - Great earning potential, obviously if you are doing well, but even if you aren't, product spiffs and bonuses can help towards making your OTE. - Benefits cover almost everything you can think of. Highest education reimbursement I've seen in tech companies. Base pay in esmb could be improved, but it depends where you are in life if you value the cash or benefits more. - Room for promotion (it can be slow, but no slower than most big tech companies). - A no brainer move if you aren't already in the tech industry- one of few tech companies that seems to be open to hiring non tech sales backgrounds. A lot of the cons below happen everywhere so you may as well benefit from Salesforce's great benefits and commission. - Their selling methodology isn't for the faint hearted, but you genuinely will learn a lot about selling.","- There are 4 layers of management between you and the person who manages SMB . All these layers are forecasting to each other and it just seems to fuel the micromanagement activity and meetings for the sake of meetings culture. - Managers only care about their team number and really don't care about how you are doing individually. Leads to micromanagement when the team isn't doing well. If you are doing well, there's no real incentive for you to do better for the sake of the team, it's just what your manager wants. - Territories and verticals are very uneven. Best territories given to more tenured AEs which happens in a lot of companies, but makes your first year difficult to succeed without some luck. - Really not much culture day to day. There are team dinners and days out but not much is done to create a sense of fun in the job itself. This was the same even in the office. - No recognition outside of $ closed. - Apart from one or two, the product specialists only seem to want to help when your deal is about to close.",6 people found this review helpful

Under this leadership, the India team has a sluggish growth to their careers. - Unrealistic targets and workloads are set for the team which led to long working hours and high pressure high stress work environment. - Work done here is boring, low impact and repetitive. There was no career defining work in this team for the time this review was written. - Management is a bully, openly threatening and humiliating team mates. Several incidents of this have occurred. But employees are too frightened of retaliation to bring out the issue. - Top down policies and decisions. Team mates have no voice and have to follow all decision leadership makes. - High stress environment created by an autocratic leadership. - Team is expected to work long hours and weekends. - Team are heavily monitored and micromanaged. Egs if you do not clock in by 9 am you will be called out in an email, in a public meeting and reported to HR. - Management is indifferent to creating career growth paths for its team members who do not want to become Solution Engineers. - Limited slow promotions, terrible hikes and highly gated pathways for internal transfer. Management claims that Demo Engineers are highly regarded in the company, yet demo engineers are not top choice for internal transfers, in India. - The leadership of India team creates unofficial policies that are against the overall organisation policies. Examples are non-reimbursement of failed attempts at certification. Use of whatsapp as an official communication channel, tho it is explicitly banned by salesforce. - Skip levels are highly discouraged.

However, within a couple of weeks I did, and they sped up the normal recruitment process for me in order to get me on board.

The company is built on certain core values and these are amazingly into each and every employee. The working staff and management are very kind, understanding and motivating. The other best thing about them is the equal pay policy. This means that everybody at a certain level gets paid in the same range if not exactly equal. Salesforce calls it Ohana which means ""Family"" and it truly is!","Salesforce has very good pay and initially you may get really good hikes as well but in the long term if you decide to stay back, which the company will tempt you to do so, the pay increases might get smaller.

You’d expect a company like Salesforce to have a smooth process. But here’s the real story- My onboarding and interview was an absolute nightmare. This was my dream company, so obviously when I received an offer from them, I accepted it, even if it meant taking a huge pay cut. These guys would leverage Salesforce US culture into talking you down for salaries but would say shamelessly that Salesforce has a transparent pay scale. When I entered the company, I found out that I was the least paid employee in the team. Anyhoo, I accepted the offer and it was their turn to send laptop and other peripherals. Well they didn’t, their procurement team never replied, not on slack, not on calls, not anywhere and I had to bring senior management into this. Well after 15 days of joining, I had received the laptop but mind you even though you don’t have your company phone or company laptop, they’ll start evaluating your performance from day 1, because dude you are in Business Development. So you gotta be an Einstien and a God maybe to do 500 billion things at one time and managers even then would find a way to complain. They expect us to work for 10 hours every day, attend useless meetings, and work like a machine without taking a breath. And they’ll preach about the helping culture of Salesforce, lol. The AEs don’t respond on time, hell even the managers themselves don’t respond until you ping them again and again. And they want us to feel gratitude for the company bevause it pays salary. They have 0 empathy for their employees, they turn deaf ear to our problems. I am suffocating here but I can’t teach out to anyone because guess what everyone is the same. This is a typical employee exploiting company which has created a bubble of a good work culture. PS- this is just for India.

7357,149,Ha perso valore,"Sep 13, 2021 - Account Executive in Dublin, Dublin",2.0,High benefit Nice office environment (but less than other tech companies in IE),"Salary is under the tech industry avg in Ireland. Left after two years, I feel like the whole environment became much more hostile towards employees. At the beginning there was more learning space, career advancement expectations and good management, but I think the company lost track of the value of the employees lately and they are experiencing high attrition rates as a consequence. No space to express opinions and suggest improvements, some markets are restructured and there is no easiness of communication. Most of the colleagues who started with me left for better opportunities in terms of salary and benefit. HR is very slow at replying and they closed the main Public (internal) channel of communication- I guess because there were too many complaints to take care of. Management is often disorganized and issues are solved slowly if ever, resulting in frustration for the employees and possibly financial and work balance consequences. Satisfaction surveys are often handled out but results are not taken into account- or at least that’s what seems like. Some teams were asked to disclose if they undertake interviews with other companies. No clear vision to go back to office and giving reassurance to teams.",4 people found this review helpful

My managers are flexible and trust me, don't apply a micromanagement style which works best for me. I feel hugely appreciated and respected by my team. Whenever I wan't to do something my way, I will usually get a go to do it. The benefits are great, but only if you hit or come close to your target. I am free to take days off whenever it suits me and don't feel pressured in working harder before or after my PTO to make up for it. I work in the Public Sector patch which is the last high-growth BU, which is a thriving environment.","Targets are very high and in most roles you're working on a saturated market. Prospecting is very difficult as you sometimes only have 3-10 accounts to work with in total, but the target seems to be created from a growth mindset where every account is going through a full digital transformation. Base salaries are relatively low (compared with similar organisations), so if you're not blessed with a great patch, you are going through tough times.

Very toxic, backstabbing politics going on amongst executive assistants which creates an entire group of disgruntled, distrustful, and power hungry EAs and makes most EAs carry a bad reputation at Salesforce. Execs and managers who have EAs: some of them need serious management training and learn how to treat everyone under them fairly. This was by far some of the worst treatment I’ve ever seen from an exec who had an EA. Micromanaging, having other people spy on the EA and report back to him about the EA's whereabouts and movement.. The EA was treated like a prisoner. Also, there are some EAs who support C-level people and they act as if they are the exec's themselves. They wield their execs' status for their own power and control over others. It's ridiculous and I don't know if the execs who have EAs even know that their EAs are doing this. I hated working with any execs who had EAs. It was always a massive hinderance to my work progress. I don't understand Salesforce and the EA culture.. some are really great EAs but some are terrible and unfortunately they are the EAs at the top.. usually supporting SVP and up. I wouldn’t buy into their culturally appropriated “OHANA” and other Hawaiian sayings. It’s all a facade.",22 people found this review helpful

Yeah, that describes the intensity.","The executive leadership team at Salesforce exemplifies the values they espouse and they truly believe that the world can be changed by business. Unfortunately, the values that are core to our belief system (doing what's right for the customer, trust, etc.) do not filter down to the actual sales process. There's a tendency to encourage customers to do things unnatural to their buying process, all in the interest of making the month. You will subjected to immense pressure here. The company, to their credit, has tried to emphasize wellness with meditation rooms in each office, etc. But much like volunteer time off, I know very few sales people that have time to enjoy those perks outside of offsites.

The rate of growth at times creates confusion and certainly poses organizational and system challenges.

The result is that sub-optimal processes don't always get corrected. As the company has grown, a lack of focus on small details results in some areas of the business suffering until something serious occurs that draws attention to it. Salesforce is unabashedly a Customer Company. When given the choice to pivot to Customers, Shareholders, or Employees, the company will always choose Customers.

Not saying there aren't good managers, but there are a lot of bad ones. To fill the void, Salesforce hires externally (i.e. Oracle) who brings their less-than-desirable practice into Salesforce. Lack of homegrown leadership is the company's biggest weakness, by far - Customers get tired: We all hear our customers are tired of getting ""nickled & dimed to death"" because we keep on coming out with new features, new acquisitions, new bundles that cost ""only $xx more per user/month"".",4 people found this review helpful

VPs promote who they want, when they want irrespective of team feedback or even despite what are believed to be established policies. VP-level leadership exhibits schizophrenic decision making, CYA behaviors and abrasive comportment. This makes for highly stressful working environments and is a key cause of the well-known burnout at Salesforce. Many leaders at Salesforce have never done a job this big before which can lend to insecurity and erratic or absent decision making.

Though in reality the territories are not the same and each year the territories get smaller and smaller while the the quota rises. The company is satisfied with having only 55% achieve their quotas and qualify for club because they don't expect 45% of the reps to attain their quotas. So 45% of the reps are set up for failure. They also bait and switch territories as a way to attract talent. They make you a job offer for a particular territory only to tell you after you have been hired and left your previous job that your territory has changed...and typically the new territory is not of the same caliber and potential of what was promised. Also when a new sales rep joins the company they find that their territory has been cherry picked by several reps on their sales team each having hold outs preventing you from selling into these accounts for up to 90 days.

The first 12 months are sink or swim, and aside from self-enabling yourself, the territories are hit or miss. Sales reps that have crushed their quota at other companies often struggle due to poor territory carves and slow enablement ramp time. Furthermore, Marketing Cloud basically acts as its own company within Salesforce. Collaboration with the CRM business is weak at best, and Marketing Cloud's biggest competitor has been its own internal solution, Pardot. Last, sales managers here are mostly just that, managers.

There is a culture of not giving feedback and you need to ""read between the lines"" in order to know what feedback there is (this is what was told to me by management). On our team, promotions are given to the men more often than the women, and men with the same title and less experience as women have higher salaries. Also, the skill of managing people isn't seen as part of the requirements of being a people manager.

Opportunity to really contribute to change. Access to global organizations (customers) making a difference in the experience of great numbers of people.

Hard to imagine working for another company not as excellent. Also, not really cons, but challenges: it's hard to balance an intense, growing, sales-oriented company with all the good work, culture, and support we receive. Salesforce is among the best at balancing, but there are no silver bullets. Company has grown to a very large size quickly and managing scale is also challenging. Again, the culture and communication make it among the best at this size and growth rate, but it too can be a challenge sometimes.",Be the first to find this review helpful

7602,114,Want PTSD - Work for Salesforce,,1.0,Plush office space Snacks Nice view from the upper floors,"Salesforce is the most toxic organization I have ever worked for, and I've worked for a lot of organizations as both an FTE, contractor, and consultant over the past two decades. Trying to pare down what I want to warn others of is difficult. I'll just bullet it out and you can decide what would wear you down, disrupt your sleep, and leave you paranoid, the most. - 1:1s with senior management where the most hateful things are said about your character, etc., and then afterward, the manager acts as though it never happened. -Pressure to give Salesforce a glowing Glassdoor rating after less than 30 days at the company when you do not know enough to provide an accurate review. - No written reviews, something called a 9 box where management provides their opinion of you and tells you it exists but then says you are never allowed to see it, per H/R. - If you want to apply for an internal position, you must have your manager's permission first. If you tell your manager you want to apply for the role and he/she does not want to lose you, he/she just says, no, you do not have my permission. Game over, you are going no where. - If you are allowed a desk (many have to submit to hoteling and never knowing where they will sit day to day), no personal plants, photos, or non SF toys allowed. They want a uniform look to the desks. -Forced volunteerism, if you do not log your 50 hour minimum of volunteer hours per year, you will be shamed at team meetings. Doesn't matter if you have kids, sick parents, 60 hour work week, whatever, you are expected to make the minimum. -No criticism of Benioff permitted. And don't ever say out loud that you found it disturbing to see a laying on of hands and someone praying over him as though he were a prophet at an internal company meeting. Management will quickly remind you that he is leading the 4th industrial revolution and he is the leading mind of our time. -If you are managing young hourly employees, be prepared to be instructed that you are to tell them they MUST go to team dinners, volunteer events, and SF ""fun"" activities but this is not work, so they don't get paid. If you push back, you will be reprimanded for ""not being Ohana."" - Teams are run by popularity. Backstabbing, shaming, and shunning are used to get the teams to stay quiet about how bad things are. People who speak out about behaviors, lack of professionalism, etc. are labeled, ""unOhana"" and told that they are not acting like family. - When you interview and you take a position, there is ZERO guarantee that the role you interviewed for and were hired for is the role you will be doing. The management opinion is to hire highly qualified people, they will be so grateful to be permitted to work at Salesforce, they will do whatever job we give them. I kid you not, you may have more than a decade of experience, be highly technical, have managed teams, and be hired for a technical role, then be told you are going to do data entry level work and you will be glad you are permitted to be at this company doing that. -If you are uncomfortable participating in some public events, e.g. parades, events, etc., and SF is participating in one, there is incredible pressure to spend your weekend in the parade or event. The expectation is that Salesforce and its needs come first. I cannot stress this enough, you are told that Salesforce is YOUR family and your family comes first. A lack of loyalty to the company will get penalized far more significantly and quicker than complete incompetence, maliciousness, or even harassment. Salesforce demands absolute devotion.",54 people found this review helpful

The people are great and their is a real team environment. People really want to help and do the best for the team and the customer. I've never seen another company close to this. Salesforce also follows a model that donates 1% of revenue, 1% of time and 1% of product to charity. As an employee, I get 5 days of Volunteer Time Off and charitable donation matches. It's also super easy for me as an employee to get that match and log VTO time. Salesforce is setting the bar in this space along with Patagonia. Salesforce is also trying to be sustainable and is a carbon-neutral cloud. . No other company can say that. Compensation aside this company is a 7 on a scale of 1-5.","That said the compensation is a quagmire of BS. First you can already expect an OTE significantly less than what is the norm in the industry. Worse still is the 40 acts of vaudeville to figure out if you will get paid, if you get paid and what amount they base it on. We are out there saying use Salesforce as your system of record and every month my Xactly has little similarity to my sales in Salesforce. Come on, guys. Let's not be hypocrites! Then when you think it can get no worse there is a virtual rubics cube of ways you lose ACV or see $ clawed back. You have to be an accountant to figure out if you can sell to an account and retire quota. It's ridiculous how many times, in a short time I have not gotten the full value of my sale due to some arbitrary attrition I was not even aware of as a co-prime. Do you want me to sell or do you want me to audit the accounts to see if I can retire quota with a sale?",14 people found this review helpful

(2) Title inflation: When I accepted the job offer, I thought I would make a career progression, which it was title wise, but after I joined I realized that I had in fact less responsibility than before. This wasn't obvious to me because the compensation was considerably higher than at my previous company. I wished I had asked more questions and had asked for a higher title. (3) No cafeteria at HQ: you need to leave the building to grab food. This by itself is not a big issue. In fact, it means you have so many different lunch options ... every day. Yet, the ability to socialize with co-workers within your team and more importantly outside your team is not as easy as at companies where there is a common lunch area.

Keep in mind this review is coming from someone who was cosidered realtively succssful, and still think this place is a joke. Anyways, I digress.... Middle management for the most part is made up of people who lack leadership skills, talent, experience. It’s actually joke. It’s like a weird cesspool of account executives being promoted to management. One day theyre your peer, the next day, they’re your superior. Not saying they’re racist or anything, but holy hell, talk about 95% Caucasians Being promoted into these roles. Overall, management (based on my experience, observations, talking to peers,etc) literally brings NO value. They just sit at their computer and run reports, show up late to customer meetings, sit awkwardly/quietly in a conference room during a customer call, but during 1on1s (these are also frequent, redundant, waste of time), they offer to sit in on calls/meetings as if They are providing value. If you’re one of the unfortunate suckers/victims to work for Salesforce please please please understand, your entire success, compensation, will be 99% based on the territory handed to you. That’s it point blank. All the other BS, is Just that BS. Run a few reports and you’ll see the top performs get most of their ACV from organic aka gimmes or flips aka warm leads handed to them by the inside biz dev team. Team. Yes, working hard and doing everything the right way (by the book) will give you a very slight edge, but if you’re not handed a fruitful territory you WILL NOT hit quota or make money. Pleeeeasse, please take this as the truth. Again, I was a top 10-20% person, and I’m leaving this review. I could go on and on, but I’ll end it with this. If you’re an experienced sales professional, do NOT work here. You will regret it and regret it fast.

Growing to fast and not able to keep up with overall growth.

If you are on the BDR team you can be the hardest working person and still not hit your number because of how your quota is attained. Your manager will ""help you"" come up with ""strategic plans"" to hit your number (basically just tell you to make more calls/set meetings) but it doesn't matter because if you AEs refuse the meetings, don't feel like moving them to a stage 2 (everyone perceives what this means differently), don't have time to take them until the next month, etc. then you are screwed.

This is just not a conducive business model and doesn't help growth initiatives. Not everyone is measured the same. You could be aligned 2-4 AEs or 10-15 AEs as a BDR. Either way, these people are expected to generate the same amount of ""stage 2"" opportunity. If you have 2 AEs that are busy, don't work in your office or don't have the ""need"" for a BDR to generate pipeline - then you have NO chance of hitting your quota. SDRs, BDRs and AE's are all expected to generate their own pipeline - which makes sense but it is causing people to compete with each other which takes away from making the customer #1 priority. This is especially bad since the Mulesoft migration... (from BDR POV) Although Salesforce always talks about endless internal growth opportunities, this is def not something that I have seen to be encouraged. You are pretty much forced to take the typical promotion track. BDR Management is way too pushy with BDRs setting new meetings and business, while this should be a significant responsibility, lots of customers get mislead, forgotten, or treated with poor customer service which eventually will backfire (I have already seen it backfire a few times!) As a BDR you could generate $5mil in the pipeline one month, but only have 2 stage two opptys on the board (you need around 6-8)...which means you will miss your quota. Others could have 6-8 opptys on the board which only adds up to $300k in pipe for the month, but they will hit quota.. Doesn't make sense.",14 people found this review helpful

Do not expect work life balance. - Claim they pay hourly including overtime, but management often caps hour submission at a certain level. Therefore, don’t expect to get paid for all the hours you actually work. - don’t anticipate management to help or coach you - culture seems very dependent on your location, rely on culture reviews accordingly. - Big push for monthly quotas, yet told by tenure employees almost 60% of business done in the last quarter.

You feel pride working at Salesforce. For the most part leadership is talented.","The media has an image that Salesforce is the number 1 place to work. This is not the case for sales. Many of the sales reps are unhappy with many things but stay because of how well the company performs/innovates. Base salaries are extremely low. There are very few people that are hitting their annual numbers and the overall compensation plus base is just not there. So much of it is based on territory but leaders will say to their graves that all territories are even. We would have much more appreciated it being called out vs. lying to our faces that they are all spread equally. Overall there is a lot of negativity here and much of this stems from the unhappy customers. Salesforce customers, especially in the SMB space don’t have the money to spend to implement Salesforce so their orgs are bad and adoption is extremely low. Account executives are responsible for selling - but also dealing with all unhappy customers, cancellations, technical support questions, etc. It doesn’t help that the renewals and billing teams are both outsourced to foreign counties and are extremely hard to work with (both internally and externally).

It's voluntold time on-top (of existing work load) for most of the company. We have targets for VTO set, but many business units aren't staffed appropriately to actually take the time off. Instead it's just adding work load on top of our existing work load. Also, the company really exemplifies the wealth gap, with those at the top heavily rewarded with expensive trips, awards (including cars, watches, etc.) while the majority of the company is paid somewhere around the 75th percentile of industry.

The ability to do interesting work, connect with other talented individuals, and the training/learning opportunities.","On a recent survey, two of the lowest scoring questions revolve around people politicking and backstabbing to get things done and the lowest score company wide was promotions are handled in a fair and transparent way. The promotion question has been a bottom 5 scoring question for 2 years now. I have witnessed people promoted either for unfair reasons or because threatening to leave. They pass off a promotion as someone being promoted when in all actuality they applied to an internal job posting and were hired, that’s not really a promotion. The answer to fixing this is not more documentation on careers. They put on a front that they value trust and transparency. They want you to be able to have difficult conversations with your manager without fear of retaliation, but I have witnessed people who speak up and are retaliated against with maybe a Performance Improvement Plan or a demotion. I sometimes feel as if managers and leaders here are talking the talk but not walking the walk when it comes to truly living by the Ohana values. There is a feeling on some teams that it is easier and less stressful not using your PTO vs using it. Tough finding and training multiple backups to handle their job and yours while out. Recently a decline in billable work that has them reassigning people to new careers. It is tough seeing work sent to vendors in India when people at Salesforce are struggling to get billable work. Bonus for some 100% based on billable work which you have no control over. Person A could have 4 accounts and 40+ billable hours, resulting in a very healthy bonus; while Person B might have 1 account and is receiving 10 hours of work, receiving a much smaller bonus. The division of labor is not fair and should be distributed more evenly. Seems a bit unfair when Salesforce gives an executive a $200,000 car and $86,000 watch as a bonus for exceptional work, when you have witnessed others do exceptional work on a smaller scale (not necessarily bringing in $8 million in Sales) and all they get is a Chatter shoutout from their manager or their name mentioned on a PowerPoint slide.

Horizontal movement is extremely scrutinized (they would rather hire inexperienced interns than in-house and train someone for a position) Company stocks are great. Bonuses are ok. Company has still a lot of room to grow which is great for its workers.,If you are the kind of person who thrives on appearance and taking credit for others work OR if you're a manager. Then this is the place for you. Work is not connected to pay. The impression of work is. Manager are pretty much guaranteed promotions every year if they don't distribute their budget on promoting their hires. I've known developer who've left because of this and also conscientious managers who were tired of playing the devil. Tripled in size in 3 years and the culture is no more. Now it's a hodgepodge of Microsoft and oracle.,15 people found this review helpful

7838,70,Keep innovating....,,5.0,"1. Salesforce R&D has one of the best talent in software industry. 2. Despite being the best in what they do, people are accessible, down to earth and very polite. You can pretty much talk to engineers/managers at any level at any time. 3. I can't speak for the whole R&D, but I have never felt any politics in engineering teams yet. Most importantly, I have never heard anyone talking ill about someone behind their back. The environement is very positive and people love what they are doing. 4. You are given sufficient time to understand your project, see the big picture and get training. 5. Work life balance is great, I never had to work overtime or weekends, expect for the planned releases, for which you get comp day off.","Salesforce has over 15k employees, about 90% of them are sales guys, which I can not speak for. For R&D: 1. Hiring standards has been deteriorating day by day. We used to be really great at it, but now we are hiring people blindly. If we are to maintain the quality, we need to standardize the process, and learn from top tech companies(as we claim to be one). We pay pretty well compared to top tech firms in bay area, and I am sure with right interview process and effort from recruiters(hire more recruiters and tell them to reach out to everyone), we should we able to hire great engineers. 2. We have too many titles in R&D, this is great to keep employees motivated and promote them and I get that. BUT, you got to respect the title. I have seen people with very less experience and contributions, becoming Principle Engineers. I bet, these so called Principle Engineers, wont be able to pass entry level engineer's interview at a good tech company. PLEASE FIX THIS. 3. Another thing which is hurting the quality of engineering organization is letting QAs move to development without any interviews. I agree with the idea of allowing people to move between roles and do different things, but we must maintain the same interview standards while doing so. We all know that hiring standards for dev and QA are far apart, then letting QAs move to dev so easily has become a shortcut and no one is getting benefitted by this other than the individual. This hurts both dev team (as now they have to explain every line of code to QA) and it also hurts QA team as they will always have to hire new QAs (since the existing ones become dev) 4. I am not sure if this is salesforce or recruiters, but they dont give you good equity if you dont negotiate hard. The equity I have seen so far is around 50% of what a tech company in bay area (at our level) offers. 5. We have a great work culture at company, which is getting polluted by more and more higher management coming from Microsoft and Oracle. I always wonder, why we never get higher management from companies we admire (Google, Facebook, LinkedIn....). Now, these new managers are polluting the culture by thier micromanagement philosophy of earliest companies. For instance, now managers are asking receipt for $7 lunch arranged for a team meeting. This is not salesforce.",9 people found this review helpful

The role is challenging since you get questions from everybody at the client ecosystem, from junior developers to CIO and BA's to Business leaders. You constantly move from technically complex issues to IT Strategy, adoption, and other matters. Pretty demanding. If you get an out of town customer, then you will be traveling as well (generally at least 50% - can be more).

Everyone works together.","You create your own way at Salesforce. You must be confident in your strengths and self aware of your weaknesses. They will not create that path for you, you have to do it. For some that is great, for others they need that plan laid out. Management can only help you so much in that. For a company growing this fast there are positions created everyday. You must have patience and savvy to find the next right role for yourself. Management will guide you, but you own your career. There isn't a defined path. You aren't always going to know all the options available. It's a very fast paced environment. For everyone to work together they must communicate well. This means seeking to understand, asking the right questions, and being flexible. In sales this requires confidence and humility, not arrogance. Egos can get in the way if they aren't controlled.

If you have a role where you get to travel, you get to stay in nice hotels and have a cushy budget for meals.","Main cons are that it's a huge corporation and things get done sloowwwwly compared to startups and smaller companies. No matter what your role, it seems there's someone else doing the exact same thing in a different part of the company who is completely siloed from you, and it all gets very confusing. Projects take a long time to complete because a million people need to approve. Many people just don't reply to emails or show up to meetings because they're ""too busy."" Still, I think it's a 4-star workplace because you can easily do good work and get paid well without stressing yourself out too much. My work-life balance is pretty good here compared to smaller companies that are more stressful, so in that sense it's a win.",1 person found this review helpful

Decent benefits Lots of left over food from catered lunches for meetings.,"As with any big company, the team you are on can drastically change your experience here but I am going to try to point out some of the general things. Also of note, before you read too much into the other reviews, take the time to notice how many of the 5 star reviews are can be summed up by ""great place to work but has growing pains"" or ""you get what you put in, slackers need not apply"". I will let you draw your own conclusion on why so many of these reviews sound like marketing message .... It doesnt look like ExactTarget understands that they are no longer a startup. The only people that thrive at ExactTarget are people that have no lives. 50+ hours of work a week is the norm and anyone that does less is considered a ""slacker"" as you might have seen in some of these other reviews. If you do the math, you'll realize that the decent paycheck, which is typically higher than the industry norm, ultimately falls woefully short when you look at how much you make an hour. As you work here, you come to find out that it is very much a cult mindset and you are either in or out. Job security comes from owning tribal knowledge of projects that are integrated in to the platform since documentation is apparently a running joke. There are many processes that have been implemented to ""streamline"" development but apparently the management style here is to implement ""solutions"" and ignore the results because the only thing that these processes have done is add one more point of failure to an already broken system. Contractors are treated as second class citizens. Its common knowledge. The way to get ahead is to brown nose and give up on life outside work. ET is founded on the principle that the reward for a job well done is an opportunity to do more. After the Salesforce acquisition morale and productivity have been at an all time low while frustrations and turn over have been on the other side of the scale.",5 people found this review helpful

8005,237,"Was a great company to work for, not anymore!",,3.0,Salesforce was an amazing company with great culture and work environment. It maintained its culture even during the years of exponential growth (2009-12). The talent at this company is phenomenal. Opportunities to contribute and grow were great.,"A bunch of Oracle execs were hired over the last 3 years, and they have been busy replicating the Oracle culture here. The worst changes to the company have come in at the beginning of 2015. Quality Engineering was de-prioritized across the R&D organization. Many of the QE execs have been given different roles (I am not complaining about this. To be fair, many of these so-called QE execs should be fired. Do we really need 10 VPs in Quality Engineering? QE heads are now reporting to development managers. The road ahead points to converting all teams to Engineering teams. So if you are a QE trying to get a job, look elsewhere. Do not listen to the drivel from the recruiters. QE ROLE IS ENDING AT SALESFORCE! Added to this, the conflicting priorities are ever increasing in this company. R&D is at its 3rd attempt to re-write the UI, and make it adaptive at the same time. The so-called Salesforce 1 app was a disaster. The next attempt is starting in 2015. Although there is not a lot of hope for it, many of the ""leaders"" driving this will surely make hay via promotions and stock grants.",Be the first to find this review helpful
8006,238,"Unless you are Sales, stay away.",,1.0,The barista is a total sweetheart. Their offices are nice too... but putting lipstick on a pig doesn't make it pretty.,"For being a tech company, this place could not keep anyone in IT for longer than 2 years, it seemed. Salesforce has a ridiculous hierarchy that is rather militant in the way it handles internal communications (""My door is always open; however, you better not come to me before person a, b, c, and d""). There is 0 transparency although they preach this in every pointless meeting they make you sit through. This company caters heavily to the Sales side of business, and no where else. If you are IT in any sense of that side of business, then you can expect to be held to your best performing day for your entire career no matter how much of an outlier that day was, if you prove to be competent with what you do you can expect to be overloaded with work enough for those who are not, and then held to their expectations on top of your own. Oh, and those people will get promoted before you, because you are too ""valuable"" to move from your spot. And you can never expect to hear what you do right; every 1:1 you have with management is everything that you could possibly be doing better, always. No thanks, no 'atta-boys, nothing. You think you have co-workers in other departments? The people you assist are your companies User's that you support? Maybe these co-workers/users are your future friends/buddies? No. You have customers. And you treat them as such at all times. Your co-workers for the first few months of being hired are pretty great typically, until the vibe of this company is finally realized; which leads them into the cutthroat, every (wo)man for his/herself environment that management breeds. As a cherry on the top; Salesforce has this underlying community called femmeforce. Now this could be innocent, and it could potentially do a lot of great things; however this is not what it is being used for and many of the current management are women who are extremely active in this community for the wrong reasons. In our office 90% of the people who are leaving/being bullied out are male, and 70-80% of the new hires are women. The obvious preferential treatment, and the lack of others who care enough to do anything about it is ulimately why I left this company. I performed in the top 5 of a 40+ member team consistently across all stats; closures, professionalism, ""customer"" satisfaction, SLA; however, I was still offered an ultimatum: a severance package that is really hard to look away from, or the promise of an official write up that would not go the way I wanted, just because I was male working under a radical feminist.

Visionary CEO Marc Benioff, created an idealistic culture where employees are paid to volunteer 50 hours a year, and the company matches their charitable donations up to $10K a year. At the company's San Francisco headquarters, employees have daily access to the best view on the West Coast, the 61st floor of Salesforce Tower. The workforce is generally smart, professional, and ethical. There are plenty of resources. Managers are on the whole receptive to new projects.","Because Salesforce is growing so fast – doubling its workforce and revenue over two years – many things get lost in the shuffle. Some teams have crushing workloads, while others are virtually forgotten. The prevailing infrastructure of the company is a parochial network of vice presidents operating independently. This leads to disconnection, and occasionally chaos. Teams duplicate work, work in contradictory directions, and compete pointlessly. Territoriality for budget and resources is rampant. There are no centralized checks and balances. If you have a bad or unethical warlord, you may be asked to do things that are counterproductive or even hurtful. The patchwork of fiefdoms across the company is so disconnected that many teams are unaware of similar teams within the company. Efforts to organize or connect strategies are met with resistance and sometimes hostility. A chief strategy officer with a team of connected project managers could address this, but many VPs don't want accountability. The result is work that doesn't rise above mediocrity. Salesforce is a great company comprised of dozens of mediocre companies. Those mediocre companies don't want to connect and be great because their leaders don't want to lose status. Once you see that you can't unsee it. Many workers grow cynical as a result. The famed ""Ohana"" (Hawaiian for family) doesn't penetrate the 300-yard stare of hardened coworkers who don't say hello in elevators.",7 people found this review helpful

8052,37,Straight out of college,"Jul 31, 2015 - Associate Member of Technical Staff, Quality Engineer in San Francisco, CA",5.0,"I had competitive offers from multiple companies, but I decided to go with Salesforce for a few reasons. What stuck out during the hiring process was: 1) I was a real person to Salesforce, and I really mattered. At another company in the Bay Area (which is widely considered to be *the* most prestigious company to work for... no specifics, but it's a search engine that starts with a G), I had an interviewer call me 1 hour late for an interview and 15 minutes late for the rescheduled interview, on top of telling me that their interview process was 6-8 weeks long and was totally inflexible. At Salesforce, on the other hand, every interview started right on the dot of the scheduled time and the hiring process was just under 3 weeks from beginning to end. I had to have special accommodations and stay an extra night after the interview due to a disability that makes it difficult to travel late at night, and they extended my hotel booking without any question. 2) All the employees are passionate about their work. This is because of a system called Open Opportunity Market where you are allowed to leave your team and join any other team with an open spot during releases. Basically, everyone does the job that they want and nobody is stuck in a role they hate. 3) Everyone is super friendly. My interviewers all asked me if I was comfortable, if I needed a break/anything to drink/a snack. Now that I'm here, I'm happy with the decision I made. I think my favorite thing about the company is that they are very open to change. Management really, really listens to what everyone wants, whether it's a change in development process or better snacks in the kitchen. The work/life balance is great - you can work remotely as often as you'd like and you can come in/leave whenever as long as you're productive. There's catered lunches all the time and a full-service coffee shop in the office. The parties are great (I was second row to see Metallica at a company party 2 weeks after I joined!) and the people are awesome.","The development process can be cumbersome. The build breaks very often, and grabbing one bad changelist that breaks an essential component of the build can totally nuke your productivity for a whole day.

8097,82,Slowly becoming one of the worst places I've ever worked,"Feb 27, 2019 - Director in San Francisco, CA",1.0,"The salary is good, at least in my role. As many have mentioned, Salesforce is still seen as a destination company and a market leader - so experience here looks good on a resume. I've met some great people here who have stimulated and challenged me - also made some great friends personally.","I mean...it's hard to know where to start but I'll try to do my best. First, a lot of people talk about career and promotions - and how there's little to know transparency about the process, nepotism is rampant and the like. The company knows this, which is why ES has done away with giving performance reviews. Now, instead of being clear on what exactly you need to do to move up the chain, they're putting this on you. The result is that many people get promoted solely for political/favoritism , and people who actually have technical skills can get lost if there is no one mentoring them on how to play the game. And as other people have mentioned, employees do get rated by their managers every year, but they never see the results of their evaluation. The typical ES response to this will be ""Salesforce is not for everyone"" - but this should not take the place of transparency around the promotion process, especially in a company that touts itself on being transparent in every other way. The whole situation is a really messed up way of dealing with the fact that there are too many talented and driven people here. Work life balance, especially in regional roles, is nonexistent. During a regional rotation, I was actually paid less than my San Francisco salary per our mobility policies, but I was expected to lead projects in San Francisco AND the regional location. The result was 15-18 hour days, 6 days per week. Even though I discussed the concerns I had with my manager, their response was the typical ""Maybe Salesforce just isn't for you."" The situation did finally get better after I sought legal advice, and realized that this type of working structure was actually illegal per the local environment. However, it was clear that the escalation was seen as politically incorrect, and the regional rotation quickly became a dead end with no career growth or development. I was lucky enough to find a team in San Francisco that was willing to take me as a way out, but I share this as a cautionary tale for anyone considering taking on a similar role. Make sure you have a good local attorney, as many teams at Salesforce are predatory, and see the rotational experience as a way to get you to take on more for less money - they will retaliate against you if you try to escalate concerns about your work environment (and on the other side, try getting anyone in San Francisco to take a call before 8am or after 5pm, and people will act like you're crazy - it's a complete double standard). Salesforce is going to start offering more and more roles like this outside of San Francisco to reduce costs, so be sure you know what you're getting yourself into and how you'll be supported if you take one of these on. Operations are a complete mess with many groups doing the same thing, each one trying to assert themselves. Ever since I've been here, there seems to be a focus on wellness, though this gets rebranded time and again as different initiatives. The end result is that people are super driven from 8-5, but cut corners so they can make it to that 5:30pm yoga class. I'm not saying people should work 24/7, but this is an example of how Salesforce and its culture often embody mixed messages (grow grow grow but make sure you have a balance). The result is a lot of groups who say ""This isn't my problem/I'm not owning it/Find someone else to talk to."" In a matrixed environment, this becomes really frustrating - especially as the company has gotten so much bigger. Ultimately, the Company is becoming larger and more bureaucratic - many employees are not receiving raises this year because the company wants to focus on bottom line growth at the expense of its people. At some point over the last 10 years, my day became 100% focused on managing the politics as opposed to creating value and focusing on work I enjoy. Because of this, I've decided to leave Salesforce after a long ride. It's bittersweet, but kind of like that song - ""You don't have to go home, but you can't stay here""; the writing is on the wall in terms of where this company is going - the culture has is getting more and more eroded with the growth. As a final word of warning, I will just encourage all potential candidates to take Salesforce marketing with a grain of salt. Salesforce is one of the only companies I know of that has an internal marketing team who is tasked with trying to tell you how you should feel about the company. Yes, it's true - they have done a lot of great things, but usually the motivation behind it is much more about showing how this initiative is part of the Salesforce brand, as opposed to genuinely providing assistance to someone or some organization that needs help.",64 people found this review helpful

Not only that my experience has been leadership on Sales and Service side have your back in even the toughest situations. Success of the customer is out at the forefront. I have seen this on the Success Mgmt and Sales side and anyone reading this should consider Salesforce as the real deal. Trust is the most important factor here and mostly this is evident throughout. Teaming and “Swarming” on an issue still makes for a great environment. Rarely will you find someone not willing to give you time or jump in for the team. If you want in know your worth. Have solid use cases that show how you provided value to the customer not just leaders who asked you what to do. The most important part is improving our customers experience.,Strat is a high stakes game and not for the faint at heart. Expect to deal with challenges and adversity. This is almost not a con as I would expect anyone coming into this role to know how to deal with this and succeed. There can be politics across Sales and Success.

8134,119,The Saas Leader,,5.0,"Salesforce is the best place for someone in the intermediate to advanced stages of a software sales career period. You have unlimited resources, exposure, and are surrounded by the best of the best. The products lead the market, and 90% of the population here is an ""A"" player, confident and driven to succeed. The company is poised to dominate the CRM and Marketing industries for the next decade at least. In short, this is a fantastic opportunity to be a part of.","The culture is that of a big company, and success here is what you make of it. Nothing will be spoonfed, and it is up to the individual to sink or swim. Training is barebones(so seek out resources, and self motivate yourself to learn!), and many sales environments are hyper competitive. The organization is so big that there are redundant processes and internal politics, meaning that success here requires excellent externally facing and internally facing skills(or perhaps an opportunity to develop both for those starting their careers). For a company of this size, I don't think it is possible to avoid the aforementioned cons; that said, new employees who have only worked down or mid-market will need to adjust to a big company work environment, and won't receive much in the way of guidance as to how best to accomplish this.",7 people found this review helpful

I consider myself lucky to have worked in a company with very smart, talented and driven people.","The issues at Salesforce exist at the department / team level, which are led by terrible managers. This is obviously not the case with all departments - but my rating reflects my horrible experience with my department that has been embroiled in chaos for more than a year, with no end in sight. This department is central enough that the dysfunction here, will eventually result in a bad decisions for all other teams that interact with it. The leader of this department has created an unhealthy work culture, where people do things because of fear. The leader openly chides senior leadership in public for small infractions, and does not accept dissent. They have openly punished individuals for speaking up. The working style has become uninspiring because pomp and show are prioritized over true value creation - this is demonstrated by the fact that the top achievements of the department as highlighted by the leader themselves are theoretical frameworks, and not actual proven methodologies. There are many smart people on the team, but the leader has narrowed in to their insecurities and manipulates them to make sure they only do and say things the leader wants. Otherwise, they are very efficient on getting rid of people who do not “please” the leader one way or another. HR is kind but plays the therapist role rather than a facilitator. At least 25 people in our department have talked with HR. All we’ve heard is “Awww” and “it’ll get better, we will coach them” for the last 6 months. Can’t say we haven’t tried. We can’t all switch teams and ultimately it is the company’s responsibility to weed out bad leaders.

Some of the pros: - vibrant, fast paced culture - smart, fun, aggressive colleagues - management is focused on latest tech trends and staying or becoming a leader for many of them - by and large, customers and partners are very positive about the technology - good benefits and perqs - hip urban culture at HQ - a chart-your-own-course mentality that rewards those who aggressively seek out the job they want and pursue it, or sometimes even create it","After my long tenure and many Dreamforce conferences, I'm nearly fried. To say the culture is fast paced and the focus is always changing is an understatement. The reason Salesforce always seems on top, and chasing the latest trend, and in the press, is because employees are expected to run harder, carry more, cheer loudly, and pivot constantly. It's the world's biggest startup in behavior. But at the same time, with the recent influx of top career sales leaders from Oracle and what appears to be a board-level mandate for doubling revenue, employees are being asked to do even more with even less, fill higher quotas with smaller territories, less help, and the big company bureaucracy is rearing it's ugly head. Worse still is the politics. When you hire a bunch of smart, aggressive people, and put them in an environment of outsized expectations, throw in a bunch of re-orgs and changing management, and sprinkle with uncertainty and constantly changing priorities, you inevitably get people back stabbing each other and throwing others under the bus to appear smarter and more worthy of promotion.

Meanwhile, there's zero knowledge management to speak of -- we are literally incessantly filling out shared docs with the same information multiple times outside of the CRM. and everyone on the account team loses the plot. Who would have thunk? Salesforce is cost cutting in an effort to reach profitability. Goodbye parties, offsites, and non customer-facing travel. Benefits aren't cheap -- I'm paying well over $400/mo. for mine. It's been observed that they are systematically pushing workers 40+ out of the business to hire less experienced / new grads for less -- a ""best practice"" of private equity companies that seems to be catching on like wildfire in tech. Last but not least, at a company that espouses the values that it does, I am surprised that so many offsite events and outings include a ridiculous amount of drinking. Not ONCE has our team done a group volunteering outing or something to serve our community (and I'm at HQ in San Francisco).

8212,197,Account Executive,,5.0,"Product are unbelievable. Culture, unbelievable.

Nearly every AE was recruited & led to believe that ""although your base salary appears low - you will make that up in overtime."" AE's work 50+ hours. This isn't an expectation - it's simply about owning your responsibilities required to do a good job for our customers. In the past, logging honest hours hasn't been an issue - AE's logged hours according to the work put in. This year however, it is ""48 hours or less...if you are logging more than 50 hours, you're not efficient"" .... This is concerning b/c it represents a subtle undertone of apathy to AE's. We were recruited under the notion we would be allowed to log the hours we worked. If the company is moving away from paying hourly, then the salaries should adjust accordingly - b/c this was the #1 negotiation tactic used by Salesforce recruiters to lowball base salaries. But again, the bigger concern here is how it makes AE's feel. We assume Salesforce looks out for our best interest, especially those putting in the extra hours to get the job done.

8220,205,"If there was somewhere else better...I'd be there... But yep, it has it's problems...","Nov 1, 2013 - Sales in San Francisco, CA",4.0,"The best product by far...bar none. The best visionaries, technical ops (the guys that keep the platform up and running), and internal platform engineers on the planet - these are the guys that deserve all the glory. What is done behind the scenes to keep the app going is nothing short of amazing - several million concurrent users while constantly adding functionality and innovating...and no down time? Come on. It's ridiculous. The tenured and long-timers that are still around are incredible. They're not only the best in the company, they're the best in the industry. Prove yourself to them and they will take care of you. If YOU have the drive and the ability, you can build a career path in the company...and if YOU make a case and have something behind it, it's one of the few companies in the world that will allow you to do so. Salesforce will not give you a map when you're hired that shows you a career path...but if you succeed in the role you're giving and prove yourself and earn trust, they'll actually allow you to create your own. The culture of the company is like nothing else in the world. Yes...you are expected to work more than anywhere else in the world...but if you like philanthropy, no questions asked...go do it - on company time. The best in the business keep coming on board. Marc is the best CEO in the business - different for sure - but the best. For a few years I thought the company had plateaued...several different times (at $750M...at $1B..at $2B...)...but I really do see this company making it to $10B in rev and beyond. Without a doubt. So if you're considering joining Salesforce but are worried about growth, don't be. That should be the last of your concerns.","""Fillers"". I call them ""fillers"" because that's what they are...people that were hired in haste to simple fill roles in an organization that is growing so fast, they had to be hired quickly. While they may have gone through multiple rounds of interviews, it seems there are many execs that got through that shouldn't have and are just filling a role in the org chart. And they don't do s*&^. They may have had extremely successful positions at other companies, but Salesforce isn't like other companies. They only slow you down...so if you're smart and have your i's dotted and t's crossed, just go over them and it's not really looked down upon. Tomorrow. You're only as good as the deal you have committed tomorrow. Doesn't matter if you're at 200% of quota for the year 6 months into it ...that actually only amplifies what is expected of you. It's a con...but in reality...it's also not too bad...unless you're in a Sales role that isn't an AE (i.e. SE) because you're capped. Salesforce has the SE's I've ever come across in the industry, and I don't think they're treated as fairly as they should be. Marketeering. This is a new issue at Salesforce... It used to be the case that marketing & PM were in line and no one sold on futures. Over the past 12 months, that has changed...moving closer to an Oracle-like model where the vision is pitched and then they try to build it. Equity. I'm not sure who is getting it, but it isn't long term sales people. Seekingalpha? They couldn't be more wrong. Granted, the ESPP program is fantastic, but once you get beyond entry level, it would be nice to see something. It can be disheartening to hear RVP's (in 2012 I swear they only brought in people as RVP's...""What? You're an RVP of WHAT? And have no reports?!?!?"") and other new employees talking about selling their RSU's or options when they haven't really done anything for the company yet and you've committed the better part of a decade. Commit. This is probably the biggest ""Con"" at Salesforce if you're an AE or in sales. Salesforce is an accurate machine...it really is...based on the subscription model, a great portion of deferred rev is already established and known...but they want your sales opps just as accurate and mgmt will force or override you on your deals if you think differently. Territory. Don't come to Salesforce thinking you'll be able to pick and choose. It was picked over 5 years ago. You'll more than likely get something you don't want. End of discussion. While it seems like it should be the biggest ""con"", it's not. Because everything I listed in the ""Pros"" section means you will constantly have something new and innovative to sell to that minuscule territory you have that no one else can. I mentioned in the ""Pros"" section that some of the long-termers (those that have been around 10+ years) are one of the best things about the company. They ARE. There are also a handful of high level execs that just need to go...they don't do anything...they show up at meetings and say hello and leave... and you better keep your mouth shut. It sucks.

Many orgs (specifically marketing, but I've heard sales as well) are full of politics, mud slinging and power grabs. Senior leadership seems to acknowledge this recently, however there are no consequences for the people that perpetuate this type of environment. Toxic employees who produce results in their job are protected, even when multiple complaints are surfaced through the appropriate channels.",6 people found this review helpful

8271,256,"If your company is getting acquired by Salesforce, be careful","Jun 22, 2016 -",2.0,"- 5 months after my company was acquired by Salesforce, I was ultimately transferred to a manager who was very kind and understanding. Despite having my team thrown upon him, he tried the best that he could without knowing anything about us. He did not micro-manage and I thoroughly enjoyed working for him. I appreciated everything he did for me, but ultimately, he did not have enough power to change the situation. - I loved the people I worked with at my original acquired company and still got to work with them closely after the acquisition. - Good snacks and wellness benefits.","- If you come from an acquisition, Salesforce isn’t going to pay you as well as they pay their internal employees. Even if you are doing the same exact job as someone inside Salesforce, you will probably be making significantly less than what a core employee will be making. It was extremely frustrating and completely demeaning to hear all the hype and news about how Salesforce employees are so happy with their compensation and how Salesforce is making strides towards equal pay. Apparently, acquired company employees are not part of that equation and we do not hold as much value and shouldn’t be treated as equals…ridiculous. I asked for a compensation change in order to match or even come close to the pay of my peers within the Salesforce organization but was told that Salesforce does not have enough internal data to justify a compensation change. Essentially, there was no proof at Salesforce that I was worth a compensation change. This blew my mind because when you first hire someone, you have no proof internally that they are worth the salary that you are going to pay them. What you do instead is evaluate their past experiences and then you determine what is fair pay based on their experiences, skills, and the job that they are doing. You have no internal data or proof in that situation. If you acquire a company, yes, you have no Salesforce data to prove that an employee is worth a certain salary but you acquired a product that you clearly thought had value and the people who helped to create that product are not worth a compensation change because you don't have enough data? I had been working for the acquired company for almost a year, but all of that was meaningless because if you're acquired, it seems like you're not truly a ""Salesforce employee"" and being paid fairly is not something that applies to you. - Our entire acquisition process was a complete mess. My team and I essentially had to operate “as normal” which was completely impossible given that all of our management and the rest of the company were trying to figure out the acquisition themselves. We were lost in the transition, did not have managers for quite some time, and were essentially left to fend for ourselves for the better part of 4 months. It didn’t seem like the M&A team knew what to do with us and had forgotten we existed. - During the acquisition process, we were told that there would be tons of opportunities within the Salesforce organization but once we were in the Salesforce organization, in reality, there were no opportunities. We contacted departments and teams we were interested in and were repeatedly told that they were not hiring or that you needed XYZ experiences that none of us had. We had no choice in what department or role we were assigned. A role was thrown on us, whether we liked it or not, with no other presented opportunities. - My team and I were expected to hit ridiculous numbers as soon as we were acquired despite the fact that we were not fully integrated, did not receive the goal numbers until halfway through a quarter, and still had to facilitate the entire merging of all our systems with Salesforce's systems. We received very little support from the core Salesforce organization and were treated as if we were incompetent because we could not hit these numbers. It seemed like my team and I were being set up for failure so that the core team had a reason to get rid of us once we did not hit a specific goal.",32 people found this review helpful

Only those who are level 7 and above are eligible to receive equity grants. A large cohort of employees under level 7 are EAs, who are mostly female. Meaning that women are still not being treated equitably when it comes to overall pay. Sure, they can purchase stock through the ESPP, but that means they have to still pay out of pocket for something that other employees are given.

Some management within Enterprise space power trip. Have massive egos. (Not all are like this as some are incredibly humble and well respected)",4 people found this review helpful

You don't feel trusted. - Unrealistic workloads. - Encouraged to manage your work life balance but chastised if you actually do it. I've been scolded for having my car serviced at 2pm, or taking annual leave at a quarter cut off to celebrate a birthday. - Meetings for meetings sake burning precious time. - Saturated account sets. Prospects get bombarded continually from all angles of Salesforce and have been for over a decade. - Lead generation is down to you. You have to be BDR, AE and even SE on some opportunities, unless you're in the enterprise/strategic accounts. I have not had more than 3 leads passed to me in almost 18 months. - Always an ""urgent"" action that needs to be taken.

8467,182,Great solutions and people - inept local senior management,,3.0,Salesforce has some fantastic solutions and some really passionate people who care about their customers and each other. The benefits are great and when you have the right team you can win business. For the right job this company is a no brainer to join.,Local leadership is so focused on female diversity outcomes that talented internal and external candidates that don’t fit that profile are overlooked. Very “stepford wives” without any people of colour in senior roles within the CEO’s direct business (at least that was the case last year). Lots of people politic to get promoted - straight talkers and doers are often side lined vs “brand” individuals. Targets have become unrealistic and territories are carved so thin that by staying you are effectively giving yourself a pay cut each year. The culture has become bloated with self importance. Nothing humble about the way it’s presented. Over focus on certification and pointless training. Seems to keep an army busy while the workers barely get time to see customers anymore. Work/life balance depends on your role. Plenty of people seem to have lots of time to be volunteering or involved in non-revenue generating activities while other people are smashed.,9 people found this review helpful

8556,13,"Not so ""Ohana"" after all !!!","Sep 4, 2020 - Customer Success Manager in Hyderābād",1.0,Free food( loads of it) Lots of sugar to keep you excited about your company ( at the same time they want you to be healthy) Great office ( even though the decision of if you will get a seat depends on which team you work for),"Equality (Pun intended): IN spite of one of the core values of the company being Equality, the organization is RIFE with inequality. It first starts with who gets a seat at work. A company that boasts of technology and how they help businesses, they have no idea of what their growth is or will be. The tech teams grow inorganically leaving all the other teams to cram into rooms. There is clear discrimination right from senior leadership on who gets a seat and who does not. Tech teams are treated like kings and no one ( including the CTO)has the power to change their minds. There is a very heavy tone of ""ENTITLEMENT"" when any one approaches these tech teams or in discussions with them , something the company is very proud of. Even the facility team listens to what the leaders have to say and implement them. The Internal communication board even has a forum for people to vent, that is a great place for humor, with people complaining about the flavor of yogurt served in the fridge and many more trivial things.This (in)equality is not just limited to seating options but to pay, travel benefits and how they are treated by the infamous HRBP's ( or the human resources) They too clearly are unequal to teams, paying full attention to Tech teams and quite clearly ignoring smaller teams. I have met my ESBP twice till now ( official meetings) in my entire tenure as they are too busy taking care of the bigger teams. And who is there to ask them or question them, no one!! They seem to be the busiest team in the office while none of them are visible in the office post 4PM, imagine now when it is virtual. Talk about an easy job in Salesforce. Then there is a great term that they keep using ""OHANA"" like from an episode of Black Mirror they want to make sure you get sucked in to the idea of ,while the company really does not care. BTW that means' Family"" in Hawaiian, while no one is treated like one. Just giving people a lot of cupcakes and goodies( SWAG as they call it) is only marketing their company and the employees lap it up like puppies with a new chew toy. This is what the company's idea of a family is, give them stuff that is absolutely unnecessary and make them feel like they get ""SO MUCH"". Employees need to be bribed to fill up surveys, because well they don't do anything without a ""gift"". Any one who is planning to work for this organization should be particular about their ethics policies, which is an absolute joke.I am aware of some employees who were victims of this team, they either did not get justice for their complaint or were terminated for wrong decisions. I wish I had that kind of job where I can decide peoples' fates based on whims and fancies and no one to answer to. I strongly believe they have monthly targets to get people off the rolls! I know the HR team will scramble and get this review off this platform in an instant ( BTW one of the other values of the company is transparency). India offices are filled with wrong leaders and sadly nothing from the above will change.",11 people found this review helpful

8575,32,Obsolete Management and Working Style.,,1.0,"Benefits such as wellness allowance, great office location (centre of Tokyo).","JP office is extremely domestic, and does not have the drive, momentum or speed which other international tech firms or a typical foreign sub company has as a working culture. Since the majority of the people in the back office has been working here for a very long time (which is a good thing in one way), many of them are not use to changes - rather prefer to stick to the norm. Ohana is one of the key culture (which is a great conceptually) in Salesforce. But in JP back office, this is recognized in a different/miss leading manner. More specifically, it's been recognized as ""protection"", rather than supporting and challenging each other for growth. This shows up as lack of ownership, professionalism and extremely conservative working style/attitude. If you try to challenge someone, you're taken in a different way. Since there's really no culture of challenging each other, it's taken very offensively --- that's still fine but the most shocking part is, senior management doesn't notice or understand anymore of the benefits of growth via challenges and constructive communication. This is one of the most disappointing aspects of this office where it doesn't show to the outer world --- I have seen another review saying ""a master of disguise"" and completely understand what it means. When joining, do not expect a high paced, competitive working style lead by professionals with strong ownership --- but rather expect a conservative environment, hence for those who are looking for growth via challenges, constructive communication and data driven decision makings, this may not be the best place for you. Money is good, but growth wise, not able to recommend.",5 people found this review helpful

I've had a change in manager in the six months I've been at the company and the whole process was managed really smoothly. I have huge respect for the management and the way that the department functions with AE's and SE's. Support through COVID and having to work from home 5 weeks after starting was amazing. There was financial supporting in getting home office equipment and there were plenty of resources made available to ensure mental and physical health through lockdown. These resources are still in place now (daily wellbeing sessions, email updates and weekly leadership sessions to name but a few).",- There is never enough time in the week to learn everything and it can sometimes be overwhelming to try and get up to speed on the products (particularly when the company is buying new companies all the time and creating products for the market to deal with COVID workplace issues in addition).,1 person found this review helpful

It not only makes you feel that you are making a difference, it also makes you more credible in the eyes of the customer. You can have the joy of working with some great people with sharp minds that embodies the Ohana mindset.","This was once a company I genuinely felt pride in working for. Now the narrative has slipped into a sense of window dressing for the media and the market which shines through in several ways: Time tracking and process adherence seems to have taken over every corner of the company. A few years ago you felt that you were encourage to be innovative and to spend time on deep level analysis. Now you have to justify every hour of your day and not necessarily to to the benefit of the customer. Turning more Oracle than Google. Work load pressure is immense and there is an increasing number of people on long term sick leave due to stress. Managers are very often in a different location to you and there is very little awareness of the difficulty this can pose around communication, a sense of overwhelm and time available. HR does not have a presence in the smaller countries. This affects the health of both staff and relations as employees do not know who to turn to for a ‘sanity check’ conversation if a situations arise. HR processes are clearly there to support management and protect the company. There is a lot of talk about the feedback culture but the reality is that constructive criticism only works with few of the managers. Overall the sense is that the many hires from Microsoft, Oracle and similar has begun to take over the company mindset. It is much more ‘Me First’ than what is to the benefit of us all - and the customers.",8 people found this review helpful

If you’re new you’re 90% certain to get a terrible patch. Middle management is weak - usually people that have survived long enough. Senior management is a revolving door like football managers.

8747,204,Bullying amongst female employees a HUGE problem,"Apr 2, 2020 - Director in Toronto, ON",2.0,Competitive salaries Ability to progress within company Volunteering opportunities,"I had a wonderful experience working with Salesforce for the first 3 years of my employment there. However, for the 18 months that followed, my life was made hell. I am so disappointed to say that this was a result of constant bullying from female employees. I had been cursed at and shouted at by a senior female leader repeatedly and in front of other employees, and when reported this to my director was told that there was nothing he could do as she was a VP. This went on for a year. There was extreme and constant bullying, negativity and back-stabbing from females in the US Marketing department, so much so that when a colleague went to interview for that department, the Head of Marketing told her they were having lots of problems on the team with bullying and back-stabbing etc, and was it something she would be able to deal with (the answer to which was obviously no). This type of bullying just became the norm, and was totally accepted. My own first line manager, who was also female, was incapable of giving any type of constructive or positive feedback, particularly to female members of the team, would openly speak negatively about senior leaders in a team meeting setting and was regularly described as being extremely de-motivating by all team members. Again when reported to more senior leadership nothing at all was done about this. I would regularly end my day in tears, spending more time trying to ward off this bullying than being able to focus on my actual work. All of this was documented to my director, and to Employee Services however nothing was done about it. My director would speak with me maybe once every 3-4 months, so I was subjected to bullying by my manager and made to cope with this by myself. My mental health, sleep, appetite and general well-being suffered dramatically and when I mentioned this to my director he told me that I should just go to Employee Services, he also asked if maybe I was having personal issues. Again, my first few years with Salesforce were great, I had amazing team members, male and (amazing) female leaders in Ireland and Canada. However working with management and marketing dept in the US was an entirely different experience and in the end proved to be unbearable. I was stuck in a horrible situation for far too long, with no support or outlet, totally isolated and unable to seek guidance from management. I do hope something is done about the widespread and consistent bullying that is carried out by female employees in the US offices, particularly with regard to the infamously volatile and toxic Marketing Department.",21 people found this review helpful

8775,232,It’s changed,,3.0,There are some pros for Salesforce but most of them lie in benefits and compensation. Certainly this is one of the better paying companies in Toronto particularly in the non-sales world. Yes there are also snacks etc if you like that sort of thing and are drawn to it. It’s also nice that when you leave you can put Salesforce on the resume. Nobody can say that’s not a good thing.,"There’s a lack of trust in some leadership. Coaching is at a minimum. Having had roughly 9 managers in my tenure, I’ve had only two who have provided feedback to help me grow. That’s not a very good ratio. My current one’s response when asked after a customer meeting with an executive was “I’ll let you know if you’re doing something wrong”. That’s not in any way helpful. It’s impossible that I’ve done everything right in one of those meetings and I expect feedback to help me grow. I’m not asking for my hand to be held. I’m asking for guidance. Something you expect from your leader. The office can be quite clique-y and you have to fight your way in. Not quite the Ohana people hear about from the CEO.",12 people found this review helpful

8780,237,Do your due diligence and put some thought into Salesforce before joining,,2.0,"1. The Salesforce Platform is actually awesome and can be integrated into just about any business in some capacity. 2. Pretty good benefits although they are pretty standard for a tech company. 3. Office snacks and drinks are good, although many tech companies offer their employees catered lunch which Salesforce doesn't. 4. There are a lot of intelligent sales people that you can learn a lot from. 5. You get more leniency on working from home the more senior the sales role you are in.","-The Salesforce recipe is to grow and split territories and squeeze every rep as much as they can. This is how they report double-digit growth every year to their investors. -You are compensated the same irrespective of the products you sell, however, management only cares about the core products you sell (Sales/Service Cloud). To the outside world this may not make sense, however, you are looked down upon and will get performance managed if you are not selling enough of these core products. I'm not a lawyer but this doesn't sound legal under Canadian labour law. -“Teacher’s Pet” Culture - Majority of reps (80%) don’t hit their quota but you can still get promoted and have your career accelerated if you play the “game” and suck up to management. -Colleagues who have been here for a while say it used to be an exciting, fun company and now it’s far more corporate and there are a lot of unhappy people in the office.",18 people found this review helpful

8812,269,At the end Customer Success and Ohana is purely marketing,,1.0,You are part of the Ohana (family) until the day they don't need you,"I was debating whether to post this because I know it won't make a difference. But in the end, I decide to post this because I feel the need to share what we went through. Last month, Salesforce laid off a good number of customer success group members, including myself. I don't know the exact % or number, but it is not a small percentage. People will likely think I am negative toward the company because I got layoff. And you are right, who wouldn't be. Over the years, I truly believe in Salesforce and put lots of heart and soul into the company. This sudden layout is not fun and now gave me lots of uncertainty about my career and how do I support my family going forward. Salesforce talked a lot about Trust and Ohana, but this move killed both ideas for me. Where is the Trust when Salesforce let us go when the company is doing well and continue to hire many other roles. Where is the Ohana when Salesforce management cares purely about the books than the well being of the employee. Salesforce will say they are assisting those of us impacted to find another role internally. But the reality is there is little help, we are on our own to find a new position. There are some great people internally trying to help, but they are doing it on their own and not because Salesforce management asked them to. Many other hiring managers wouldn't even give us the chance or response to us. I do not blame other Salesforce Ohana not sensitive to what happened to us, it didn't happen to them, so they do not feel our pain. The bottom line is Salesforce put the books over employees which is the opposite of everything Salesforce stand for and claim to be..",28 people found this review helpful

8840,297,Worst nightmare ever,,1.0,"-The product is amazing, nothing to say against. -The sales cycle is interest, many things to learn every day. -I want to believe that your experience and opinion about the company depends on the team you’ll be working in. -Health insurance and 5k to spend on a course per year. -Plenty of opportunities to grow.","-You basically can’t trust people in your own team cause they will find the way to steal your accounts and opportunities. -People are selfish and self-focused, they won’t help you unless they will get something in return. -If you are an Account Executive and you want to spend time with an SDR, you will be judged cause they hate each other (worse than a kindergarten). -No balance at all between work life and private life: you are asked to work at weekends, work at night after entire days in the office, work during bank holidays (well, bank holidays are not allowed). Allowed to take days off only in August and February. In some teams like mine you can’t even work from home. -You have to travel abroad 3/4 times per month and they want you to take flights at dawn or at night cause “you can’t lose working hours”. -One of the best values is volunteering - guess what? Underestimated and not taken for real in my team. -Managers only care about numbers, you are not a person at all. -People underestimate people working in other companies cause they feel they are the best but they are so poor and sad inside. -If people leave cause they feel bad, the other “teammates” and managers will make fun of them. -Micromanagement: your manager will expect to be cc’d in every single email you send to your customers.",25 people found this review helpful

8843,300,Fantastic place to work!,,5.0,"The three years I've worked for Salesforce within the ECS team have been the most impactful and enjoyable of my career. I work in a diverse team both culturally and cognitively, with over 13 different nationalities represented. There is a true feeling of family within the team, who are motivated, coachable and a true representation of the Salesforce Ohana values. I honestly look forward to coming to work everyday, to be part of the fantastic office atmosphere and contributing to something special. The leadership team have a brilliant ability to shape an effective go to market strategy and disseminate to the sales team, enabling consistent and immaculate execution. It's an exciting, fast moving business to work in with endless opportunities to develop and progress. The coaching is first class and whilst I develop professionally I'm also given the opportunity to give back to the community by volunteering my time to meaningful causes. It would be remiss of me to not mention here Zahid Jiwa, who leads the UK ECS team and has built something very special. He encapsulates the Salesforce core values and his team is a true representation of this. The impact he has had on my career has been profound.","It's a fast moving company so be prepared for change, which also brings lots of new opportunities",2 people found this review helpful

Great products which make the interactions with the clients very rewarding. The team mates are nice and fun even tough there is little actual team spirit and everyone rather fends for themselves.,"Micromanagement: We have WEEKLY targets which fist of all requires Sales reps to justify themselves every week and exerts unnecessary pressure to close deals to unrealistic timelines which is damaging the client relationship. This also leads to non-stop pressure on a weekly basis which leaves no time to regenerate after a stressful month-end. While we are free to structure our days as we wish there are countless data points collected in the CRM which is used as a tool by management to exert additional pressure. Management style: We are not treated like professionals but more like interns who are here to learn and need to proof we are worthy of doing the job we are hired for. There is nothing more important than closing as many deals as possible as quickly as possible. Based on this all decisions are made disregarding the client relationship, the professional opinion of the sales rep or the health and the wellbeing of the rep. Unrealistic goals: Quotas are set unrealistically and only a handful of people are going to make their targets this year. On a bad month you go home with 2000 Euro which does not leave you much to live with an average room rent of 1200 Euro. Two of the teammates even live in camper vans.",31 people found this review helpful

Mark promised no layoffs for 3 months, and looked like he was waiting for 3 months to be over. LOL. 2] Unhealthy competition between global teams. US teams typically are more prone to hiding information from other teams across the globe. If you don't know the requirement, you can't build the system, and if you can't build the system, you are labelled as incompetent. (Sr.) Directors/ (Sr.) Managers will NEVER take accountability to gather the necessary information, and delegate all work to ICs (even freshers in some case). Since ICs are ill-equipped to make senior managers or directors in the US to divulge information, they practically get blocked, which results in underperformance discussions for ICs. This brings me to the next important claim by Salesforce - ""Embrace Feedback and Promote Transparency""! 3] I personally know people who would speak up to management (""see something, say something""). Somehow, those were the people who typically got impacted by ""restructuring"". Secondly, all this talk about transparency, and they won't divulge your performance ratings to you. This is the only place this happens. So my question is, if the employee doesn't know how the manager sees their performance, how would they take an informed decision on what next to expect or even challenge that assessment. The performance conversations are always positive from managers, so managers don't need to worry about the internal survey ratings from their team! OH MY, WHAT A MESS. Who's to stop managers from saying you performed awesome, but put a rating of 2 in the backend system? There are more, but I think you would have got an idea by now that the work environment is, at best, extremely toxic inside the sugar coated candy that gets presented to the outside world.",4 people found this review helpful

Rarely does a week go by when I am not astonished by the quality of the people I work with. The company is relentlessly focused on customer success. This focus is real, and not just a marketing message. The product itself is hands-down the best business application I have ever used. The salesforce.com foundation is just plain cool and makes me proud.","No company is perfect. Salesforce.com isn't for everyone. The pace is relentless. It's a rocket-ride. But the flipside of that is that everyone is driving in the same direction and everyone knows the mission. For people who already think they know how things should be done, who understand how real companies operate, who learned their lessons in a prior decade and think they can come and bring these ideas to help salesforce.com ""grow-up"" - they usually feel like they are banging their heads into a wall. Everyone who joins starts by starting over - learning some of the fundamentals that make the company different, and IMHO better than the traditional software or technology companies.",2 people found this review helpful

Does YOUR company have Stevie Wonder as the opening act of your CEO's keynote speech? Hmm? Everything about the company is world class. The benefits, the opportunities, the projects, the technology, and even the compensation for most roles. Some of the sales reps get a raw deal with territories, but if you're one of the lucky ones, you can really do well. Salesforce continues to lead the pack in innovative social policies. They were one of the first major companies to initiate a comprehensive review of female compensation, which is very much appreciated. Some women at the company received substantial raises, which one one hand is great, but on the other hand raises some uncomfortable questions.","This is a tough one, because I love this company in so many ways. I'm not a bitter ex-employee; on the contrary, I'm extremely happy here and I want to have a long career with Salesforce. That's what breaks my heart about how little commitment to diversity the company has. To illustrate the point, I am black, and I cannot reveal my gender and office location, because doing so would reveal my identity. That's how few black employees we have at the company. Now, it's easy to fall back on the usual tech industry explanation of there being a ""pipeline issue"" that ties to minority education in STEM. There's absolutely truth to that, as you can't recruit what's not there. But here's the thing: when you fill your ranks with the same type of people in order to maintain some sort of ""company culture"", you create an environment in which the employees don't have enough exposure to people not like them to think of them as co-workers. The proof? If even your fictional website, PowerPoint and product demo characters are all white, there's a deeper problem than a simple ""pipeline issue"".

Employee success was paramount to company success, and we had a leadership team that recognized that. Now, with the infiltration of Salesforce (which, don't get me wrong, Salesforce is great in its own way, but that greatness has not manifested in Indianapolis - it's been mostly destructive), the Marketing Cloud leadership team is much more concerned with making people like Marc Benioff and Alex Dayyon happy rather than creating a culture of happy employees. In a recent ""V2MOM"" session, leadership blatantly voted ""employee success"" as the LEAST important value among 6-7 value options. Don't you get it? Happy and successful employees lead to good product, good service, and thriving business!! As I look around, I see a bunch of people sitting there just doing bare minimum to collect a paycheck, others frantically trying to cling to the last bit of Orange culture they can find, and a select few who thrive in this new environment of ""nothing matters but the bottom line"". I'm sure that the short term business outlook will be great, as Salesforce manages to squeeze the last bit of quality work out of employees, but if this keeps up, there's no long term to speak of.",12 people found this review helpful

For example, 6 months in, I have yet to have any kind of a review or coaching. There's also a common thread of jaded sales reps here. For example, ""I took x account almost to the finish line, the fiscal year ended, and someone else got credit for the deal."" This is a systemic problem because I have noticed those reps no longer enter information into Salesforce..what's the point if you'll lose the client next year. Team building - really another surprising gap here. I'm sure San Francisco HQ doesn't have this problem. Too new to be offended but the above is real.
