58,"A huge amount of customer information (transaction results, company information, person in charge information, etc.) can be put together in one system, and this information can be viewed by everyone, including sales representatives, bosses, and in-house assistants, so everyone involved in the project made customer management easier. In addition, when a customer is handed over from a predecessor to a successor due to internal transfers, it is less likely that information will be leaked in the system, which I think is also an advantage for the customer."

This was due to poor communication of the merits of data entry on site and the importance of it in terms of management's decision-making.

However, 3 months after the introduction, we hired an SF consultant for a short period of time.
The data input design has been reviewed, and the accuracy of dashboard design and creation has been improved.
As a result, we were able to share the image that we could visualize the data in this way if we had the data entered thoroughly."
